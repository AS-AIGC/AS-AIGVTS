The film mainly introduces the development and application of thermoelectric technology and thermoelectric materials, and emphasizes its importance in energy transition and energy efficiency improvement. Thermoelectric materials can be used in industries such as automobiles to improve energy efficiency, and can also be used in spacecraft, Mars exploration vehicles, etc. Different materials have their own properties at different temperatures.

However, the thermoelectric efficiency still needs to be improved, and more applications are found in alternative energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy. The government needs to actively develop renewable energy such as solar energy and wind energy to reduce dependence on energy that was no longer applicable in the past.

In the film, different modern technologies and power conversion challenges are also explored, such as OTEC technology that uses temperature differences to generate power, but the economics are yet to be improved. When discussing energy, it is necessary to consider the cost of power generation and economic benefits. Thermoelectric systems can increase efficiency and reduce prices. Although Germany and California invest in green energy, it is still difficult to replace nuclear energy in the short term. Different countries deal with nuclear waste in different ways. For example, India actively develops nuclear energy, and France adopts re-enrichment technology. For Taiwan, the problem of nuclear waste is serious, and the storage space is insufficient. It even considers reducing the production capacity of nuclear power plants. And Taiwan has achieved initial success in wind power generation. In addition, Taiwan's recycling achievements are closely related to voluntary organizations such as Tzu Chi, and have abundant methane ice resources. Research on space rockets can improve the country's international status. Finally, young people are called upon to participate in energy research. ,
