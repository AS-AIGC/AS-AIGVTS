00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Message

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,260
General Zhu is a very important political scientist

5
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,140
Professor Wu Yushan, I don't think I need a special introduction

6
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,740
You can sometimes see him in the newspapers

7
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,740
Comments on ten moves

8
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,740
But I still want to briefly introduce his resume

9
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,000
Dr Wu is a 1976 graduate of Jianguo Middle School

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,540
I think many of you recall the time in 1970

11
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
The international situation in Taiwan at that time

12
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,540
When official changes are dramatic

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,540
The international situation was already very unfavorable to the Republic of China at that time

14
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,540
So at that time, Dr. Wu was admitted to the Political Science Department of National Taiwan University for the first time.

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,540
Hope to make a difference to reality

16
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
Four years later he graduated first

17
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
In fact, he graduated first in all of them.

18
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,540
He graduated first from all of this

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,540
Then what

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,540
In order to understand the other side and international communism, I am admitted to politics

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Also graduated first in 1980

22

Director of Intervention Affairs from Associate Professor

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then in 2006 to Zhongyuan Institute

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
director of political science empowerment

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Currently a designated salesperson and director

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Dr. Lin got a lot of lives

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He has won national science awards three times

36

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And he also served as a member of the National Science and Technology Department

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Top Ph.D. players named in political science

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is the shaper of political science

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Fifteen books in English written and edited by him

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Books in Chinese and English More than 100 journals and book papers

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Here I should introduce Director Wu

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Director Wu does not need to read the documents

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because I know all too well about his whole academics and science too

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and adore

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
When I was in Guoke local culture modeling people

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I happen to be the director of the humanities department

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I have a lot of work with him

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There are also academic professors

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I also admire his research very much.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The topic he is going to talk about today

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was eating just now

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Exchange your relics with Director Wu

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I think it's an interesting topic

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And it's good for impromptu

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,600
i don't know how you guys are doing

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,120
I always think inside

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,520
Wow, political development should be like this today

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,160
It's almost there. The next game hasn't progressed yet.

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,880
10 years later

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Politics still has a new round

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,480
will affect the strength

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
Humans probably do

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,040
Talk about to the extent

73
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,160
Good and good, to the extent of the day

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,360
It will take 10 years for you to have a new situation

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,200
Then Secretary Wu will tell you today that history has not ended

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,360
It's not like Heige said

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
The history of NLP history does not end

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,200
meaning keeps changing

79
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,920
So the political situation in Taiwan

80
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Line of entry with competitive style

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,640
has been changing

82
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,920
what's next

83
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,760
we listen now

84
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,160
A Discussion by Secretary Wu of the Institute of Political Science

85
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,480
you applause

86
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,600
Thank you Vice President Wang

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,320
Also glad to have today

88
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,440
so many listeners

89
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,880
interested in this topic

90
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,120
then i

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,500
I think the way I'm going to talk about this today

92
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:09,200
On the one hand, it is based on my observation of some theories on this topic

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,900
On the one hand, I want to connect this issue with those around us.

94
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,700
This political phenomenon that everyone has personally experienced is combined

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,200
I'll try my best

96
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,500
Then I hope everyone can put forward your views and this question

97
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,100
When this person talks about a paragraph, let's discuss it together

98
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,200
The topic I want to talk about today is

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
From identity to economy

100
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,100
It is the axis transformation of Taiwan's political competition

101
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,600
Before I start, let me ask you to look at the two sets of pictures

102
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,300
then i won't say much

103
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
When you look at this picture

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,700
Maybe it will provide some of your memories and some feelings

105
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,800
Because we have brought meaning from these two sets of pictures, letâ€™s talk about

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's see it as a melting point of water

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
These are all things that happened to everyone

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The central government and Taipei City have different views on this matter

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I remember this scene

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
feel this cartoon

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
take this comic

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
take this comic

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It turns out that the same direction of President Chiang

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All concentrated in the mainland of Taoyuan

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Daxi went

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
if someone has visited

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All kinds of fellow countrymen are there

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is a series of induced movements

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
medium oil

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
ship

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In fact, when everyone was flat

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
we had a time

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That stamp is called Taiwan stamp

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Later Ma Ying-jeou came up

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It became the stamp of the Republic of China again

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a huge movement

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,000
ok then we all have to look down now

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ma Ying-jeou period

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:35,000
since 2008

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Fumao, there was a debate and now it's cancelled.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But of course it's still very controversial

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Some people even think that the fight between the two gentlemen Ma and Wang has something to do with this

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Dismantle the earth today, tear down the government tomorrow

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This catchphrase reminds everyone

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is the electric palm

136
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
at the end of last year

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This wave of military education

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Of course, it's also related to my husband.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
earn tax together

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
down a minister

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The report is now almost dead

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
good

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, these two sets of pictures

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Here's to the two presidents

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
era period

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
different social controversies

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
what did we see

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's start with these two sets of graphs

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
we look at any society

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
there is a way to understand it

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's where Clubwich is

152
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Basically we can divide into three types

153
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,000
a prematter

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,500
one is matter and one is post matter

155
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
In fact, how much is according to the new formula

156
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
differentiated by historical development

157
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
The former material Primitillist speaks of

158
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,000
ethnic group religion

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's very basic, very traditional

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
on the industrial side no

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
before coming

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
matter left and right

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So let's go into more detail

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Basically because after the revolution came

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
modern society

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In modern society, it is easy to divide into labor and capital

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
then this country

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
in this economy

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
what kind of position

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
it actively intervenes

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because the market is under-allocated

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Not even allowing the market to be replaced

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
this is socialism

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
or should it basically

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
respect all property

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Then this Qing Liao robbed the rich

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let the market do its thing

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
To create wealth for everyone

179
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,640
These two different views are divided into left and right

180
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,160
The Age of the Afterlife

181
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,220
It's the environment, for example, the Lu Party

182
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,520
or gender politics and so on

183
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,080
In the west we find

184
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,640
It is dominated by material differences

185
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
Here comes the industrial revolution

186
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,460
Positive differentiation occurs

187
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,520
different actors then have their own interests

188
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,320
The biggest controversy is what I just said

189
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,620
The role of the state in economic life

190
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,440
The so-called leftists mean that the state wants to intervene

191
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,040
That is to say, it is better for the state to intervene less

192
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,480
this in the present west

193
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
still the main axis of competition

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,720
It's interesting

195
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,360
in western countries

196
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,640
Almost always make a distinction between left and right

197
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,880
so like in america

198
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,720
it compares to the left

199
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,120
Of course, the United States as a whole is relatively right.

200
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,400
But it is relatively left

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,600
is the Democratic Party

202
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
right is republican

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
Britain is more left

204
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,560
Is the public party

205
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,960
Paulista on the right

206
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,400
There's a Lipdance over here

207
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,080
That right said it was in Germany

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Just had a general election, right?

209
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,440
To the left are the Social Democrats

210
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,240
right

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,840
The right might be the Christian Democrats

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,760
this

213
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,000
this

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,840
have such competing spindles

215
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,280
Political parties divide along this society

216
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,240
Collecting position

217
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,000
If the party

218
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,160
words that ignore major social divides

219
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,200
its political influence will be weakened

220
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,160
Now everyone is arguing about one thing

221
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,520
then i jumped out

222
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,480
make a claim

223
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,120
no one knows what i'm doing

224
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,080
They will quarrel with him today

225
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,680
Your political influence is gone

226
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,440
in western countries

227
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,920
Prominence of material divergence

228
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,720
is the majority party

229
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
take left and right positions

230
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,560
Of course in some cases

231
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,920
can still see

232
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
pre-substance divergence

233
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,920
for example

234
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,480
will be held in 2014

235
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,520
Is it from the UK

236
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,640
It should be said United Kingdom

237
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,240
independent scotland

238
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,000
for example

239
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,300
in mainland spain to catalonia

240
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,860
It's from Barcelona

241
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,820
it is strongly independent

242
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,060
this tendency

243
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,900
Kerbac in Canada

244
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
There has always been such a trend

245
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,020
France also has

246
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,780
But basically

247
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,420
those are the few main ones

248
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,500
still around

249
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,760
But in selfish democracies

250
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,900
This is not the case anymore

251
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,100
Because of the social divisions in many of these countries

252
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,860
it may be latent

253
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
good

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
if there is

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
specific social divisions

256
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
then you will have

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Certainly the party system

258
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
with it

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Your social divide on the left

260
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You'll be a party of the left and the right

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
if say your

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
society has experienced some

263
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
major development

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
it may change

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
One even

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
bring out new social divisions

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Social divisions may change

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
no

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,740
never change

270
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,300
So the new social pit period

271
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,160
May replace old divergence

272
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,440
or the old one here

273
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,040
Separate the symphony after the new one appears

274
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,740
then exist together

275
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,640
Political parties have to chase votes, right?

276
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,080
so he has to pay close attention

277
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,840
Is there a new topic

278
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,340
Is there a new disagreement

279
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,640
So it appeared

280
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Party redirection through elections

281
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240
his

282
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,340
The reason why his political party will follow the divide

283
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,840
Going because he wants votes

284
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,240
Then the difference is decided

285
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,440
What is the society most concerned about

286
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,980
so you have to follow him around

287
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,480
let me give you an example

288
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,940
In the UK the Conservative Party is called Toy

289
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,840
Historically he was a royalist

290
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,240
Of course it is impossible to imagine now

291
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,640
there will be a party in england

292
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,340
He asserted that the king's right is still the greatest

293
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,440
This Toy has become a white-handed political party

294
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,980
so he has to follow this

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,440
Time changes with the development of this history

296
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
So social divisions change

297
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,640
Political parties follow it

298
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,440
So a social divide turns into a new political divide

299
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,480
Let's take a closer look at how this process came about.

300
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,760
Do you think some of the political parties are more innovative?

301
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,360
it adjusts its position

302
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
then it wins the election

303
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,120
why ? because new differences have arisen

304
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,520
Laggards will be under strong pressure

305
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,640
he also has to adjust

306
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,600
Because someone has changed

307
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,920
you have to change

308
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,720
no way to adjust

309
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,400
will lose votes

310
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,240
Even the party is gone

311
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,960
It's a thief

312
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,640
fit for party survival

313
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:55,560
Everyone knows that I am based on what Darwin said in biology.

314
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,040
It's a thief

315
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
fit survival

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,480
the party

317
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,820
can have several results

318
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,380
One is the original political party is still maintained

319
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,460
But the party has actually changed

320
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,520
It's as if the Royalists in England have now become the Conservatives

321
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,940
So we see that these parties are still competing on the table

322
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,740
But it's really a new issue

323
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,680
new differences

324
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
Or there is a new political party

325
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,300
replaced the old party

326
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,180
so let me say something first

327
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,940
What we see today is like what Vice President Wang just mentioned

328
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,620
what we see now

329
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,900
profit blue profit

330
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,740
Kuomintang Democratic Progressive Party

331
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,140
Then they argue about something

332
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,580
then we feel

333
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,500
Wow, it's been like this for so many years

334
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,060
nothing

335
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,860
nothing

336
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,180
Social divides can change

337
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,820
And when social divisions change

338
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,380
Political parties must follow suit

339
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,340
otherwise

340
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,220
he might disappear

341
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,760
die out

342
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,360
ok then let's look down

343
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,400
What is Taiwan like?

344
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,120
In the 1980s, Morgan's early nineties

345
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,280
Taiwan's democracy

346
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,200
There are two social divides

347
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
competing with each other

348
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,920
I remember very clearly

349
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,720
At that time, I happened to be from this

350
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,360
Desu Xuele

351
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,000
When preparing to return to Taiwan

352
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,960
Because then I'll keep an eye on it

353
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Taiwan's democracy has only just begun to emerge

354
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What kind of democracy will people treat you

355
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,800
Will there be class differences?

356
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,080
Western countries are like this

357
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,920
and leftists and rightists

358
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,160
There will also be leftists and rightists here in Taiwan

359
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,520
Then why is there such a thing

360
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,480
because it makes sense

361
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,640
Because the Kuomintang has been pursuing the pursuit of excellence in industry and commerce for many years

362
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,400
Economic Development Policy Based on Growth

363
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
At the same time trade unions are suppressed

364
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,440
we call this

365
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,160
developed capitalist countries

366
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
Captive Developmental State

367
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,600
So like this come more up

368
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
you now have political power

369
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,980
Yes, during that time we saw

370
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,920
sport with some features

371
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,080
i was studying in berkland

372
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,960
I found that there are many people who do functions

373
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,220
went to berkland to give a speech

374
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,720
I go to listen to every game

375
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,920
do you remember

376
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,460
At that time, the disciples also had a very powerful

377
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,960
this circular demonstration

378
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,000
and burned something

379
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Then opposed the policy at the time

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
democracy is coming

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,640
All kinds of social voices have risen

382
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Will this power come out?

383
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
or

384
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Subgroup-Based Identity Analysis

385
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Subgroup sub-asnik

386
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
because usually we don't think

387
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Han people in Taiwan

388
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Have a way with each other asnik

389
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
such a difference

390
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
but it does make a difference

391
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Usually called sub-asnik

392
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
In Taiwan, we will talk about provincial conflicts

393
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
is it that thing

394
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Because the Democratic Party has always emphasized

395
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
It is the resistance of the Chinese nation

396
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
outside the party

397
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
what is emphasized

398
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
Taiwan's Subjective Consciousness

399
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
this is also a conflict

400
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
So when you democratize

401
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,000
Many things were suppressed

402
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
now democratized

403
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,400
So what will emerge

404
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,600
a social divide

405
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,900
We found that as a result of later development

406
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,200
Identity politics trumps class and distribution

407
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
over twenty years

408
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,800
The Axis of Taiwan's Political Competition

409
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,300
from the 1990s to the 2000s

410
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,800
A tacit understanding until the 2000s

411
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
it's all like this

412
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,100
Taiwan is a very interesting phenomenon

413
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,900
Because people are people in Taiwan politics

414
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
can feel

415
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,200
we are not so easy

416
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,400
To talk to the Western democratic system

417
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,600
why? because they are left and right

418
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,200
we are agree

419
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
You know what the UK says about identity

420
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,800
Of course Scotland can have these

421
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,300
Axis of Basic Political Competition

422
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,100
not agreeing with this phenomenon

423
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,700
America is the same

424
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,500
But we are agreeing

425
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,900
we talk less

426
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,500
class

427
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,000
So I agree with Duxiu

428
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,260
Absence of left and right

429
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,900
No Influential Leftist Party Emerged in Taiwan

430
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,100
who are we

431
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,180
do we have a communist party

432
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,680
Yes, I have

433
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,460
We can often see a red flag on the street

434
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,440
and then there in the fifties

435
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,420
That song is quite majestic

436
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,300
all the way past

437
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,700
no one knows what he sings

438
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,940
Then the red flag is waving

439
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,820
that's all

440
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,220
we have the labor party

441
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,060
That's not really a leftist party either.

442
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,380
in our congress

443
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,380
no real leftist parties

444
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,380
Opposition to the KMT

445
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,380
later became the Democratic Party

446
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,180
he didn't adopt the platform of a party of the left

447
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,660
we don't have any major political parties

448
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,580
group as socialism

449
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,780
deep group socialism

450
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,180
by western standards

451
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,700
Taiwan's main political parties are left and right in ideology

452
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,580
right-handed on the spectrum

453
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,540
but our right

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
no ideological claims

455
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
let me give you an example

456
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
private property

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Property-wise is a very important thing

458
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
is extremely sacred

459
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
we don't feel that way either

460
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's basically a matter of left and right

461
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Disagreement in Taiwan

462
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That is undetdeveloped

463
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
we don't have that language

464
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
we don't have that concept

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
we don't have that awareness

466
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
isn't it good

467
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
seems to be good

468
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
but we replace it with something else

469
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
we have two bourgeois parties

470
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
KMT strengthens ties with factories

471
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
yes

472
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The DPP also has its own donors and money veins

473
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
electoral competition brings

474
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Huge need for political cash

475
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
underdeveloped trade unions

476
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
no way to party

477
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
provide financial assistance

478
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
We see election competition costs money

479
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
right

480
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
where does the money come from

481
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Of course the money comes from the rich

482
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
so it looks like

483
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Big business of course

484
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
bourgeoisie to prop

485
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But if you have a

486
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
words of a strong union

487
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
trade unions can be held accountable

488
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,800
his own strength to support the party

489
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I think it's good

490
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,500
because it's happening now

491
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,880
british labor party

492
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,340
In the long run, we will go together with the trade union

493
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,480
why

494
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,940
Because of the British trade unions

495
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,840
the membership they paid

496
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,180
Fees automatically become a source of funding for the Labor Party

497
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,680
Now this represents

498
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,780
british labor party leader

499
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,880
I want to change the country and cut this off

500
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,220
many people are shocked

501
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,680
So if you do this

502
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,120
So where does our Labor Party get its money from?

503
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
It is not conceivable at least so far

504
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,160
If the Labor Party, the Labor Party

505
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,380
its source of funding

506
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,720
A big part comes from joining the union

507
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,120
money donated by people

508
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,660
dues paid

509
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,520
Of course it has to reflect the interests of workers

510
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,060
Of course it has to reflect the interests of workers

511
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,500
Right

512
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:52,100
But our trade union is very naive

513
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,700
Because of course there is no union like that

514
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,700
I don't have that kind of wealth

515
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,640
So when this party is competing

516
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,560
As long as you have money, you can suppress it with both sides

517
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,600
so it produces

518
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,420
There is also a lack of control over political cash

519
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,920
The business community has a strong lobbying industry

520
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,000
I think we have six business products, right?

521
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,080
Type of work, type of business, industrial and commercial cooperation, industrial cooperation

522
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,840
small business

523
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,620
electricity electricity

524
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,160
One is better than the other

525
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,740
when you need the funds

526
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,520
You must ask them for help

527
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,340
Business and industry are closely related to the brain

528
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,620
Let's play golf together, right?

529
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,960
So social welfare increases

530
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,720
like

531
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,520
This is an unreasonable taste

532
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,560
But in fact it does not reflect the politics of ruthlessness

533
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,100
or you are

534
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,400
You also have to give some benefits to your constituency

535
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,960
I also want to give some benefits to my constituency

536
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,500
so i also

537
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,340
Help you to transfer part of the money to your constituency

538
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,680
You also let me define where there are some funding places

539
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,240
Then I don't know where the money will go

540
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,280
What method is used to send it out?

541
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,540
Handicrafts in some places

542
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,140
what road construction

543
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,840
what to do

544
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
Flooding with hand power

545
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
so

546
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,880
So actually two bourgeois parties

547
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,440
it has a reason

548
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,880
Because of the sustained high-speed economic development in the past

549
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,200
because our society moves

550
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,320
The ratings of social mobility are very high

551
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,880
Our education has a strong equalizing effect

552
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,520
This makes your

553
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,560
The structure of this class is highly mobile

554
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,520
It is no longer easy to generate economic awareness

555
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
Your parents may actually be third-level reviewers.

556
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,680
And you have become our lawyer

557
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,000
Where is your class consciousness?

558
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,320
Bayi's incomplete class consciousness

559
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,440
It is an industry dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises

560
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,600
it turned out to be interesting

561
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,440
Because Taiwan is very different from South Korea and Japan

562
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,400
South Korea is big business

563
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,120
Japan can have a dual economy

564
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,880
There are large enterprises and small and medium enterprises

565
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,600
Taiwan is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises

566
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,960
Taiwan's big companies don't look big in the world

567
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Foxconn exception

568
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Therefore, the adverse impact on the development of the labor movement

569
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
SMEs are particularly hostile to trade unions

570
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
However, it is easier for trade unions to mobilize and organize in a large enterprise environment.

571
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
politics of course repress it

572
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
So if we compare it with East Asia

573
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You will find that P class politics in East Asian countries in general are not so obvious

574
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
However, compared with Japan and South Korea, the labor movement in Taiwan is especially compared with South Korea.

575
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
so we the left are absent

576
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
that's not left and right that's what we are

577
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Political parties do not use left-right policies to win votes

578
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Rather, political competition is waged by the mobilization of opposing identities

579
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
what are we looking at now

580
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
how do we see history

581
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
what are we going to do now

582
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
what will the future be

583
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
let's look at history first

584
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
History necessarily involves different times in textbooks

585
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Is it a continental or oceanic view of history?

586
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,640
We think of Taiwan as an extension of the mainland

587
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,640
In other words, Taiwan is a child of the ocean

588
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,620
you are from a continent

589
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,940
Taiwan from Mainland China's point of view

590
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,400
Or regard Taiwan as

591
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,380
yourself as the center

592
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,180
then a marine

593
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,840
Then there's the influence of the ocean

594
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
There is an influence from the mainland

595
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,540
Is it human or land

596
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
You strongly belong to this group

597
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
It is basically the Chinese nation

598
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,500
is from Zhongyuan

599
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,380
is this

600
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,180
still a territory

601
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,680
this is not right

602
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,180
Taiwan is right.

603
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
different people come

604
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:40,920
Right

605
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,380
The Japanese come, the Dutch come, the Chinese come, etc.

606
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,880
but the center of your land

607
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,380
what is wrong with this kind of thing

608
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,180
It depends on what point of view you take

609
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,640
Just your most hyped Rijiu Garden

610
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,380
A real point in the middle of Rijiu Garden

611
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,680
Is it Japanese data?

612
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,320
what does japan mean

613
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,360
It's unreasonable for the Japanese to call you

614
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
don't give him legitimacy

615
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
why not give him legitimacy

616
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
because of this place

617
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It is harmful to the Chinese people and the Chinese people

618
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
so it's not legal for him to come

619
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Turning to this point of view of the Republic of China

620
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
expected

621
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
It can also be said that the rule itself

622
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
have a good meaning

623
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
or at least you can put him

624
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
cleanup

625
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
different times anyway

626
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Some from here, some from there

627
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There are those from the north and those from the west.

628
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
this is the middle period

629
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
value-neutral

630
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
but value neutral

631
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
In fact, all the rulers

632
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
relativized

633
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Because he actually has two different views

634
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What he reflects is the view of continental and oceanic history

635
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Humanism is not the same as territorialism

636
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
now how do we see now

637
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
is to say the official way

638
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
we are a divided country

639
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We claim sovereignty over the other side

640
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Because we are inferior to him

641
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He claims sovereignty over us

642
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
because of lack of power

643
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
not only us

644
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
So now it's a divided country

645
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,900
Is this how you see it?

646
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,900
still one country

647
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
There are two views on one side of the country

648
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,900
one side is

649
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,900
Am I completely unacceptable to the Republic of China?

650
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,400
Another one is

651
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,900
ok i accept for now

652
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,800
Republic of China

653
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,100
But it is the name of Taiwan now

654
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,900
We have no legal relationship with the other side

655
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,100
This Republic of China is Taiwan

656
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,900
what is that?

657
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What are we now?

658
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Different cultural experience also different views

659
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,200
future

660
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Are you going to unify?

661
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,600
Will it continue to maintain the holy school?

662
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,500
Prove Taiwan's independence

663
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,400
Are you in Jianguo?

664
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,100
different people have different opinions

665
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,000
Aren't we a fun place?

666
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We are very basic with these

667
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
for many countries

668
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,800
It's a natural thing to do

669
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
we disagree

670
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Because you agree that nature is different

671
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,340
the identity, if it is the main social divide

672
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,660
The main axis of our political competition is of course different

673
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,740
Since the late 2000s

674
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,600
This is an important point and point of view I want to raise

675
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,920
Because we've been on this identification

676
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,020
argued for a long time

677
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,860
this is almost 20 years old

678
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,500
It is the front half of the inner main picture we just looked at

679
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,080
The main axis of political competition begins to shift, I think it is called paradise shift

680
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,400
It's a paradigm shift

681
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,940
why?

682
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,760
Because economic growth has slowed

683
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,820
Therefore, people's desire for basic life has increased

684
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,640
The era of high growth has entered and will never return

685
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,720
But if it's our age

686
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,020
It was during the period of economic take-off

687
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,260
We may think that Ah Star capital raised

688
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,380
economic growth

689
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,900
is a natural thing

690
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But our time was like this

691
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
this age

692
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
young people from different professions

693
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He doesn't think and feel that way at all.

694
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
my daughter complains to me

695
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
His daughter was alive and well

696
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
i heard he worked hard

697
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I heard how to tell him

698
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
22K right?

699
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and how many years

700
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There is no salary increase at this time

701
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So the situation in that economy is very different

702
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
After the age of identity politics has passed

703
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
everyone is tired

704
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Identifying with something is deep in your heart

705
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
maybe when i was very young

706
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
grown up in the family

707
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Because I keep picking that thing

708
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
it's very uncomfortable

709
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
third

710
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Wait a minute, I want to talk about this

711
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
cross-strait relations

712
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Identity is a bridge between identity and economy

713
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Anyway, there are several main reasons

714
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,800
Axis shift

715
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,820
process first

716
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,380
New social divisions appear to be emerging

717
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,140
the second

718
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,960
The KMT has changed after losing the election

719
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,720
third

720
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,800
The Democratic Progressive Party has also transformed under the pressure of the election

721
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,840
Let's take a closer look

722
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,380
what am i talking about

723
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,440
Let's take a look at the state of the economy

724
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,220
how the economy is doing

725
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,320
The average economic growth rate in the 1990s was 6.93%

726
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,860
Everyone at that time

727
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,160
I saw numbers in the 1990s and felt

728
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,440
not so good

729
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,540
The 1980s were double-digit growth

730
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,080
2000 to 2007

731
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,340
satisfy the ruling

732
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,400
During the period when the governance point was in power

733
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,500
From 2007 to 2008, half of them were in power under the KMT

734
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,560
At that time it was adjusted to 4.43%

735
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,100
KMT slams DPP

736
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,380
total economy

737
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,660
Of course it only goes up and down

738
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,940
it's not average that way

739
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,020
2008 to 2011 or 2012

740
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,580
These data are sometimes 100 million and sometimes 12

741
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,880
adjusted to 3.2%

742
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,900
what do we hear now

743
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,540
Baoer, right?

744
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,500
Poichi

745
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,340
Wenwen grew up in the 1980s

746
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Have you ever heard of such numbers?

747
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,340
but that's how it is now isn't it

748
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,660
Strongly narrate

749
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,160
Strongly narrate

750
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,600
minimum is 0

751
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,700
Maximum is 1

752
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,600
it is coming

753
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,200
measure your income inequality

754
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,800
If it is 0, it is the most equal

755
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,500
If it is 1, it is the most unequal

756
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,800
We see strong narrative

757
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
9.0.317

758
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,800
0.1 to 0.7 years is 0.34

759
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Then continue to grow to 0.343

760
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
this looks

761
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
can't match the feeling

762
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,300
Because it doesn't change much

763
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,800
We see why indexing is good

764
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,300
This is our coefficient for Dabao

765
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,800
Dabao coefficient is generally understood by everyone

766
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,600
It's the one with the highest income

767
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
20%

768
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,300
The ratio between the bottom 2%

769
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
most powerful group

770
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Liqun

771
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
Its income is worse than the original

772
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
how much to add

773
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
good

774
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
1690s is 5.33

775
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
2002 706.03

776
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
2008 to 2011 is 6.19

777
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
keep going up

778
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Compare the above with international

779
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
come and see

780
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
compared to Japan

781
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Already relatively speaking

782
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
is not equal

783
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
South Korea pulls higher than ours

784
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Americanization

785
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Of course it's more scary

786
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
because it is more capitalist

787
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
its large island coefficient

788
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
20

789
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
if singapore

790
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
up to 20

791
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
this number is very large

792
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
but in our case

793
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
is also changing

794
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Unemployment rate 2.043.7

795
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
4.77

796
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Unemployment is constantly increasing

797
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So this graph of the economy

798
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Bottom Natural Member Home

799
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
is the case of an interest rate economy

800
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
so we showed up

801
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
triple phenomenon

802
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
growth decline

803
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
increase in unemployment

804
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Organizational Allocation Deterioration

805
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The triple phenomenon

806
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
foundation eroded

807
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
later for some reason

808
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Including we have no way

809
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Constantly providing new factors of production

810
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
fully employed

811
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Growth-oriented developmentalism is being challenged

812
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Because we can't talk about everything on the spot

813
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
just for economic growth

814
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Too many other factors come into play

815
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
environmental protection

816
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
For example

817
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I seem to be talking recently

818
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
If you want to demolish a house

819
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
under many conditions

820
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to be able to look like this

821
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
For example around here

822
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Is it this ring bottle?

823
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
of course one of them

824
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Is there any other remedy?

825
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
do you have to do this

826
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
if you tear it down

827
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
what might happen

828
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Zhang Jiaofang, right?

829
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
two people died, right?

830
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Then today you're going to demolish the house

831
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
we want to dismantle the government

832
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Everyone is very disgusted

833
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
because you are actually developmentalist

834
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,340
They all regard this thing as a major social loss

835
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,840
In such a situation, it is also like this

836
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,140
tear down the old street

837
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,240
Because of the road, the straight road came out

838
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Then some ice pools gradually appeared, right?

839
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,540
And then came the most amazing ice storage, right?

840
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,540
He's dead against it, isn't he?

841
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,040
Then everyone started to sympathize with him.

842
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,140
unimaginable here before

843
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,740
Of course, the situation in Taiwan is even more like this.

844
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Continuing on independence, there is no way to maintain national security capabilities limited

845
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,980
Or give an example, Li Hongyuan, Minister Li

846
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,480
He just kept talking

847
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,480
You talk now and you can feel it

848
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I know what he means

849
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,480
You don't know, you don't listen to me

850
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,980
Of course, use the stratum to go offline and then flood it.

851
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Giving you 600 billion is not enough

852
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,480
Just impolite and promiscuous, right?

853
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
that's how people are

854
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,480
New year's industrial policy in doubt

855
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,480
In the past, the country wanted to develop

856
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,720
Recently it seems to me

857
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,840
There I saw Zhang Zhongru's impact made by a NHK Japanese

858
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,340
I just wanted to say how did you get here on a ride?

859
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,240
because of industrial policy

860
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,140
It is how to bring a country in the direction of a specific industry

861
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,040
The country is going this way

862
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,440
This situation of continuing to care for is going this way

863
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
see clearly

864
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,840
I know if it's going in any direction

865
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,040
But now the industrial policy in the new field

866
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,380
not so simple situation

867
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,380
biotechnology industry

868
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,520
God, how much are you going to spend in the biotech industry?

869
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,480
How many years to burn money

870
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,980
I asked a relative in America

871
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,020
one of his pharmaceutical factory jobs

872
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,020
From the very beginning to the end of his pharmaceutical factory

873
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,980
he left the drug factory

874
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,220
to develop a drug

875
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,820
he made a lot of money

876
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,980
Their medicine was never developed

877
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
I'm weird I'm thinking

878
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,680
Will you do it alone?

879
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,680
how do you get rich

880
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,080
just pay yours

881
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And how did you get so rich yourself?

882
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
so you have to take a long time

883
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
it is possible to create

884
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This kind of enterprise, the products in this kind of industry

885
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Very difficult

886
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And it is still very controversial

887
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Coupled with neoliberal economic policies in power

888
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
increase the proportion of property income

889
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I want to ask everyone

890
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you or those around you

891
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
How much of your money comes from new

892
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Guys I think all the money you make is from new

893
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
you are definitely not a rich man

894
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
OK really rich people

895
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
his property

896
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
The vast majority are not from new

897
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
what is it from

898
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
his property

899
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
what is his property

900
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
he is buying that house

901
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
He bought and sold the house

902
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
buy again sell

903
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
how much in the middle

904
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
he was in joe valley

905
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
he was in joe valley

906
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,640
He fried a big bone

907
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,240
Someone jumped in and he let go

908
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,600
He said how much he can earn

909
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,460
That's really coming and going

910
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,880
Sell â€‹â€‹it compared to your whole life

911
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,920
The money to be earned will be much more

912
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:18,000
So do we have any restrictions on the housing market now?

913
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,120
we have this market price right?

914
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,560
But we have announcement restrictions

915
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,000
now want to change

916
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,440
But the main force is very big

917
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,920
and then your so-called luxury tax

918
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,920
That is, you bought it and sold it quickly

919
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,040
he deducts tax for you

920
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,800
That's what's been said recently

921
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,400
Why

922
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,880
young people can't stand

923
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,360
Your house is hard to find.

924
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,360
I remember that President Ma used to be like

925
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,640
Did he just come to power or when he actually got elected?

926
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,000
I remember hearing a sentence at that time

927
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,400
i heard very test

928
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,440
He said a bottle of millions is not a dream

929
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
How long will it take the young man to buy it

930
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But of course, it also represents the continuous understanding of funds

931
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
full confidence in this society

932
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So prices keep going up

933
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So under the circumstances of Xinziroom

934
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Ami on this piece of property

935
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
as much as possible

936
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Come here as much as you want

937
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Through the mechanism of the market

938
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Buying and selling machinery wealth

939
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
The same is true for the US

940
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The deteriorating situation of the income of the United States

941
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
compared to Taiwan

942
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
more than anything

943
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
so these will

944
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
neoliberalism is relevant

945
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Quantitative economic performance begins

946
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
fade

947
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Then go to Taiwan

948
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
no class conflict

949
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
a very important reason

950
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It is our continuous high growth

951
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Rapid social mobility and extremely low unemployment

952
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
There is also the distribution of income relative to the military

953
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
In this case

954
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Think about it in this high-speed flow situation

955
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Not easy to generate class consciousness

956
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
right

957
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,960
But looking forward to the future we can't see

958
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,460
Prospects for improving economic conditions

959
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,840
So worries about economic life

960
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,040
Of course it will affect the political considerations of the people

961
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,500
I have no way to grow the past senior

962
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,340
regarded as necessary

963
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,800
So the main axis of political competition in Taiwan

964
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,460
Impossible not to be in this situation

965
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
also affected by some

966
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,300
This is the economic part

967
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Let's talk about a kind of mobilization

968
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,460
the exhaustion

969
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,120
It's been robbed

970
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,620
already tired

971
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
When the public is still accustomed to accepting

972
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,960
When seen as a major social divide

973
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,460
economic factors at that time

974
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,120
still no way to become a voter

975
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,460
I think this is the primary consideration

976
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,620
let me give you an example

977
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,120
in 2001

978
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,760
Taiwan has experienced unprecedented secondary growth

979
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,120
previous oil crises

980
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,380
We don't have secondary growth

981
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,120
Back then it was vice 1.65

982
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,260
Income distribution is deteriorating rapidly

983
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,260
At that time, the Kuomintang jumped out and said

984
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,260
Wow look what the economy is doing

985
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Attacking the Democratic Progressive Party like this

986
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,760
But voters were not affected by this

987
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,560
Basically in 2004 we had a presidential election

988
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,640
March and congressional elections in December

989
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,440
maintain the political status quo

990
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,600
This is really the status of the Democratic Progressive Party

991
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,880
Nor was it affected by today's performance

992
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,400
why is this very important

993
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,520
Because Taiwan's economy has been growing rapidly in the past

994
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,680
At that time there was an unprecedented major crisis

995
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,120
But the common people have no rules and the ruling party

996
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,720
In the era of Ah Bian

997
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,040
Almost Every Election Becomes a Consensus Choice

998
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,920
Even when the Democratic Progressive Party's election situation began to decline in 2005

999
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,280
President Chen still insists on confronting the KMT on the issues he agrees with

1000
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,480
Let's take a look at the main picture in the previous paragraph

1001
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,640
Too much of this event revolves around periods of identification

1002
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,520
It was the big thing at that time

1003
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,520
Now we talk about the big trend and the big wrong has its special meaning

1004
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,080
right

1005
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,280
But at that time the tide

1006
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,500
astaffy is there

1007
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,960
There are two levels of antagonism in society

1008
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,160
Of course many people think

1009
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,360
this time can't stand

1010
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,760
can you stop doing this

1011
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,000
And cross-strait relations

1012
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,360
And the relationship between Taiwan and the United States

1013
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,840
also under tension

1014
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,260
of course it looks like this

1015
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,460
So recognize the cost of mobilization

1016
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,760
looks full height

1017
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,200
Okay, I'm going to talk about the third factor now.

1018
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,160
Cause our axis may transform

1019
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,960
On the one hand you care about the economy

1020
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,760
I think this is the most important thing

1021
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:33,860
On the other hand, I agree that there are too many mobilizations

1022
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,620
also feel tired

1023
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,700
Between these two there is actually one more

1024
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,260
This link is cross-strait relations

1025
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,800
This was in 2008

1026
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,660
A Logical Deduction of the KMT

1027
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,800
how does it say

1028
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,200
Taiwan's economy is slowing down

1029
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,160
Distribution becomes an important issue

1030
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,920
At that time, I was talking all day long

1031
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,260
How many people died by burning charcoal

1032
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,420
how many people committed suicide or what

1033
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,620
Now the DPP is saying the same thing about the KMT

1034
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,620
But it was the KMT who started talking about it

1035
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Let's just say the economy is getting worse.

1036
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Everyone feels that it is

1037
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
An important reason for Taiwan's economic growth

1038
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
is tense to cross-strait relations

1039
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Because the relationship between the two sides was really tense at that time.

1040
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Is investment can not improve

1041
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
if you want to invest

1042
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Will you put the money on the missile

1043
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
over there

1044
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Or the side where the missiles are going to go down?

1045
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So Shanghai has a lot of investment

1046
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But you want to invest in Taiwan

1047
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Wealthy people ask for money

1048
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Of course I want a political stability

1049
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
One kind of public opinion is yellow hole

1050
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
so you want to improve the economy

1051
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You need to improve cross-strait relations

1052
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I can't fight that bowl like it's going to war

1053
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
To improve cross-strait relations

1054
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
From your external standpoint

1055
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
A certain form of One China must come out

1056
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
it's a hollow thought

1057
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
how is a

1058
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We have said in the past they can accept

1059
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
so

1060
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
If you want something like this

1061
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
The so-called Chinese things come out

1062
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Nature can't be very strong

1063
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
anthropogenic awareness

1064
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
For example, you can't

1065
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
On the one hand there is on the other hand too much to see

1066
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So the 1992 Consensus reappeared

1067
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
The 1992 Consensus is a term that Su Qi came up with

1068
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
In fact, there was no such term before

1069
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So Lee Teng-hui scolded him

1070
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
i want to die

1071
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Everyone is serious, in fact, he thinks

1072
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
he is right

1073
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But he did come down to it

1074
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
A so-called consensus at that time

1075
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
What consensus? It's actually very simple

1076
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
On one side is the People's Republic of China

1077
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
On one side is the Republic of China

1078
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
the republic of china says

1079
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
no republic of china

1080
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The mainland belongs to the Republic of China

1081
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The People's Republic of China does not have the Republic of China

1082
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It has also become the 26th or 27th century

1083
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
is it? ok

1084
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
That Taiwan belongs to China

1085
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Both the south side and the north side stand

1086
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
How do you come up with something in common?

1087
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
is what we think of in common

1088
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
what have in common

1089
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Everyone thinks I only have one China

1090
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
so

1091
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
that's right

1092
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
in this case

1093
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The 1992 consensus cannot be stopped

1094
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But this horse is also interesting

1095
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
He was actually in the 1980s

1096
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
out that time

1097
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
He's in Luyouhui

1098
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,280
he imagined

1099
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Good God, I always figured it out at that time

1100
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,780
There is this so-called 9 case

1101
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,280
At that time, it was not called Case 9.

1102
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,280
Consensus submission of each table

1103
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,280
come out and write his name

1104
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,640
one table

1105
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,400
That's how I thought about it at that time

1106
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,680
But time has changed so long

1107
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,940
By the year 2000

1108
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,780
Taiwanese society is no longer the same

1109
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,280
you speak a variety of words

1110
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,580
Some people may not accept

1111
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,580
so he said

1112
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
This consensus in 1992

1113
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,820
one table

1114
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,820
Let's call it the 9-case consensus

1115
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,920
Then what

1116
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,420
I talk about the consensus of 9 cases

1117
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,020
What about the mainland?

1118
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,320
I talk about the consensus of 9 cases

1119
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,320
As long as there is a consensus on the 9 cases, there will be no war

1120
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,820
As long as you talk about the consensus of 9 cases, you can have investment

1121
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,220
Just talk about the consensus of 9 cases

1122
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,420
the economy will get better

1123
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,420
He just said yes

1124
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,920
just say yes

1125
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,920
Because the 9-case consensus did not say

1126
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
This is one table

1127
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,420
Because people in Taiwan listen to the mainland a lot

1128
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,260
He has a natural resentment

1129
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,540
Just jump up when you hear one

1130
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,340
But what if you say

1131
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,140
The One China we talk about is the 1992 Consensus

1132
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,960
Then as long as you hear that one in two is talking about the 1992 Consensus

1133
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:09,980
The 1992 consensus is so good

1134
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,520
when you feel good

1135
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,820
President Ma said that when

1136
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,880
Dr. Ma Presidential Candidate Says Again

1137
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,660
my eyes are ready

1138
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,940
Do you remember the galloping horse

1139
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,000
Every county magistrate comes out and says it's ready

1140
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,520
Ready

1141
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,580
make a big impact

1142
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,900
At that time, the DPP had a lot of corruption, what?

1143
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,980
Ah Bian, the people below are going to gamble again.

1144
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,760
His wife is counting that again

1145
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,320
what is this receipt

1146
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,140
therefore

1147
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,480
In order to revitalize Taiwan's economy, we must stop agreeing with the mobilization

1148
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,740
Then

1149
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,820
Economic recovery and identity are upside down

1150
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,140
If you want to do a good job in the economy, you should stop doing that thing.

1151
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,680
And in Taiwan at that time

1152
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,960
is audible

1153
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,800
So the economic power of the electorate demands to be acquainted with the initiative for Taiwan's indigenous identity

1154
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,340
But let's not talk about this yet

1155
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,080
The economy is so bad right now

1156
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
that's better

1157
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Such logic can gain the support of many voters

1158
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Overall economic downturn

1159
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
identification mobilization boredom

1160
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The cross-strait relations I just talked about

1161
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
The link between identity and economics

1162
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
One is that we are worried when the economy goes down

1163
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
One is that we can't stand the identification for too long

1164
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
One is that I want to boost the economy

1165
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It is necessary to improve cross-strait relations

1166
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
improve cross-strait relations

1167
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
to accept a certain degree of one-China principle

1168
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
To do so, one must accept the 1992 Consensus

1169
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And you are going to talk about the 1992 Consensus

1170
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Of course you can't be high

1171
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
your Taiwan independence identity

1172
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
so there is an instrumental link between the two

1173
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
These three factors combined

1174
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You will find that the axis starts to shift

1175
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
First the KMT then the DPP

1176
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
from our point of view

1177
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
When the KMT does this

1178
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
In fact, it has also gone through a process

1179
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
In the mid-1990s the concept of China

1180
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,920
increasingly politicized

1181
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,920
And it became specific to mainland China

1182
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,960
I used to grow up in our time

1183
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,320
it doesn't feel like that

1184
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,000
But it's getting more and more like this

1185
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,600
So Chinese identity in Taiwan

1186
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,520
gradually dissolve

1187
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,760
Chinese nationalism

1188
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,000
it seems untenable

1189
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,760
The Democratic Progressive Party in this era of identity change

1190
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,720
Rise into great political gain

1191
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,600
But the KMT retreated all the way

1192
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,040
and it gradually takes a

1193
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,120
Vague and Fluid Position

1194
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,000
how does it say

1195
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
it first declares itself

1196
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,120
Even if China is Taiwan

1197
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,200
So come up with it and call it

1198
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,720
Republic of China in Taiwan

1199
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,000
both have

1200
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,400
And gradually increase the proportion of the second identity

1201
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,920
accent on the second scale

1202
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,440
When the Kuomintang was in the presidential university in 2000

1203
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,600
After Lee Teng-hui was defeated and transferred to the green camp

1204
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,640
The traditional position of the Kuomintang

1205
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,800
Looks like there's no way to maintain

1206
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,160
At least those in the KMT

1207
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,200
think so

1208
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,760
So the KMT

1209
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,920
fall into opposition position

1210
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,280
he lost the first time

1211
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,080
he is thinking

1212
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Of course less talk about recognition

1213
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Now the government is the Democratic Progressive Party

1214
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
while the Democratic Progressive Party

1215
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The economy has deteriorated

1216
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Of course, they desperately attacked the Democratic Progressive Party.

1217
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
There is no way to properly handle Taiwan's economic crisis

1218
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
His transformation was natural

1219
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
The KMT began to enter by identifying with

1220
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
transition to economy

1221
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
1990 2,000

1222
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
In 2005, after entering and leaving the chairman of the Kuomintang party

1223
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
He began to downplay the identity controversy

1224
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
what did he say

1225
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
He said drug evasion was a legal option

1226
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
KMT on February 14, 2006

1227
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
published in the Liberty Times

1228
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Advertising in the age of modernization

1229
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
he said so

1230
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
He keeps talking about political unity

1231
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I said Ah Bian scolded me to death, right?

1232
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
next time

1233
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
He never talked about it again

1234
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Automatically unification

1235
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
so

1236
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Made strategy ahead of presidential election

1237
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
take a step back

1238
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Then act for the Democratic Progressive Party

1239
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
stop talking about this

1240
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
thank you all

1241
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that's the ad

1242
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
liberty times

1243
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,240
In February 2000, the interesting thing is that these Liberty Times lamps

1244
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,240
how on earth is this written

1245
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,040
The Chinese Nationalist Party advocates competition in the spirit of democracy

1246
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,640
Taiwan has many possible options for the future

1247
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,840
Whether it is the same independence or the maintenance of the status quo

1248
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,440
must be decided by the people

1249
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,340
The Kuomintang's claim

1250
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,440
say you want to ask me

1251
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,840
Although all three

1252
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,840
you ask me

1253
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,040
Taiwan should maintain the status quo of the ROC

1254
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,680
Circle it like this, right?

1255
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,000
but one thing to note

1256
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,200
How about his whole discourse?

1257
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,680
to transform the Republic of China from a supreme constitutional and moral obligation

1258
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,000
This used to be in this part of the KMT

1259
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
there is no need to discuss

1260
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,680
It has become a political proposition chosen by the public voters

1261
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,380
it makes a big difference

1262
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,600
It used to say you had to be loyal to the constitution

1263
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,240
than traditionally there is such a legitimacy

1264
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,040
With this tradition is the Republic of China

1265
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,300
The founding father of the Republic of China cannot be relied on

1266
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,860
what are you talking about

1267
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,160
So call Han the Republic of China

1268
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,220
What is Ma Britain's law now?

1269
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,260
Oh, you talk about independence

1270
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,060
Someone said unity

1271
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,600
In fact, he didn't say that before, he didn't say that

1272
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,900
Some people say that maintaining the status quo is me

1273
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,720
Then he does a poll and finds that the status quo is the most

1274
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,760
That means I'm arguing for the status quo

1275
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,060
I don't object to you either. What about your method?

1276
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,080
also has his reason

1277
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,400
It's okay if everyone likes him

1278
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,680
But mine is better

1279
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,040
He turns himself into an option, a commodity in the middle of the political market

1280
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,600
Let everyone be free to decide

1281
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,400
Rather than saying that under the norms of the law

1282
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,700
must

1283
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,020
The moral, obligatory, supreme thing

1284
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,300
I used to look at it like this

1285
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,880
So in the process the horse has turned

1286
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,760
Since 2006

1287
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,560
KMT Freezes Identity Controversy

1288
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,580
emphasize

1289
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,120
economic importance

1290
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,120
Then to ease cross-strait relations

1291
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,320
That's why Xiao Wanqiang's cross-strait common market emerged.

1292
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,820
The 1992 Consensus with Su Qi became the main axis of the campaign

1293
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:07,820
Cross-strait relations are understood in terms of economic interests

1294
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,320
Utilize civil for economical transactions

1295
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,420
Improve relations between the Kuomintang and the other side

1296
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,920
provide a basis for public opinion

1297
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,760
In the KMT election campaign

1298
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,520
economy is the main purpose

1299
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,600
Cross-strait relations are tools for promotion

1300
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,860
Freezing identity disputes is a necessary means to improve cross-strait relations

1301
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,560
Such a logical layout

1302
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,560
It hasn't changed until today

1303
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,360
so it's realistic

1304
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,960
instrumental discourse

1305
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,760
Quite different from the claims of instrumental ideology

1306
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,760
The Democratic Party is totally different

1307
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,260
KMT challenge Naro Narok refuses to give up at first

1308
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,060
Looks like a strong battlefield

1309
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,260
Still put forward various proposals on the identity

1310
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,460
I remember that time

1311
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:55,760
Even the electricity bill supports IoT

1312
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,060
put a lot of things on it

1313
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,300
Roll the head into the face, the body is fresh, etc.

1314
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,600
So you found a very interesting thing today

1315
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,600
What about blue and green? Blue fights blue, not green fights green.

1316
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,520
The blue is not the green is talking about the classics

1317
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,600
Green always speaks, agrees, agrees, agrees

1318
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,200
So the competition between these two becomes

1319
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,200
It's not just a competition between blue and green

1320
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,000
It's a competition between two different issues

1321
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,800
In 2008, of course, there were various factors

1322
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,400
but no matter

1323
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,600
The two generations of Mingyue, the Congress and their classmates, will lose in both

1324
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,000
This number is very large compared with before

1325
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
The numbers fifteen percent and seventeen percent

1326
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,000
Then tomorrow, the review will start.

1327
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,800
Then in his mind, in fact, Tsai Ing-wen

1328
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,200
Tsai Ing-wen is not the leader of any faction

1329
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,300
Tsai Ing-wen, our understanding is basically

1330
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,800
Lee Teng-hui suggested to Chen Shui-bian

1331
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,700
And he just happens not to be from any faction

1332
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,300
So he became the new chairman of the party

1333
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,800
under his agency to begin the transformation

1334
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,400
So the transformation of the Kuomintang and the transformation of the DPP

1335
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,200
all because

1336
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,760
Because of electing the DPP after 2008

1337
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,500
Editorial Benefits of Any Same Momentum

1338
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,700
Doesn't it look tall?

1339
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,400
That just so happens that he's in the opposition now.

1340
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,700
The KMT is the ruling party

1341
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,600
So the KMT's economic performance is very convenient

1342
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,800
To evaluate the target, APPFIRE, house price,

1343
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,300
The unemployed under this huge height

1344
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,800
In fact, the government at the time of the 2012 case

1345
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,300
I want to give this young man who has just come out of work

1346
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:34,400
a concession

1347
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,300
Pay attention to the lights

1348
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,300
he gave him 2012

1349
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,900
Because you probably didn't have a job at all.

1350
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,700
So the government pays some money

1351
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,700
Then these companies will use 22K

1352
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,700
Then look after this young man

1353
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,000
As everyone knows, more companies are on the same page

1354
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,300
So your original 24K also jump to 22K

1355
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,600
so i complained so much

1356
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,600
policies like this

1357
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,100
Of course there are places to attack

1358
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,600
so in a sense

1359
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,320
Tsai Ing-wen took the route of Ma Ying-jeou

1360
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,160
how to say

1361
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,920
In his mind, he leaned towards the middle

1362
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,080
Let's think about Tsai Ing-wen

1363
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,160
We'll have a picture of him in our minds.

1364
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,320
his speech

1365
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,120
Then think about Chen Shui-bian

1366
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
then he looks like

1367
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,720
his speech

1368
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,600
can you feel it

1369
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,200
The two of them seem to be from different planets

1370
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,800
very big difference

1371
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,440
he is alone

1372
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,280
year before running for president

1373
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,160
This sentence was spoken on the Double Tenth National Day in 2011

1374
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,120
The Republic of China is Taiwan

1375
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,120
But the meaning of this is actually what the Democratic Progressive Party has said

1376
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,760
But what he means by this is

1377
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,680
you do not need to worry

1378
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,640
if i come up

1379
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,200
I will not take away the four characters of the Republic of China

1380
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,360
Many people for the Republic of China

1381
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,960
is a note with a strong emotion

1382
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,240
It means to go in the middle

1383
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,240
realistic

1384
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,800
His objection to APP

1385
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,400
A realistic economic standpoint

1386
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,960
I remember that there are many advertisements of the Democratic Progressive Party

1387
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,200
like chamon et al

1388
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,540
that is

1389
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,840
If that EKFA comes

1390
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,880
their livelihoods are affected

1391
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,480
he does not use ideological methods

1392
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,340
come against him

1393
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:14,440
what he said was very realistic

1394
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,180
Tsai Ying-ming wants to organize Taiwan independence

1395
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,280
Cai Yingming has a group Zhang Gong to join the alliance

1396
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,680
Cai Yingming has a group certificate

1397
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,640
Tsai Ying-ming organized Zhang to make a constitution

1398
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,240
These group sheets from the A-bian era

1399
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,200
Cai does not speak at all

1400
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:34,080
Therefore, the Democratic Progressive Party has gradually shifted from political to economic

1401
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,440
Also Freeze Policy

1402
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,040
Economy hangs over overall median voter appointments

1403
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,480
but please when you go like this

1404
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,200
when you walk like this

1405
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,200
What do you say about your life voters

1406
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,240
don't be afraid

1407
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,040
He has no one but you to vote for

1408
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,740
Which one do you ask him to vote for?

1409
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,340
In Namadang History Network, a Relying on People Versus Producing Voters

1410
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,040
also the same

1411
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,480
so

1412
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,000
This is the KMT's 2008 set of strategies

1413
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,540
Two middle walks happened

1414
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,620
result

1415
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,120
We have seen the DPP win for a decade

1416
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,940
A series of by-elections whose support is now picking up

1417
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:07,200
In the 5th election in 2010, the total number of votes exceeded the KMT

1418
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,220
5% if you add up the county and city elections in the previous year

1419
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,860
You will find that the DPP has more votes than the KMT

1420
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,500
Although the DPP did not win back power in 2012

1421
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,800
But has significantly reduced the gap between the KMT

1422
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,460
Congress is from 15 to 10 presidents, and from 17% to 6%

1423
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,700
i remember before that presidential election

1424
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,000
There are many predictions that Tsai Ing-wen may win

1425
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
let you think about the situation at that time

1426
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:41,000
Then she campaigned with her personal image, and her demands are far from the candidates of the Democratic Progressive Party in the past.

1427
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
But some people like to hear it so much

1428
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,100
But in fact she is quite similar to Ma Ying-jeou

1429
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:47,800
isn't it

1430
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Received this education abroad

1431
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,900
She can't even speak Taiwanese correctly.

1432
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,800
her english is very good

1433
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,800
It's cold when she talks

1434
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,200
not easy to explain

1435
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
man ji ang this

1436
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
that stirs up

1437
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I remember the night before the election

1438
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
You go back and bless him

1439
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
But when he's most emotional

1440
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
It seems that you keep Taiwan's secrets

1441
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Give Tsai Ing-wen

1442
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That person changed and said your action

1443
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
not cai herself

1444
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Tsai Ing-wen is not that kind of horse

1445
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Ji Ang's that can agitate

1446
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
this

1447
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
just when you were there

1448
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Hello everyone

1449
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
call it this way

1450
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Then there are some gestures

1451
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It feels like there is no way to be brought up by him.

1452
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
These two are actually

1453
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
in the colder

1454
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
such a presidential candidate

1455
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
the leader

1456
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
so interesting

1457
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So we see that the KMT and the DPP

1458
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
learn from each other

1459
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And learn from the lessons of defeat

1460
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
KMT downplays his Chinese nationalism

1461
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
adopt a hybrid identity

1462
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
then turn to economics

1463
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,600
Any mobilization and acceptance of economic

1464
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,800
as the main topic

1465
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,200
Both parties learn from defeat

1466
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,200
magan vegetables to a considerable extent

1467
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,100
converted their political parties

1468
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,100
However, we have to ask the transformation

1469
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,400
Is it decisive

1470
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
And what might happen in the future

1471
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,700
then continue to look down

1472
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:20,200
there are three words

1473
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,100
One is replacement

1474
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,200
one is crisscrossing

1475
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,400
one is facade

1476
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,200
That replacement is to replace

1477
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,800
Is it possible for the economy to actually replace

1478
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,900
Has identity become the main axis of political competition in Taiwan?

1479
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,700
if it is like this

1480
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,200
is to identify the relevant issues

1481
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,900
no longer the main axis

1482
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:39,300
The economy becomes the core issue

1483
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,500
Here I have three

1484
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,700
This shade of development

1485
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,600
One is the economic vote

1486
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,500
economic vote

1487
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,100
Those who engage in economic voting are small

1488
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,300
There are some fine distinctions in it

1489
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,600
Forward-looking is his retrospective is his society is his personal

1490
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,300
basically means

1491
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,600
Are you looking at the present or the future?

1492
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,200
Or you look at your pocket

1493
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,400
Or look at the whole society

1494
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,600
Anyway, he just depends on the overall economic situation to decide.

1495
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,640
is it how to vote

1496
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,440
completely determined by the economy

1497
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,000
The second one I call distributive politics

1498
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,840
That is to say, the two parties

1499
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,640
It will combine with various interest groups

1500
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,840
When you vote, it depends on which interest group you belong to

1501
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,640
Which party to vote for

1502
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,000
As is often the case in the United States,

1503
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,160
In Europe it is often the case that

1504
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,760
class vote

1505
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,760
Then I'd say I'm a Labor family

1506
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,360
I have always been a laborer

1507
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,560
Then I have been a laborer for many generations

1508
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,760
and then myself

1509
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,960
So I'm full of this class history

1510
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,160
Then I will definitely work

1511
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,160
no problem anyway

1512
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,960
no matter what

1513
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,160
It's all a form of substituting economics for identity

1514
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,660
We found that if we do

1515
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,160
then social divisions are unprecedented

1516
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,500
turned the matter

1517
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:07,000
KMT may transform into a center-right party

1518
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,200
The DPP may become a center-left party

1519
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,300
if he doesn't

1520
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,500
may have to this class

1521
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,800
Left and right oriented parties will replace them

1522
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,300
Normalization of Taiwan politics

1523
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,300
We take left and right as the main axis of competition

1524
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,900
looks like western

1525
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,900
but of course

1526
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,900
Of course, it is impossible to completely eliminate the love house that I agree with.

1527
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,900
It is difficult to hide the factors of mainland China

1528
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,900
who knows what will happen to them

1529
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:38,900
so of course we know

1530
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,900
This identity politics is likely to be faked again

1531
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:44,900
Basically, as long as there is no that, it will slowly replace

1532
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,900
this is the first possibility

1533
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,900
The second possibility is that the appearance is a FaÃ§ade

1534
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,900
What does that mean

1535
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:56,900
The economy is just a mask for deep identities

1536
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,900
Economists on both sides of the strait supported by the Kuomintang and the Kuomintang

1537
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,560
Not because they want to revive Taiwan's economy

1538
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,400
But because it still has a unified love house inside

1539
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,200
DPP opposes cross-strait economic integration

1540
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,480
Not because of any economic and practical factors

1541
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,480
It is because its deep concept is to legalize Taiwan independence.

1542
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,640
So it is the enemy division for mainland China

1543
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,440
The economic language and rational thinking used by both sides

1544
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,080
It's all fake appearances

1545
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,760
truly influential

1546
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,960
It is the deep recognition of the two parties and the two camps

1547
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,480
copy the language of the economy

1548
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,400
identity

1549
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,920
Sensibility actually surpasses rationality

1550
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,920
is that so

1551
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,520
if legal

1552
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,880
not only political parties hypocrisy

1553
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,280
voters are hypocritical

1554
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,520
Voters seem to accept rational economic discourse

1555
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,840
In fact it accepts a bipartisan message

1556
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,880
emotion of identification

1557
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,400
if it's not about you talking

1558
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
How much

1559
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,200
How many percentage points does the unemployment rate increase?

1560
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,800
I hear what you think makes sense or doesn't make sense

1561
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,200
not by the soundness of your economic argument

1562
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,200
to decide

1563
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,700
but your statement

1564
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,900
Identify with the one hidden deep within me

1565
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,300
Can it be hooked together?

1566
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,700
If I think I can hook it up

1567
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,300
if i were blue i would say

1568
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,200
then i listen to you

1569
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,800
The mainland has good development opportunities

1570
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,520
why i go

1571
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,700
makes sense

1572
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,200
If it's beneficial, I'll think of it

1573
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:24,900
Oh no

1574
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:25,800
Taiwan is doomed

1575
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,900
The service industry is dying

1576
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:29,100
All the electricity will go down like this

1577
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:33,300
In fact, it is your modification that is hooked up

1578
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,700
Economic Issues Are Only Identity Issues

1579
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,800
derivation of issues

1580
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,600
It has no way of determining the voting behavior of voters by itself

1581
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,800
The main axis of Taiwan's politics is to identify with

1582
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,300
The main social divide is still material

1583
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,000
inner identity

1584
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,700
decide what party it is

1585
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,700
The economy is used to rationalize the given choices of the electorate

1586
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,600
This is the FaÃ§ade

1587
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,500
This is the FaÃ§ade

1588
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,900
These three are named Chris Crossley Joe Chan

1589
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,200
Could the truth be between the facade

1590
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,000
It's between Fa Sa's and Replacement

1591
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,500
Will it be economical and acceptable?

1592
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:10,500
They are the two axes of competition

1593
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,000
And they also cross-penetrate

1594
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
In terms of identity, let's say we talk about

1595
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,800
Exclusive Taiwanese

1596
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,800
Exclusively Taiwan's trick

1597
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,400
I am Taiwanese and nothing else

1598
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,500
Taiwanese are also Chinese

1599
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,000
Now if we only talk about Chinese

1600
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,500
already reached the digits

1601
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,700
Many with Chinese identity are in

1602
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,200
Taiwanese and Chinese

1603
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,200
We call him Tc and the one before that is ET

1604
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,700
Then what about the economy

1605
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,700
Left with redistribution and right with focus field

1606
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,700
what am i talking about

1607
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:39,700
That is, you can actually have these four combinations.

1608
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,700
Then what

1609
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,200
Different regions, groups of people, one field

1610
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,700
The relative salience of identity and economy

1611
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,700
It's Ratacus salient

1612
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,200
and still different

1613
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,700
this may be a comparison

1614
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,200
with a detailed view

1615
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,200
ok let's see now

1616
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,200
Echphal means

1617
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:09,000
assuming that economics is a more important consideration than identity

1618
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
then let's see

1619
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
If you identify yourself as Taiwanese

1620
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
How much intimacy with the other side

1621
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Then your economic attitude is right

1622
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Do you feel more connected

1623
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
a little more contact

1624
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
A little more is good for the overall economy

1625
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
if you have both

1626
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
You are the pool of congenital

1627
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
good

1628
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
That

1629
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
If we now assume that economic considerations outweigh recognition

1630
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So if you are in the lower right corner

1631
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The lower right corner means

1632
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
you may or may not be

1633
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Suppose there is such a person

1634
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
For example, he is Japanese

1635
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
He opened a factory, or after the cross-strait communication

1636
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,440
it is beneficial to him

1637
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,600
He's in shipping etc.

1638
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,840
then he is on the right

1639
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,040
But his identification is very strong

1640
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,480
He is Taiwanese

1641
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,880
So the other side has a completely different democracy from mine

1642
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,600
then you will get an attitude

1643
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,680
If you say that your economy is greater than your recognition

1644
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,840
these people will barely support

1645
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,000
Why

1646
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,240
Because the economy is more important

1647
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:32,040
good

1648
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,840
if you are on the left

1649
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,240
Let's say you're the husband

1650
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,840
you can't move

1651
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,040
It's not like money can go to the other side

1652
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,640
Then you may be in a traditional industry

1653
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,040
You are afraid of competition from the other side

1654
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,040
Then what if your identity is

1655
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,040
not Taiwanese

1656
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,240
I don't accept what you said

1657
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,440
We are all Chinese

1658
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,640
what not what to do is chinese

1659
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,040
Anyway, I heard the word Chinese

1660
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,640
i can't accept it

1661
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,040
what if that's the case

1662
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,040
then you just

1663
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,960
it's hardcore green

1664
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,840
you object

1665
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,080
Heaven is against this thing

1666
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,740
But we feel more favorable

1667
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,120
because you are here

1668
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,840
If your golden status is on the left

1669
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,400
But any of you

1670
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,520
I feel that the other side is approachable

1671
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,680
so what attitude do you take

1672
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,280
If we assume that economic ratios identify

1673
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,480
come more important words

1674
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,880
then you will hesitate to object

1675
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:26,880
you still object

1676
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,320
Why

1677
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,480
because you preoccupied the class position

1678
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,880
but you are hesitant to object

1679
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,400
why

1680
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,760
Because the other side tells you

1681
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,000
still kind

1682
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,480
So there is such a situation

1683
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,640
ok let's go down

1684
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,440
will make it clearer

1685
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,120
Well now it's time for the whole

1686
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,120
This is the last paragraph

1687
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,960
as if we were to see

1688
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,600
There may be an axis

1689
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,600
If this turns

1690
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,680
how do we do this research

1691
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,800
First

1692
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,040
we should know

1693
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,960
political party

1694
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,600
What is perception and countermeasures

1695
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,080
picture

1696
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
we just made this

1697
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
The other is to look at voters

1698
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,440
as far as voters are concerned

1699
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,800
identity and economy

1700
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,840
relative salience is what

1701
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:13,080
Is it a replacement, a performance, or a crossover?

1702
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,400
if it is replaced

1703
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,440
That is, if everyone thinks

1704
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,000
economics is more important

1705
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,680
Approval is not that important

1706
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,800
Then I voted for this line

1707
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:25,640
will emerge along this axis of the economy

1708
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,200
beyond identity

1709
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,400
That is to say, if I am left

1710
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,200
i will vote

1711
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,320
Let us suppose

1712
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,200
That is to say, if the DPP moves to the left

1713
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:34,880
to develop words

1714
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,600
I'll vote to the left

1715
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,600
If I am right

1716
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,680
I vote on the right side

1717
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,240
what is my own identity

1718
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,680
this is not important

1719
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,840
If it is appearance

1720
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,240
that is to say it is fake

1721
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,320
everyone basically knows

1722
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:48,800
Vote with your own approval

1723
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,440
Then I voted this way

1724
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:53,080
will emerge along the axis of that identity

1725
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,240
which length makes me feel

1726
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,280
His identity is the same as mine

1727
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,080
I will vote for him

1728
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,120
Whether the party is left or right

1729
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
what if it's a cross

1730
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
My voting line would be somewhere in between

1731
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
i will become a slash

1732
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
well what exactly

1733
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
if we make it

1734
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
as long as we vote all

1735
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
The vote of the Kuomintang

1736
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
put it in

1737
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
In this diagram of identity and economy

1738
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
mark it up

1739
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Then if we see the situation

1740
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Those who voted for the Kuomintang and the blue

1741
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
it's on the top piece

1742
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
who voted for the Democratic Progressive Party

1743
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
it's in the block below

1744
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
we can find out

1745
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
In fact voters

1746
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
The emphasis is on recognition

1747
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Why

1748
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
because it doesn't matter if you're left or right

1749
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
How do I know if you are left or right?

1750
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
May ask by survey

1751
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Then wait and see how your left attitude is

1752
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
so i know if you're left or right

1753
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
whether you are left or right

1754
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,340
As long as I consider myself Taiwanese

1755
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,340
I will vote green

1756
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:08,000
As long as I feel that I am identifying with Taiwanese

1757
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,340
Chinese again

1758
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,640
i will vote blue

1759
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,140
Regardless of my own preference of being left versus right

1760
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,540
that's my vote

1761
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,340
But I mean another word

1762
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,140
like this key

1763
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,940
Still agree with this axis

1764
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,640
This axis divides the two kinds of people

1765
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,740
This axis also splits two kinds of votes

1766
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,580
You vote with your approval

1767
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,280
So something like this

1768
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,580
we're talking a lot of stuff now

1769
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:34,980
In fact, Ai is all fake

1770
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,980
when i voted down

1771
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:40,240
I am voting according to my sensibility

1772
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:45,340
But if we make this picture and change it like this

1773
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,580
how is that

1774
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:50,280
That means I agree with people on the right

1775
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,280
Whether it's my golden status

1776
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,080
Or my opinion of where the country is in this economy

1777
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,780
Policies, etc.

1778
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,580
I am on the right

1779
01:10:58,580 --> 01:10:59,480
I am right

1780
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,080
then no matter

1781
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I said I am Taiwanese

1782
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Or I am both Taiwanese and Chinese

1783
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,500
no matter what my identity is

1784
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,000
i vote like this

1785
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,500
then if i was left

1786
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,500
Just my golden one

1787
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Or I think the government should reduce the gap between rich and poor

1788
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,500
The government should increase welfare spending

1789
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
The government should tax some people more

1790
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,000
It's like I'm the one who thinks so

1791
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
my kind of person

1792
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,500
It doesn't matter if I say I'm Taiwanese

1793
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,500
Taiwanese or Chinese

1794
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,500
No matter what my identity is

1795
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,500
I always vote green and vote for the Democratic Progressive Party.

1796
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,000
Then I found out the results of the poll

1797
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
This line is like this

1798
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
This line just cuts between the left and right

1799
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Same as left and right cut

1800
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So when I voted

1801
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,500
regardless of my approval

1802
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,000
I vote based on my financial interests

1803
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
This word is to replace

1804
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But if what we get is this

1805
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,000
i'm not messing with amoebas

1806
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Although they look a bit like

1807
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
If we look at something like this

1808
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
that's a cross

1809
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
what happens when you cross

1810
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,500
let's watch this

1811
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,460
who is this

1812
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,460
it's economic you're on the right

1813
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:06,960
ok

1814
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,460
Then you should vote blue

1815
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:11,860
But what about agreeing?

1816
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,160
you are guard taiwanese

1817
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,860
But you still voted blue

1818
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,900
said for them

1819
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,960
economy over identity

1820
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,800
so there will be

1821
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,260
Such a piece of blue voter

1822
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,560
that's also in the lower right corner

1823
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:29,860
also the same

1824
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,960
These people should be economically right-wingers

1825
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,460
But in terms of identity, he is Taiwanese.

1826
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,100
He voted green

1827
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,600
What about these people?

1828
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,560
His reason is more important than

1829
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,160
He is more emotional than rational

1830
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,160
He is voting with approval

1831
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,760
if we appear

1832
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,460
Then these two pieces are explained like this

1833
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,200
What about this piece?

1834
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,060
it's just the opposite

1835
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:52,100
he's in the upper left corner

1836
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,060
how do you say this

1837
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,860
That is to say, economically, he is on the left

1838
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:55,760
he should throw left

1839
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,060
So he should vote green

1840
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,260
but

1841
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,120
His identity is Chinese

1842
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,760
Also Taiwanese, he should have voted blue

1843
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,600
He should vote blue emotionally

1844
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,840
His economy should be voted green

1845
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,200
if he casts blue

1846
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:07,480
mean what

1847
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,740
It means he is more emotional than you

1848
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,740
If this piece appears

1849
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:13,500
what is this piece

1850
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,400
also the same

1851
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,080
what is it

1852
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,300
It is left on the golden position

1853
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,000
OK

1854
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:18,800
but

1855
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,500
His identity above

1856
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,000
Is the Chinese also this Taiwanese?

1857
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,580
He voted green

1858
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:27,800
what does that mean

1859
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,800
express his economic considerations

1860
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,400
beyond his approval of the above considerations

1861
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,200
Just if the two things are interpenetrating

1862
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:40,500
Then the axis we see is not like this

1863
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,800
if that is recognition

1864
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,500
not so

1865
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,600
If so, it is economical but

1866
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,700
so

1867
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,000
Such words mean

1868
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,200
What about my lower right corner and upper left corner?

1869
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,600
How was it graded

1870
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,400
This means that identity and economy interpenetrate

1871
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,200
For some people, two identifications are more important

1872
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,200
For some people the economy is more important

1873
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
bottom right and bottom left

1874
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I can't look at the upper right corner and the lower left corner

1875
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Because it's perfect blue and green

1876
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I'll look at the bottom right and top left

1877
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,000
They have interaction conflicts

1878
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
very anxious

1879
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
my finances push me aside

1880
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
My finances push me the other way

1881
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
The result is split

1882
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
some people voted blue

1883
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
some people voted green

1884
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
This is to represent its two crosses

1885
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
interact with

1886
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
We can dampen the shock with something like this

1887
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Of course now

1888
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
For example, the one from TDS

1889
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
I have read their latest survey

1890
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
There is a question about left and right

1891
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
still bad question

1892
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
so there is no way to catch it clearly

1893
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
But this piece of recognition

1894
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
has developed a lot

1895
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
good

1896
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So for the main axis of political competition in Taiwan

1897
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
research on whether to transform

1898
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
I think it has great theoretical

1899
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
For Taiwan's political and

1900
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
realistic

1901
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
closely related to our actual politics

1902
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Taiwan's foreign relations

1903
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Regardless of cross-strait relations

1904
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Or Taiwan-US relations have a major impact

1905
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Therefore, it is a research worthy of high attention

1906
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Dense

1907
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Thanks

1908
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Thanks

1909
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Welcome to ask questions

1910
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
come please come

1911
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
before asking the question

1912
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I just listened to director Wu's speech, I believe

1913
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
There is a passage inside Hamrabi's flower

1914
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Don't fight too long with female enemies

1915
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
become like him

1916
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Especially when you mentioned Ma Yingjun's Tsai Ing-wen

1917
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
more and more like

1918
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
do you believe this

1919
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Don't fight your enemies for too long

1920
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
so as not to become more and more like him

1921
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
come i want to ask

1922
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Thanks

1923
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
so to sum up

1924
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
then i want to say many times

1925
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You will also be normal to come to which one do you think

1926
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
will be guided very closely

1927
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
achievable

1928
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
So take care of what you need

1929
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
make the problem come back

1930
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
under normal circumstances

1931
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
or Taiwanese society

1932
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I think this seems to be more

1933
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
is normal from to

1934
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
The player's problem

1935
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
So imagine in this direction

1936
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
is it to be cared about

1937
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
they'll pose like this

1938
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
this question is very good

1939
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I agree with what you said

1940
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
That is to say, not everything can be seen as

1941
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
society decides

1942
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
social determinism

1943
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I think there are two things to look at

1944
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
the first is

1945
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,100
Of course, we can't see it as top-down

1946
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:10,000
In fact, every political party must

1947
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,840
Want to maintain the battlefield in your favor

1948
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,200
So if I'm in a battlefield I can beat you up

1949
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,500
You said you don't want to play with me in this battlefield

1950
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,300
you're going to open another game

1951
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:25,340
Then of course I don't want to go there

1952
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,340
but the problem is

1953
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:31,480
Recently my battlefield is real or your battlefield is real

1954
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,600
we have to appeal to the voters

1955
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,340
right

1956
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,540
Because I'm big on my field

1957
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,800
Then I said I've been reading show

1958
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,840
Then I realized that no one came to see my ring

1959
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,680
He just went to see him so long

1960
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:46,600
In the end, I just passed

1961
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,440
So I think the manipulation from top to bottom

1962
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,900
has an inherent limitation

1963
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:55,300
This limitation is an effect on a larger environment

1964
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,160
what is the big environment

1965
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,900
In my whole analysis framework

1966
01:17:58,900 --> 01:17:59,900
I think

1967
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,300
Taiwan's economic development

1968
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,100
is a very important factor

1969
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:12,300
And this factor makes voters think more and more about the economy

1970
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,520
But the Democratic Party does not mean

1971
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,860
Europe and the United States advocate the economy

1972
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:18,460
So the DPP is attracted to this venue by me

1973
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:22,260
I went to the KMT basically to identify with that venue

1974
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,660
was beaten worse than Qing

1975
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,860
Then the proportion said

1976
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,500
Okay, I won't come with you

1977
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,340
I'm half throwing in the towel here

1978
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,140
Then let's play this now

1979
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,040
it's not actually the action

1980
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,100
if it doesn't do the first action

1981
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,980
The DPP can still pull it back

1982
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,440
So I think

1983
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:44,500
The general environment prompts this axis to change

1984
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,940
Of course the Kuomintang has some of its strategies

1985
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:51,300
There is more to this shift

1986
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:52,900
but you may ask a question

1987
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:56,280
You said, let's look at Lebanon

1988
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,440
Let's see Iraq

1989
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,900
We are optimistic about those Kuomintang

1990
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,460
Relatives are finished

1991
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,960
These guys are still fighting, right?

1992
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:10,600
The rift where they fought each other

1993
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,400
either else only read

1994
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,640
otherwise only hit

1995
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,200
The professional school hates the virtual school

1996
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,300
Virtual faction hates that Kurd

1997
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,100
and then make it like this

1998
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:23,500
So I think another factor is

1999
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,460
Identity Differences in Taiwan

2000
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,400
It's not that deep

2001
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:33,900
it can be shifted to this side of the economy

2002
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,900
When the environment will favor its transfer

2003
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,900
If its cut is very

2004
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:40,900
I'm afraid there is no way

2005
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,100
let me give you an example

2006
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,700
We have good show scholars coming to Taiwan for a meeting

2007
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,500
then we talk to him

2008
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,600
wow we're a blue and green opposite

2009
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,500
Ours is badly weathered

2010
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,300
us people hate people

2011
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,100
then they told me

2012
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,200
Really

2013
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:56,700
He and I go outside to see if you are different

2014
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:57,500
What am I talking about?

2015
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,900
we are just different

2016
01:19:58,900 --> 01:19:59,800
I tell you

2017
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,160
if you go to israel

2018
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,680
what is an israeli

2019
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,360
what is an arab

2020
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,240
I can see clearly

2021
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,640
they look different

2022
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,600
speak differently

2023
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
Doing different is living in a different place

2024
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,600
what about you

2025
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,360
so just

2026
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,720
we feel

2027
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,480
The conflict is that Skeleton is here

2028
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,440
In fact, relatively speaking, it is relatively mild

2029
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:22,200
because I feel

2030
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,400
On the one hand there is this

2031
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,480
On the other hand there is a big shock

2032
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,680
causing Taiwan to swing between these two principal axes

2033
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,080
is easier

2034
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,160
At least that's what I've seen so far

2035
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,160
so

2036
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,500
But because of this time becomes

2037
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,300
So it is a process of National Arts University

2038
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,300
But the Democratic Party

2039
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:09,300
The KMT will not take gold for this

2040
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,000
Transfiguration University is because of the six

2041
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,500
But the KMT thing is a kind of

2042
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,900
won't become the whole combination

2043
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,500
The Democratic Party can't think so far

2044
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:25,100
Because when the DPP has reached the economic

2045
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:26,900
when this game comes

2046
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,800
And when the KMT is the government

2047
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,300
It's just desperate to improve the economy

2048
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,300
It must first maintain the situation

2049
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,500
As for what you said, maybe in the long run

2050
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,300
really become like that

2051
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:39,700
it can't handle it

2052
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:44,300
it's all about the next presidential election

2053
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,500
who else

2054
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,900
this one

2055
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,400
i'm curious that is to say

2056
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,100
Before we discuss these political rivalries in Taiwan

2057
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,800
compete with the economy

2058
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,900
When these active conversions

2059
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,000
External influence on Taiwan

2060
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Is it getting smaller

2061
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
That is to say, Taiwan talks about many things behind closed doors.

2062
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Changes to the future under such development

2063
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Are we actually

2064
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
The more lack of a comparative force from the outside

2065
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Because your two pancakes are so much better

2066
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Then you lack a possibility to look outside

2067
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Just compare the direction of our media

2068
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Some effects of receding in the middle

2069
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Because I often feel like you turn off the TV

2070
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
You think the world isn't so bad

2071
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
But when you turn on the TV

2072
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
In fact, many topics are not worth listening to.

2073
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
because there is little room for rational discourse

2074
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
that negative impact

2075
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Is it what you think it will be

2076
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
drive change in our entire society

2077
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I think there are two parts to the story

2078
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
The first people in Taiwan are relatively lacking

2079
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
habit of looking outside

2080
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Following the environment of the media has a lot to do with it

2081
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
this is a serious problem

2082
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
For example, we don't really understand

2083
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Is our government doing well?

2084
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
What does that mean

2085
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Because I don't know what's going on in other countries

2086
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
then let me give you an example

2087
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Like Merkel, he is a big camp

2088
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
recently in germany

2089
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
The most important reason is that

2090
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Because Germans still look around

2091
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It's even worse for France to step on Greece like this

2092
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Italy is outrageous

2093
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Spain is doomed

2094
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
All Europe is Germany

2095
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
very good

2096
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
So they think Merkel is amazing

2097
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
this is a comparison

2098
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Because Europeans are so close to each other

2099
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Do people in Taiwan have an overall international outlook?

2100
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Then understand the environment we are in now

2101
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and then judge our government by that

2102
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I think we lack the ability to look outside

2103
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
for better or worse

2104
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Let's talk about this

2105
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
This is a

2106
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,500
Recently, a certain station is trying to pull our field of vision out

2107
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:11,400
I wish him luck, but I really don't know how it will end up.

2108
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:15,640
In the past, there were quite a few programs that focused on international

2109
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:20,840
It didn't seem to go so well afterward.

2110
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:24,900
OK but the other way around

2111
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:27,640
On the other hand, is there any influence from outside?

2112
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,040
that's the worst

2113
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,600
The outside world greatly affects us

2114
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,640
But we don't know or we don't feel much

2115
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,940
External economic forces have trouble with Taiwan

2116
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:41,040
We are so spiritually dependent on an outward looking economy

2117
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,440
too much influence

2118
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,840
There is a financial tsunami outside

2119
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,340
Isn't Taiwan the same as being blown up?

2120
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:48,640
Outside the economy, even the above things

2121
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,640
The situation on the other side

2122
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,840
The influence of the mainland on Taiwan is growing

2123
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:55,840
This itself is an objective fact

2124
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,040
But his rulers are in no rush

2125
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,340
fuck this thing

2126
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:07,780
so that its influence suffers

2127
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:10,300
I think it's smart to understand that

2128
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,700
But its influence is growing

2129
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,180
So let alone the United States

2130
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:17,180
and then a bunch of stuff

2131
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,980
Okay, so the outside world has a lot of influence on us.

2132
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:23,340
But our understanding of the outside world is very small

2133
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:25,580
I think it's the worst combination

2134
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,980
A better combination should be

2135
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,580
The influence of the outside world on us is limited

2136
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,180
But I understand the outside world very well

2137
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:32,860
Look how good it is, don't you?

2138
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:35,020
Even I affect the outside

2139
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:35,980
Then there is one more thing to say

2140
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:37,180
The field because we have a great influence

2141
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,540
But we also know the outside world well

2142
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:39,260
that's good too

2143
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,860
If it weren't for the outside world's little influence on us

2144
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,060
we don't know the outside world

2145
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,900
Ah, you're old, at least count

2146
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,620
We're messed up by outside influences, right?

2147
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,900
how could we not

2148
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,540
But what we know about the outside world

2149
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:52,460
Actually less

2150
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:53,500
Ah I

2151
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,340
There must be many of you

2152
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:58,100
this is

2153
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,020
on our computer

2154
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,520
Spend a lot of time blah blah blah blah blah

2155
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,620
i have a worry

2156
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,800
as soon as i found out our tv

2157
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,860
What is the news on the broadcast?

2158
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:15,120
let it truncate from internet speed

2159
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,360
Then you see this is exaggerated

2160
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,800
it turns here

2161
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,000
also met someone

2162
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,800
You see, this knight just bounced off

2163
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,160
Woooooo, auntie, play it ten times

2164
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:27,760
And here's one of his most important news

2165
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,400
something like this

2166
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,600
then what what

2167
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,360
Then take a picture of that computer

2168
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,200
What do netizens say

2169
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:36,200
then what is the comment

2170
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,240
And he's not the only one

2171
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,080
This station does this

2172
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:40,960
That station thinks that if I don't do this

2173
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,040
I seem to be behind

2174
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:42,880
he did the same

2175
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,880
I watch different channels

2176
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,600
He is still the same

2177
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,040
the screen on the computer

2178
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:52,640
This, this, if the medium of the Internet

2179
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,680
with traditional media

2180
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:58,280
are highly concentrated in

2181
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,480
to us

2182
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,600
Everything related to daily life

2183
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,560
But it's all together

2184
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,120
this little piece

2185
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,480
but didn't care

2186
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,840
the big world outside

2187
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,840
Words that have had a huge impact on us

2188
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,640
then we are dangerous

2189
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,760
Because we are not very strong

2190
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,600
so i'm worried

2191
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,640
so i ask again

2192
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,800
So if it goes like this

2193
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,960
Look at our media and the Internet

2194
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,960
Let's say they want to bomb an event

2195
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,520
or an issue

2196
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,640
Like the one a while ago

2197
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,040
soldier that red

2198
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,040
red mid autumn

2199
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,040
To Hong Zhongqiu's agenda

2200
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,040
that is

2201
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,040
many people would think that

2202
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,040
he is a civic movement

2203
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,040
is a movement of civil disobedience

2204
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:49,040
then on top of the blue and green parties

2205
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,040
spontaneous

2206
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,040
Spontaneous demands of the common people

2207
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,040
government reform

2208
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,040
But from a certain point of view

2209
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:57,040
because every day the media

2210
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,560
play like this

2211
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
That's how much of it is the spontaneous thinking of real citizens

2212
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
That, or how do we break through this situation?

2213
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Such a dangerous situation in Taiwan

2214
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
That is to say, we are actually a very fragile economy

2215
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
But we don't care about the changes we find around us

2216
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
I think it's like Hong Zhongqiu.

2217
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Did you say there was manipulation?

2218
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Did you say there is media amplification?

2219
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
But you said he has touched a lot of people?

2220
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It will come out automatically, too.

2221
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I know there are a lot of them, it's just like the civil world

2222
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
What faces too much correlation

2223
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Which means he wasn't very involved at all.

2224
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
For example, Mommy is at home

2225
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
After he saw this, he hated the sky

2226
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Because why does he think he is a child

2227
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Looks like his kid is hurting too

2228
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So you said that the speculation on the Internet is so fierce

2229
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And it seems like there's nothing fair about it

2230
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
not bad at all

2231
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I think we lack a common ideal

2232
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
room for debate

2233
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
we lack such a thing

2234
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
one that lets in different voices

2235
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
And as long as you come in

2236
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
let's just say you're in the middle of this

2237
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
no passion

2238
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
but speak well

2239
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Then many people would like to see

2240
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
such a thing

2241
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
We lack that public forum

2242
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
we all have a stand

2243
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
If you say to watch this station

2244
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
then his talk show

2245
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
He will also find a partner

2246
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
The people who are in the camp are coming

2247
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
but then attack him

2248
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
beat him up

2249
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Then see him speechless

2250
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Right

2251
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
there too

2252
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
but this is not

2253
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Then the whole discourse

2254
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,000
have that one-sided nature

2255
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
but there is no place

2256
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
be able to say no matter what you look like

2257
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
emotionally not

2258
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
how unacceptable

2259
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
But you let him finish talking properly

2260
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
then listen to

2261
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I have my own reasons

2262
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,500
this public domain

2263
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:03,100
I think in this field

2264
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:04,300
if bigger

2265
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,300
our whole society will be different

2266
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:10,300
But we are relatively lacking in this area now

2267
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:13,300
We've done a great job of pasting tickets.

2268
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,900
So you're saying we don't have a free press?

2269
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,700
Oh, why not?

2270
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:19,500
but we

2271
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,700
In a few examples

2272
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:25,300
If we talk about politics, this goes to one side

2273
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,300
Because your press is actually a

2274
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,700
to fight for the market, right?

2275
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:35,500
So can you do politically incorrect reporting?

2276
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,300
It's actually stressful

2277
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,200
So I think there's a civic culture

2278
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,000
A culture that allows us to address these issues

2279
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,900
able to make a rational argument

2280
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,300
we have seen this kind of thing

2281
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,500
it's a pity

2282
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,000
I think we should find a way to make something like this come out

2283
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,200
I don't care about individual issues now

2284
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,300
I mean anything on this topic

2285
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,900
There should be something like this

2286
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:09,220
Teacher, I want to go back to some of the arguments mentioned in your speech just now

2287
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,500
and then do some clarification

2288
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,340
Thatâ€™s what the teacher just mentioned about identity and economics.

2289
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:18,940
At a time of shift as the axis of political competition could be his electoral defeat

2290
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:21,260
So his party started to have some shifts

2291
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:24,580
Then I remember when Chen Shui-bian came to power in 2000

2292
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,380
He mentions four emails

2293
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:27,660
Then

2294
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:29,700
Shouting slogans to fight the economy

2295
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,500
Then have a development meeting

2296
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:34,820
At that time, it felt like he was freezing his identity too.

2297
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:39,680
Instead, the axis of competition should be developed towards the economic aspect.

2298
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,220
until that said

2299
01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:44,300
When Dianjia was avoiding the dark, he began to go to extremes

2300
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:49,920
So I started to bring up the issue of recognition again.

2301
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,700
That

2302
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:56,060
My first question is whether there is any way to answer the teacher's speech today

2303
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:59,660
For example, in political operations like this, they are

2304
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,120
When the axis of my political competition shifts

2305
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,320
like Chen Shuibian

2306
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,000
His selection strategy at that time

2307
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,400
Why didn't I continue to expand the development of the economic axis

2308
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,520
Instead I turned to the competition to identify with this

2309
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,000
The second question is

2310
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,160
The teacher is in the conclusion part

2311
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,440
Just mentioned three possibilities

2312
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,280
what i want to know is

2313
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,000
It's the teacher, if you yourself

2314
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,440
You must now represent Taiwan's future politics

2315
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:35,520
development or society as a whole

2316
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,320
Whole development of images to make a whole paragraph or assertion of words

2317
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,880
Do you think Taiwan is moving towards this replacement performance or crossover

2318
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:48,120
Itâ€™s the teacher, which direction do you think it is more?

2319
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,640
Thank you for these two questions

2320
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,400
about the first question

2321
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,520
In fact, this is a big framework

2322
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,960
It is unlikely that it can account for every individual

2323
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
How about you Bian

2324
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I think it's Taiwan's identity energy

2325
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
not fully mobilized

2326
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
so when he tapped him again

2327
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
he actually got a nice reaction

2328
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
only if he keeps going

2329
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
to practice this energy

2330
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
At last he found that he had

2331
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
when approaching the gas mother

2332
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
at this time will be forced to transfer

2333
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
so everyone is trial and error

2334
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
when the leaders of these parties

2335
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
When deciding which strategy to adopt

2336
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
He can't do that

2337
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
true to his best

2338
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
he's trying to do it

2339
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Ah Bian's strategy at that time

2340
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
In fact, it's not just about staying out of the dark.

2341
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
It should be said that in 2003

2342
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
even earlier

2343
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
2001 2002

2344
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
One country actually came out when Nauru established diplomatic relations

2345
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Then in 2003

2346
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
There is a SARS on it

2347
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
then next

2348
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
connected to

2349
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Because Sha Zukang from the mainland is not there

2350
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Tell me who cares about you or what

2351
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,400
At that time, Taiwan felt

2352
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,000
wow we look like this

2353
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,800
We have no way to be received in the world

2354
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,400
You still feel sorry for us

2355
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,500
He also said that if you want to talk to the World Health Organization

2356
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,700
as if there is any connection through it

2357
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:20,600
This thing suddenly becomes a

2358
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:23,400
Strong, intensified, this thing

2359
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,000
Then in 2003

2360
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
When the Democratic Progressive Party celebrates

2361
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,400
Did he mention three tasks?

2362
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:30,100
At this time, it has already been highly tuned out.

2363
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:32,600
Then there was the matter of the referendum

2364
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:38,000
So I think the operation of its election issue is

2365
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,200
You said there was nothing wrong with the economy in the beginning

2366
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:41,800
But the economy at that time

2367
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,600
just a very unfavorable situation

2368
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,500
Since 2000 began to decline

2369
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,800
2001 Didn't you say rich

2370
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,000
Never had

2371
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,400
Of course 2002 was only slightly better

2372
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,600
So in 2003

2373
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,600
you are unlikely to be a ruling party

2374
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:57,600
just mentioned

2375
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,900
According to this good economic performance

2376
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,000
you have to vote for me

2377
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,720
Actually for him

2378
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,520
shift to the positive side of identification

2379
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,520
There is also his motherhood quotes exist

2380
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,400
Of course there are risky leads

2381
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,920
Bian is a person willing to take risks

2382
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,600
And he risked it

2383
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,840
There is this energy that is really mobilized by him

2384
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:20,480
I will actually have an impact on SARS in 2003

2385
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,600
I think we kinda understudied him

2386
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,840
Because of this thing in that paragraph

2387
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:29,360
The emotional impact on everyone is too great

2388
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:31,280
is very very

2389
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,280
Because it's a matter of life for everyone

2390
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,440
So if this thing

2391
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:36,880
able to talk about serious issues

2392
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,480
link together

2393
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,880
He has a lot of mobilizing energy

2394
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,440
Anyway, that's what I meant to say

2395
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,320
Why did Ah Bian take this

2396
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:50,080
Because he wants to be under the situation that the economy is not easy to mobilize

2397
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,440
to try to mobilize another piece

2398
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,680
And after mobilizing this piece

2399
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:56,720
In fact, it has the effect of his weakness

2400
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,320
The person who Virus has risk taking is related again

2401
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,800
But my big structure

2402
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:05,920
Although there is no way to explain

2403
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,120
individual behavior

2404
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:08,720
can explain

2405
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:10,880
If you mobilize mobilize mobilize mobilize to find

2406
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,200
When the energy cannot be mobilized

2407
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,200
you will be forced to change

2408
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,360
So it has that big predictability

2409
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,600
But some small ones don't know

2410
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,880
its all trial and error

2411
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,240
Then the second one you just mentioned

2412
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:24,160
I think

2413
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,560
Which direction do I go?

2414
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,960
i think chris crossing

2415
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,960
yes there is a certain possibility of it

2416
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,400
but like i said

2417
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,200
Its external environment is the economy

2418
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,280
so that thing

2419
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,560
if under its shadow

2420
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,600
will indeed have its influence

2421
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,400
But there is one more thing to note

2422
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,000
when i talk about axis shift

2423
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,760
There are economic factors

2424
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,320
factors that identify with mobilization

2425
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:52,400
There is also the factor of cross-strait relations in the middle

2426
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:55,000
But this discourse in the middle

2427
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,920
In fact, it is very instrumental

2428
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,240
it means to say

2429
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,440
economy is important

2430
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,040
not so much recognition

2431
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,540
For the good of the economy

2432
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:03,840
We must improve cross-strait relations

2433
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,400
so don't make too much recognition

2434
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:10,240
If cross-strait relations are on schedule

2435
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,080
Our economy is still in shambles

2436
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,640
that middle tool twist strap

2437
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,680
easily torn

2438
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,480
once it's ripped

2439
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,020
you don't have to say

2440
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:23,300
to do a good job in the economy

2441
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,340
So we have to follow the other side

2442
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:26,880
Let's talk about the 1992 Consensus or what?

2443
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,160
not at all

2444
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:33,020
If this becomes a common thought of many people

2445
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:37,120
That also refers to the axis rotation we just talked about

2446
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:40,960
so

2447
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,480
hello teacher two

2448
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,260
I just want to ask a question

2449
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:47,360
Then we talked so much about the transformation of the axis of political competition in Taiwan

2450
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,920
So if Beijing as a foreigner

2451
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,200
he came to talk

2452
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:56,580
So Taiwan is now undergoing a transition from political competition to economic recognition

2453
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,900
Then he personally said that he wanted to see this kind of criminal transfer

2454
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I still hope that it will be more beneficial to face him on the ideological battlefield of the original two-party competition

2455
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Because in fact, Beijing, on the one hand, for example, we have him and ACFA

2456
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
He has Fumao to infiltrate Taiwan's economy

2457
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
He came to reinforce what the teacher said you brought

2458
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:21,000
But recently there was an article in Beijing that said

2459
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
He thinks that the KMT has sunk me down

2460
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
He thinks he said that the Kuomintang has begun to withdraw from the field of ideology

2461
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Don't talk about the unification of China or the unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait

2462
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
So he actually has a little anxiety in his heart

2463
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
So the teacher's point of view is that

2464
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
In the end, this kind of typical profession is for Beijing

2465
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
What would he prefer to see

2466
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Thanks

2467
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I think what Beijing wants to see is

2468
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Everyone knows that Taiwan's economy

2469
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Mainland China's goodwill towards Taiwan can boost Taiwan's economy

2470
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
The focus is not on Taiwan's economic growth

2471
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,840
Everyone can feel that cross-strait relations have a great impact on Taiwan's economy.

2472
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,240
is so important

2473
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:09,040
In this way, the people of Taiwan will

2474
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:13,440
while maintaining the existing framework

2475
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,040
Even going one step further with mainland China

2476
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,440
I think the police should think like this

2477
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,840
But he must have thought it wasn't enough

2478
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:23,440
He must be thinking about consciousness

2479
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,440
can have further links

2480
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,040
I think the decision makers in Beijing

2481
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,680
I talked to many scholars in the mainland

2482
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,280
they also talked

2483
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:34,640
They feel as though economically

2484
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,280
Let the mainland's point of view

2485
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,680
seems to be economically

2486
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,680
Also good for Taiwan

2487
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:41,080
Useless

2488
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,480
give him a lot of benefits

2489
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,440
unnamed example

2490
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,680
The swabfish from Xuejia

2491
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,680
As a result, has there been any change in the voting orientation of Xuejia?

2492
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,440
no it's still green

2493
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:54,080
So vote your money for the DPP

2494
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,040
is this

2495
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:56,040
so he was thinking

2496
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:59,080
Is there something deeper that matters more

2497
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,040
he will feel

2498
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,640
culture matters

2499
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,600
So he will want to evoke in Taiwan

2500
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,680
The kind in the earlier period

2501
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:11,440
The one about Chinese culture

2502
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,780
the sense of belonging, the sense of nostalgia

2503
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:15,120
And he often bullies

2504
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:17,880
I already feel that we used to engage in the Cultural Revolution

2505
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,120
you say we're doing it wrong

2506
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,480
now our sister

2507
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,560
The same college makes it all over the place

2508
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:26,500
we didn't get it right

2509
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,520
seems less interested

2510
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,620
Actually, I think his voice

2511
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:34,760
I mean we're a lot like you

2512
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,260
like the recent one

2513
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:38,700
The mainland wants the basic textbook of Chinese culture

2514
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,100
In fact, I want to refer to some of Taiwan's

2515
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,460
This also became their student

2516
01:40:42,460 --> 01:40:43,260
his feeling is

2517
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:44,460
Ah, this is Chinese

2518
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,940
Is this what you're thinking of?

2519
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:46,740
why divide

2520
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:47,640
but what

2521
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,640
something like this

2522
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:49,640
so he will feel

2523
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,040
It is also important culturally

2524
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,240
He for the KMT

2525
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,040
that quit that battlefield

2526
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,440
feel very disapproving

2527
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,000
There used to be a famous

2528
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
The head of the think tank is Zheng Bijian

2529
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
He once led the mainland

2530
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,000
A group of scholars went to Taiwan to talk with these scholars in Taiwan

2531
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Many of these scholars are blue

2532
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Then these scholars also arranged to find one

2533
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Everyone knows our good friend Chen Yindong

2534
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
He is from Lu, right?

2535
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Then served in this MAC

2536
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Then he got up and read a passage

2537
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Then say hello, my opinion is actually different from yours

2538
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
it doesn't matter

2539
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Anyway, I expected this sound to be there

2540
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
What he can't understand the most is Ma Ying-jeou

2541
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Why are there such a group of people around?

2542
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Talk like the Democrats

2543
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
this is what he thinks

2544
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,000
So he thinks it is possible to strengthen the culture

2545
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
And then very worried about Taiwan's change of use

2546
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And then on the other hand

2547
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
before that happened

2548
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Economically, we should try our best to keep Taiwan in check.

2549
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That's not Beijing's grand strategy, is it?

2550
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Excuse me

2551
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
left and right Kuomintang and Democratic Progressive Party

2552
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
future words may be said

2553
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
left and right

2554
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Each party has its own ideas

2555
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:20,000
not that i'm specifically left or right

2556
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
or

2557
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Like the KMT, their logic concept is derived from

2558
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
The economy is not good because the cross-strait relations are not good

2559
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
If cross-strait relations are not good

2560
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I want to promote it, that is to move closer to China

2561
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
So he keeps saying that economy and identity are correlated

2562
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,000
So it is the emergence of the 1992 Consensus

2563
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,000
That's like saying vitamins have ABC's

2564
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But you say A is a vitamin and nothing else

2565
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
in that case would you feel this

2566
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
This logical concept is a bit strange

2567
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Then there is the 1992 Consensus

2568
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
That is, China and Taiwan are singing separately

2569
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
In fact there is an international

2570
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Then do you think it's just a kid arguing over there?

2571
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
just feel

2572
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
very unreasonable

2573
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,440
Then there was the KMT who suppressed trade unions before

2574
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:07,440
But they don't raise money, do they?

2575
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:12,800
Because they can get those properties from the moment they come

2576
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,880
Then he doesn't need any union support.

2577
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,880
that's it

2578
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,880
Yes, the KMT does not need the support of the trade unions

2579
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,880
So he is not a leftist party

2580
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,880
then you just said

2581
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,360
Is this an international look at these two kids fighting?

2582
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,360
You can also say yes

2583
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,200
Not as if we see the Scots he wants independence from England

2584
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,200
we probably don't feel anything

2585
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,200
ok the scots have a lot of feeling

2586
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,200
Because the Scots have a lot of feeling

2587
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,200
how we look

2588
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,200
But if you watch some movies, you might feel something

2589
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,200
good

2590
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:49,200
But don't fight about matters of international concern

2591
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:53,200
I remember I used to go to Singapore to take a taxi

2592
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:55,200
that time happened to be

2593
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,200
At that time, it was not the era of Chen Shuipi, it was the era of Lee Teng-hui

2594
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,200
He immediately rebuked

2595
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,000
Because of you, what are the Taiwanese doing?

2596
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,600
why is he so nervous

2597
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,740
I also want to be so fierce.

2598
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,800
He said that we are going to give the stock a big drop today

2599
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,800
it means you get nervous

2600
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,200
war may follow

2601
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,500
Because of the war, the economy of the entire region will be affected

2602
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,400
will suffer this loss

2603
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,240
So what everyone thinks is you don't fight

2604
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:24,000
So the international thinking is actually like this

2605
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,900
But there is also constant international hope

2606
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:29,040
Taiwan and China are getting closer

2607
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:32,300
Because they are afraid of China's rise

2608
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:34,800
Then you think that if Taiwan and China are combined together

2609
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,700
They are big wars

2610
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:39,740
then i recognized them

2611
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:40,540
I say yes

2612
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:41,940
you don't want us together

2613
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:42,940
put them on

2614
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,000
But he's right

2615
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,340
just say you're right

2616
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:46,840
just get too close and i'm in danger

2617
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:47,840
real

2618
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:48,640
What do you say

2619
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:52,000
What are you willing to give to Taiwan?

2620
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,940
Let Taiwan not be so demanding of mainland China

2621
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:59,140
Then you have to sell five thousand Taiwan

2622
01:44:59,140 --> 01:44:59,940
would you like

2623
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,420
Are you scolding Beijing for being unhappy with promoting relations with Taiwan?

2624
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:11,200
He said he wanted to maintain a good relationship with such a big

2625
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,600
For this he sacrificed Taiwan

2626
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:17,660
And when Taiwan I want to develop some relations with the mainland

2627
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,460
He has started to blame Taiwan

2628
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:21,460
But he can't give Taiwan any benefit

2629
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:24,100
so that

2630
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:29,460
Internationally, it is actually very realistic.

2631
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,920
don't fight

2632
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,960
then you stop

2633
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,960
your current situation

2634
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:36,960
Then

2635
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,960
don't get too close to him

2636
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:41,960
Because I am a little afraid of the big China

2637
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:43,960
Anyway, everything I think about you

2638
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:45,960
Anyway, starting from my own strength

2639
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:46,960
basically like this

2640
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,460
you go ahead and have a problem

2641
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:52,960
Sorry because there seem to be four or five questions

2642
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,960
That is the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party

2643
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:56,960
They each said not to rush away

2644
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:57,960
become leftist or rightist

2645
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,960
is to become leftists and rightists

2646
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
knowledge all together

2647
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Itâ€™s just a party, it has leftist ideas and rightist ideas

2648
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Co-exist

2649
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
not easy

2650
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Because these two are not in the party

2651
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
It is usually said that we engage in luxury tax

2652
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Its rightists always have to oppose it

2653
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I don't know the reason for these rightists

2654
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Maybe it's because of the overlap of ideology

2655
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Or

2656
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
What about the people in the air-conditioned house you drank

2657
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
it is broken disapproval

2658
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
it will have friction on various interests

2659
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Can such a situation exist in the same party?

2660
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Unless your party happens to be just below the middle level

2661
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:41,000
The distance between your left and right is actually not very far from each other

2662
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
that would be possible

2663
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
but my opinion is

2664
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
if the economy is bad

2665
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
It means that the economic endowment becomes smaller

2666
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
When the economic endowment becomes smaller

2667
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
share that talent

2668
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
The truth and the conflict become bigger

2669
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,000
The left and right cutting methods are different

2670
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
very difficult

2671
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I want this party to split into two parties

2672
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:07,000
What is needed is that the party has a relatively large force

2673
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
eat that little power

2674
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
then take it aside

2675
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
it's more likely

2676
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Because I haven't seen in any example

2677
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Horizontal left and horizontal right will appear in the middle of a party

2678
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I'm afraid it's not easy

2679
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Because it still has to maintain a party

2680
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
still have a question

2681
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
good

2682
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Hello Mr. Wu

2683
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
In fact, the problem is a bit similar to the one just now.

2684
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
And I'm curious too

2685
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Did you just mention that there are two axes?

2686
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
We all know this axis.

2687
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
but as a scholar

2688
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
I don't know if you went

2689
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
some thoughts

2690
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Thatâ€™s how we get to the major economy file

2691
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
because it sounds like

2692
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
we can probably accept saying

2693
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
economy is an important issue

2694
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
but you are the last

2695
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
You said something in your tappa game

2696
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
We use left and right to divide

2697
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
In fact, we don't go left and right.

2698
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,300
Alignment with our political party or political competition

2699
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:06,140
It sounds like we are currently or the economy is on this line

2700
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:09,720
Much depends on our economic relationship with China

2701
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:12,800
Including your example of using the EC method is also taking such an example

2702
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,880
so i was wondering if you had some ideas

2703
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:18,180
That is to say, in the case of economics, the face-to-face inquiry is actually

2704
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,720
Maybe it's not about the competition

2705
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:22,020
but one that is highly associated with identity

2706
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:25,860
Or a direction unrelated to identity

2707
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:26,620
Thanks

2708
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:31,480
If we say that the economic route is the same as the recognized route

2709
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:33,280
it should have been mainland words

2710
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,320
of course something went wrong

2711
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:37,880
Because I think a question asked by emerging TTS

2712
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:39,160
it only has one

2713
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:44,040
That is, it wants to ask you about the economy

2714
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,840
Do you think the government should

2715
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:47,880
it has a

2716
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:51,960
its problem

2717
01:48:56,620 --> 01:48:59,180
Um

2718
01:48:59,180 --> 01:49:00,220
it will

2719
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,880
Advocating that the government should promote social welfare economically is to use ten to express

2720
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:05,880
Excuse me, are you closer?

2721
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,880
on this subject

2722
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,880
I think Wu Minnie is here

2723
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,880
As far as Wu Minxi is concerned

2724
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,880
Her lecture seat is very suitable

2725
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,880
so she should make a

2726
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,880
One is social welfare in Hong Kong

2727
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,880
One is social welfare in Hong Kong

2728
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,880
One is social welfare in Hong Kong

2729
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,880
One is social welfare in Hong Kong

2730
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,880
One is social welfare in Hong Kong

2731
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,880
One is social welfare in Hong Kong

2732
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,880
One is social welfare in Hong Kong

2733
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,880
One is very appropriate

2734
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,880
We probably only have this problem

2735
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,880
In addition, other topics are not distinguished

2736
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,880
So basically you can use this question

2737
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,880
come get your

2738
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,880
Mark the left and right items

2739
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,880
0 to 10?

2740
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,880
On the other side, this cultural machine has

2741
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,880
So it can be used like this

2742
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,880
special representation of this space

2743
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,880
like that

2744
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,880
is the 2011 president of the American Political Science Association.

2745
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,880
at his presidential address

2746
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,880
specifically mentioned this

2747
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,880
The axis they thought was still just right

2748
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,880
7 minutes left and right

2749
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,560
But he has now switched to speaking from your point of view

2750
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:04,440
and like this

2751
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,640
It turned out that he came out with a social conservatism

2752
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:10,680
Then his horizontal axis is the household income

2753
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:11,800
he is not around

2754
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,440
he is household income

2755
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,200
The horizontal axis is more interesting

2756
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,880
how often does he go to church

2757
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:22,320
This is to show your conservatism and your profit

2758
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:27,440
Then he found out that household income if so

2759
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:30,040
words from your point of view

2760
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,000
is so

2761
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,200
Is that right?

2762
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,880
Then the higher you go, the more conservative you are

2763
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,320
The lower you go, the more liberal you are

2764
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,760
The farther to this side, the lower the income

2765
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,760
The more you go to this side, the higher your income

2766
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:45,160
so the democrats are here

2767
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:46,440
And the Republican Party is here

2768
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,040
His axis is cut like this

2769
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:49,600
so you don't ask me what i mean

2770
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,480
So it is possible to use something like

2771
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,240
Senior Wu

2772
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,440
In education or in Wu Xuechang

2773
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:58,600
please teach me

2774
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,520
Between identity and economy are two different gates

2775
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,600
Looks like it's depoliticized

2776
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:07,120
There are still some deficiencies

2777
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:09,240
Just a continuation of his previous question

2778
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,840
Economy is still a main axis Life

2779
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,240
actually agreeing here

2780
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:15,200
it's just that we separate it

2781
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,520
for two opposites

2782
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,600
So called separate

2783
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:21,800
You can use the opposition between the upper class and the lower class

2784
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:23,240
or we use the opposite of identity

2785
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:26,400
just a matter of sampling

2786
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,520
practical economic problems

2787
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,360
We can see from the trend of the world

2788
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,360
American welfare

2789
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:33,320
then go to democracy

2790
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:36,360
This slowly walks inside a dead activity

2791
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,920
it's already the world is flat

2792
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:38,960
it has no advantage

2793
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:42,480
Then oil, war, weapons, stuff like that

2794
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:43,680
In fact it has no advantage

2795
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,760
but currently it looks like

2796
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,280
China Korea and Singapore

2797
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,120
It is the dominant power of the whole country

2798
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:53,600
On the contrary, compared with this democratic progressive way

2799
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,600
Productivity is more efficient

2800
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:57,040
so these few

2801
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,600
So from this point of view, for example, the two opposites of democracy

2802
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,560
The two opposing identities of Taiwan

2803
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,220
In fact, there are two hands behind

2804
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:06,160
One is the hands of the CCP and the hands of the United States

2805
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:09,460
Because in the early years we got our economy from the United States

2806
01:52:09,460 --> 01:52:11,660
Benefit Oyen got a lot of orders

2807
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:13,820
Like which side of China is the same?

2808
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:15,860
It will give us quite a lot of benefits

2809
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:18,940
So it's also called what counts for us

2810
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:21,260
What's the benefit?

2811
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,040
It is also to give us some favor

2812
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,320
so wrestling in the back

2813
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,620
It's because of the shadow behind that hand

2814
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:29,960
The CCP and the United States are actually behind the hand

2815
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,240
behind two parties

2816
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:33,540
still have this hand in it

2817
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:36,360
Interfering with Taiwan operations between us

2818
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:37,900
So Taiwan is a

2819
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,440
under the big gear

2820
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,480
middle pinion

2821
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:44,560
So when it comes to Taiwan's identity and economy

2822
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,860
Recognition is just a marketing position

2823
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:49,920
That is to say, to position you and go there

2824
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,460
there must be opposition

2825
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:54,280
This factor actually depends on some other

2826
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:56,840
Does factor come in to see politics more?

2827
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,880
Taiwan's trend will be clearer

2828
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I agree with this thing

2829
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Originally it was an emotional attachment

2830
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
economy is important

2831
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
not just think about it

2832
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
It is also an emotional attachment to the economy

2833
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
but you can say

2834
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
not like that

2835
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
real life needs

2836
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
doomed in gestalt

2837
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
but real life

2838
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
whatever is good

2839
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
how totally unacceptable

2840
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I heard that I am happy not to be in charge

2841
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
that is

2842
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
its living income

2843
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Morality may be quite low

2844
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
but its expectations may not be high

2845
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
So many people are full of the psychological aspect

2846
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Then you just mentioned that

2847
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Identity is more illusory

2848
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Then the economy is a more practical thing

2849
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
i agree

2850
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
these two things

2851
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
in particular

2852
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
not so strong identity distinction

2853
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
When comparing with economic

2854
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
possible economic

2855
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
overwhelm this recognition

2856
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I think Taiwan

2857
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
It's kind of like this situation

2858
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,160
Many of the countries mentioned are like Dongdong

2859
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:04,160
many places

2860
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,560
But I really can't see it at all

2861
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,680
a bit of economic logic there

2862
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:14,720
It's that different race

2863
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:17,040
between different village schools

2864
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,800
deep hatred

2865
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:21,440
So it got to the point where

2866
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,920
it's really hard to draw

2867
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,040
Even if the north shore is the same as the south

2868
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:28,120
So I think it might depend on the place

2869
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:31,880
But there is no such thing in Taipei anymore

2870
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:33,160
you just said

2871
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,600
Is there a hand outside?

2872
01:54:34,600 --> 01:54:35,920
of course

2873
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:36,920
Then it manipulates

2874
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:38,720
of course we manipulate

2875
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:42,880
but manipulator

2876
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,320
nor can it decide

2877
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,720
what will the ending be

2878
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,440
Let me give another example

2879
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,280
You see the United States is so powerful

2880
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:54,440
The overlord of the world ran to fight

2881
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:58,440
It's the sinful Afghanistan.

2882
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,600
13 years of fighting

2883
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,000
Yes or no

2884
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,500
Right, how about it? It will push the Tulian to withdraw its troops. It may not be possible to deal with him.

2885
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:12,000
What do you say about the physical, cultural, military, and political power that you want to stop?

2886
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Guardianship of the poorest circle

2887
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
He has nothing to do with him

2888
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,500
So the power of diplomacy is to influence Taiwan

2889
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:25,000
But the way he influences results

2890
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,500
It may also be beyond the power of diplomacy to conceive

2891
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:33,000
Another point is that no one likes to be manipulated.

2892
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:38,000
So if you take us to the crossbar, who is very clearly manipulating us?

2893
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
he may have a distaste will come out

2894
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,500
Because antipathy could also turn into an election

2895
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:47,500
a very important factor

2896
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:52,000
What you said is what I agree with, on a large scale

2897
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
But when the actual sexual desire has an impact, it depends on the situation.

2898
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
What impact will it have when

2899
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,500
He knew it very well Zhu Wenqing

2900
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,440
once before the taiwan election

2901
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:08,640
I'll let you guys feel that you can't do anything wrong.

2902
01:56:08,640 --> 01:56:11,340
As a result, after you talked about this

2903
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,840
Elections in Taiwan

2904
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,840
The child did not achieve what he wanted

2905
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:17,340
so

2906
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:21,340
Hello, teacher

2907
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:23,340
Excuse me, just ask

2908
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:27,340
In the process of transaction reform

2909
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:30,840
There are so-called multi-entry water and multiple copies in one tank

2910
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,840
Is that a multi-cylinder?

2911
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,340
It is this history and luck

2912
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:37,840
A prohibition on the question of identity

2913
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,340
That is to say

2914
01:56:39,340 --> 01:56:40,840
When the Democrats were in power

2915
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:42,340
This syllabus is

2916
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:43,340
bully sinicization

2917
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:45,840
When the Democratic Party was in power

2918
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,340
It's just bullying Taiwan

2919
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:50,840
If you are a general recruit of a course

2920
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:52,840
History or Chinese Yunhua

2921
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,340
General tricks in Chinese English

2922
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:58,340
or a trade worker

2923
01:56:58,340 --> 01:57:00,340
then you should be

2924
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
how to take responsibility

2925
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Or just pay attention when students take exams

2926
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
How much Gao Wen can take an exam?

2927
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Can go to star high school or star university

2928
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
You will pay more attention to that impression

2929
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
then you will have a hard time answering

2930
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
because you are a teacher

2931
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
this is no way

2932
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
His syllabus determines

2933
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Textbook decided

2934
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Then the exam is like that

2935
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Of course you let your students

2936
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
able to do well

2937
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
So in that situation

2938
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
how to get him out

2939
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
The standard answer that is considered correct

2940
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
you can't say easily

2941
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
The classmate's current textbook has changed

2942
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
but the current direction

2943
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
so you make us

2944
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:42,000
For this reason

2945
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
considered wrong

2946
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,000
We still have to choose D

2947
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
instead of choosing A

2948
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
it's hard

2949
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
then you talk about that

2950
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
In the beginning this and that decision

2951
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
What should be the curriculum

2952
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
that stuff is more difficult

2953
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,000
why is it difficult

2954
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
because it's ingrained

2955
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
values â€‹â€‹and beliefs

2956
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,500
see many historians

2957
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:03,900
The view of each other is south far north side

2958
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:06,300
have heard their editorials on many occasions

2959
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:07,700
some people think

2960
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:09,680
Taiwan is a Chinese nation

2961
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:12,940
like the one in this extension

2962
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:14,840
one this

2963
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:16,880
how to say

2964
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:17,840
one

2965
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:18,780
a river street

2966
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:20,540
a pioneering region

2967
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:21,780
So here's the

2968
01:58:21,780 --> 01:58:23,280
all this

2969
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:24,840
This traditional Chinese culture

2970
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:25,880
then in this

2971
01:58:25,880 --> 01:58:27,480
Under this special situation

2972
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:29,780
Then this displayed

2973
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:31,180
i really thought you understood

2974
01:58:31,180 --> 01:58:33,580
Some people don't see it that way at all

2975
01:58:33,580 --> 01:58:35,680
Then he imagined himself

2976
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:37,580
Follow the influence from mainland China

2977
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:38,180
or something

2978
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:42,080
is highly repulsive

2979
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:45,380
because how do you go

2980
01:58:45,380 --> 01:58:46,180
I got it

2981
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:47,080
Actually now

2982
01:58:47,080 --> 01:58:49,980
what actually happened

2983
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:53,480
The Democratic Progressive Party will say that scholars who have a little more access to the road will go in

2984
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,580
The KMT will try to squeeze more scholars into it

2985
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:58,580
Some people are tighter

2986
01:58:58,580 --> 01:59:00,580
Some people are more skillful

2987
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Some people are not strong enough

2988
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
and how to get the final syllabus

2989
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
A Political Compromise

2990
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
this is what actually happened

2991
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
this is what actually happened

2992
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
It is actually reflected in Taiwan's own

2993
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,000
The confrontation of many values

2994
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Just like the stone hills in the mainland I just mentioned

2995
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
stone hill

2996
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Mathematics and Mathematics

2997
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
talk about interests

2998
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Each of these can tell something

2999
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
But it doesn't really matter there

3000
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
when speaking

3001
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Does it touch my heart

3002
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
As for whether it touches my heart

3003
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
It depends on my growing environment

3004
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
background family etc.

3005
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
are directly linked

3006
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
i find it difficult

3007
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
this thing to comment

3008
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
But the syllabus is set, the textbook is set

3009
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
people who read the syllabus

3010
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
will have a certain opinion

3011
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
this is yes

3012
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
No wonder both sides want

3013
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
scramble so fast

3014
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Dominance?

3015
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
OK

3016
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
we are only for a minute

3017
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,000
So our young friend from earlier

3018
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I'm asking for advice after the meeting

3019
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
i said a few words before

3020
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Director Wu gave a very brilliant speech today

3021
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
But his answer is still on the ground

3022
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
It's just that political scientists are different from my historians.

3023
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
once i was at a dinner party

3024
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
anxious to go home

3025
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Japan finds Tian University's vice president

3026
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
say anything

3027
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
what are you doing in such a hurry

3028
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Will it still be common?

3029
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Will it still be common?

3030
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
tends to be a nice guy

3031
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
not later

3032
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
text is writing the same

3033
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
But politics is different

3034
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Political science will not be the same the day after tomorrow

3035
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Look at Director Wu's topic today

3036
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
left for us

3037
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, the Democratic Progressive Party of the Jiangnan Kuomintang

3038
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
what has become

3039
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Still uncustomized

3040
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
still developing

3041
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
leave us with a question to think about

3042
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
a thinking difficulty

3043
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Thank you for his wonderful speech today

3044
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Thanks

3045
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Thank you.
