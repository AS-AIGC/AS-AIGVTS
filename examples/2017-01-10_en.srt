00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,180
find

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,740
Ask

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I would like to welcome everyone to participate today

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,200
we tonight

5
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Speech at the Knowledge Feast of the Institute of Public Studies

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Everyone has seen the title of our speech today

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,200
First of all, I would like to introduce our speaker today

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,600
The protagonist is our Dr. Xu Wenlian

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,200
The current Institute of Information Science

10
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,700
Special researcher and director

11
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,500
Director Xu was in 1973

12
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,900
Graduated from National Taiwan University Department of Mathematics

13
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,100
in 1979

14
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,700
Cornell University

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,300
He is a Ph.D. in Operational Studies

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,100
Because it is Operation Research

17
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,900
in 1980

18
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,300
Taught at Northwestern University

19
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,900
Got a permanent offer

20
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,100
but probably feel

21
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,700
Should be returning home to serve

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,500
So in 1989 when

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,000
back to

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,160
Academia Sinica Information Service

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,540
Now the director of the Information Office

26
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:11,160
When Professor Xu was at Northwestern University in his early days

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,560
His research focuses on

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,300
The Theory of Mindful Algorithm

29
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,460
His two papers on planar perfect graphs

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,760
is a classic in this field

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,960
He is also working in computational biology

32
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,520
In the analysis and alignment of DNA sequences

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,920
Many error-dissolving algorithms have been designed

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,400
According to the series of proteins

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Prediction of function and structure

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Analysis of Hezhipuyi Therapeutic Medicine

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
after he returns home

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Continuing research on these theoretical aspects

39
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Then also take the experience of these algorithms

40
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Applied in Chinese natural language research

41
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,460
and system development

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,000
Then developed the intelligent

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Make sound input method

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So in 1993 published the state-run input method

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,600
Won the first Top Ten Outstanding Chinese Information Products Award

46
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,560
Then published the natural input method in 1995

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,200
These experiences of subsequent artificial intelligence research

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,120
Also applied to the Internet for Chinese question answering system

49
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,040
So with robotics research

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,240
So we might hear something about that today

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,240
These studies have implications for building large-scale language application systems in industry

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,400
For example, online customer service

53
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,840
Sentiment analysis of Q&A opinions within the enterprise

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,200
Or product recommendations, etc. are very suitable

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,200
Professor Xu's outstanding research

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,800
He has received three National Science Council Distinguished Awards

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Then won the first Li Guoding Chuanshi Award

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,840
There is also the American IEEE

59
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,400
is a meeting of an association

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,900
There are many awards from the Pan Wenyuan Research Association for the Central Plains Award

61
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,000
2012 Information Medal of Honor from the Information Society of the Republic of China

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,080
So in addition to his cognition in the Central Plains Academy

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,440
Also served as the chairman of the Republic of China Society for Artificial Intelligence

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,760
and the chairman of the Institute of Computational Linguistics, etc.

65
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,800
Say a lot about service experience

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,160
Has a track record of award-winning research

67
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,540
So our Knowledge Award Academy hopes to say

68
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,420
Introduce to everyone the comparatively contacted research in the Central Plains Institute

69
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,060
Then I hope to be able to say in a more common language

70
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,400
Introduce to the public what we are doing with this research

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,800
So today we see that the topic of this speech is about

72
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,160
The field of artificial intelligence is probably

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,500
A field that was only founded 60 years ago

74
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,500
You can see that it has largely fallen in the past 60 years

75
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
just nerves are very hot

76
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,000
Then there was a period of time when the development was slower

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,500
But recently because of deep learning

78
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,500
So in this area it's re-emphasizing

79
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,000
So we are talking about Artificial Intelligence in this

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,500
artificial intelligence

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There have been many other recent developments related to

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,500
It makes everyone in the academic world have some new perceptions of this field

83
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,000
We also saw in the newspaper recently that there is Google's Appagope

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We put Weiqi some national players

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The world's masters are all defeated

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So it is to use a concept of deep learning

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Only then did such great results be achieved

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So let's start now by saying we want to be able to

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To predict when we can use these

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
APAGO's Language Prediction System

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
understand the system

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So in this speech

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
we'll see some introduction to this

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So natural language understanding

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is the last level of artificial intelligence

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So I think Xu Shuochang is right about this topic

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I won't say more

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We will listen to Xu Shuochang's speech

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
see what is called

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The final hurdle of artificial intelligence

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
so we now

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I hope everyone with the warmest applause

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Come and welcome our host today

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Introduction by Vice President Zhou

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you all for coming

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I have this opportunity to share with you

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So many years of research

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
i remember ten years ago

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I also talked about the feast of knowledge here, and I also talked about artificial intelligence

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,200
But the progress of the past ten years is actually very dramatic

111
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,400
So I would like to share my personal research experience on language

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,000
This research will actually have a great impact on everyone, especially young people

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,700
Because in the future, if the ability of computers to understand natural language increases, many jobs will disappear

114
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:35,300
We can now see that Hon Hai claims to have an army of 40 million in the mainland, and tens of thousands of them are robots

115
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,400
His entire factory is now called a factory without lights, and there is no need to turn on the lights at all.

116
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,500
can get things done from start to finish

117
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:49,000
So in the future when the white-collar class handles paperwork in the office, the computer can help you write and read letters

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,500
Of course, that level is relatively shallow, but he can do a lot of secretarial things

119
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,400
This is a future one, it will happen within five years

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So I now name this as the final level of artificial intelligence

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Because everyone knows that computers have also made rapid progress in vision recently.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Can tell cats and dogs apart which means it doesn't need much of these people's intervention

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
it can be done

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But it's far from there

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Speech is progressing rapidly

126
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now everyone has used Google's audiobook

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
or Siri's voicebook is known to be very accurate

128
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's just that it doesn't understand

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In most cases it just uses other technologies to correct the speech

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but it doesn't understand what you're talking about

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So let's take a look today

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is to understand what you are talking about

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
how difficult is this

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So my Daeko is like this today

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll start with a simple personal brevity

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
then artificial intelligence

137
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
natural language understanding

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The last thing is to say which jobs will be replaced by computers

139
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
personally

140
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Since I was a child, I prefer to use my brain rather than my hands.

141
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,800
i often think

142
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
At that time, of course

143
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,700
All of our environments are very

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,100
Very difficult to do a lot of automated things

145
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,100
I'm studying mathematics in college and it's a good training

146
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Because I find the theories that are the most difficult to say

147
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,900
Probably we've all been through it and don't necessarily say it's a good read

148
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,400
But we at least after

149
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,300
go to other fields

150
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,400
No threshold does not mean easy

151
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,800
It means that your mathematics is basically fearless

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,100
Well, it's actually not easy for many people.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
So early artificial intelligence

154
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
is proved by logic and theorem

155
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,000
The earliest artificial intelligence actually has very few systems

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,300
because then you know

157
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,700
Computers are really underpowered

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
When I was studying at National Taiwan University

159
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,200
whole school

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What is the memory of the computer in National Taiwan University?

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Can you guess it?

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now we may be 16GB

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
that is 16K

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Not 16K sorry

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
16GB

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Just 16GB can't do anything at all

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So I used to do theory

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do theory

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Syneron Puffing is the automatic proof of theorem

170
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This was very popular before

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
There is a famous professor in our country

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
in doing this

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
very old professor

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Do you know who it is?

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
very famous

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Professor Li Jiatong

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
he doesn't mention it now

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because he did it then and later he

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I think he kind of hates the field

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He thinks that automatic proof is too difficult

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So in the future, he will treat people who do AI

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
a little disgusted

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Thanks

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,940
At that time, AI academics talked more and did less

185
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,840
this is impossible

186
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,140
Because the computer age was very slow at that time

187
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,780
We should have written this 30 years ago

188
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,620
I made a mistake in the constant number 30 years ago

189
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,620
I went there in 1980 when I was teaching at Northwestern University

190
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,620
In 1982, I saw the first Datong green screen

191
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,960
If you're old enough to know

192
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,460
The first generation of IPM computers

193
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,420
The hardware is almost all made by Datong

194
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,960
So its little screen is a green

195
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,760
Appeared in 1982

196
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,960
This caused a great shock in Western countries

197
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,160
Almost all typewriters disappeared within half a year

198
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,600
I used to use electric typewriters

199
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,360
Later, it was all replaced by computer screens.

200
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,520
Even kindergarten kids can play by themselves

201
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,360
So this is a very natural thing in pinyin countries

202
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,260
Because it only has 26 keys and 26 subtitles, it can type out all languages

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,840
But Chinese is extremely difficult

204
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,840
At that time, professional typing companies were using the Changjie input method.

205
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Now you may rarely hear that you have to recite those Changjie horses.

206
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,240
Changjie input method

207
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,240
The Zhuyin input method was immature at that time

208
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
is very high error rate

209
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,740
Therefore, we hope to develop automatic phonetic selection input in foreign countries.

210
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,180
We often compare a person who can't type Chinese

211
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,180
It's a foreigner on a computer

212
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,180
That is, he still needs translation when facing the computer

213
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,180
At that time, we had many teachers who received

214
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Both English and English can be typed

215
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,180
This wasn’t in 1982, probably when I returned to Taiwan in 1990

216
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
He can type all English letters without any problem.

217
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,180
But as soon as he comes across Chinese, he prints it out

218
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,180
and write his reply on it

219
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,620
Then ask the secretary to type the reply letter into Chinese and send it out

220
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,620
So earlier

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,160
Almost all secretaries will participate in the input method

222
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,760
that's why

223
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,400
I think communicating with the computer is a very important communication

224
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
If a country is productive

225
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,960
You can communicate with the computer only when you use English

226
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,320
Chinese is not good at all

227
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,520
this is a very poor one

228
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,960
So we spent a lot of time doing Chinese

229
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,520
But the first thing I did was because I needed to type Chinese

230
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,720
i saw that jubangful early

231
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,720
How does he do that reference input method

232
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
But I don't want to recite that section

233
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I have another problem when I fight Zhu Ying

234
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
It's the current standard keyboard

235
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,560
is four rows

236
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,720
English English playing is three rows

237
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,680
all in the middle

238
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,360
and very

239
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,120
It is very convenient

240
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,960
So I was

241
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,680
At the beginning, I made this natural input method

242
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,040
One reason is because I don't like using the standard keyboard

243
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,080
I must develop a keyboard of my own

244
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,920
So then there was a Xu-style keyboard

245
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,960
then me

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,840
I'll talk about it later, back to the Central Plains in 1989 with Mr. Chen Kejian

247
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,600
He is a very senior research scholar in our field

248
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,640
In 1991, an initial heart system was probably established.

249
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,960
Then when we made it in 1991

250
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Probably until the information month of 1992

251
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,520
We didn't really launch a product until December

252
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,280
It was also written by an outside company for me.

253
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,880
Because we have no idea how to write such a commercial system

254
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,040
The system used at that time may not have been heard by most of you

255
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
called DOS

256
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:43,720
The memory of the entire computer in the DOS system can only control 640K

257
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,720
640K less than a Mega

258
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,600
Now we have a Mega for every photo

259
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Its entire computer is 640K

260
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,760
So you're going to make a sulva, squeeze it in this

261
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,000
Then all the rules of all the warehouses must be entered.

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,160
very difficult, so the theory I did

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This algorithm helps a lot with this

264
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So we mourned the name in natural calligraphy in 1990

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
By 1995, Microsoft hoped to be able to license our calligraphy

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
he speaks very well

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
他說It's your honor to be used by

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It is your honor to be placed in Microsoft, right?

269
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That means I don't really need to give you money.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
not that we want the money

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We think he probably wouldn't talk to the inventor like that in a foreign country

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's a very rude thing in my opinion.

273
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
so we refuse

274
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Then we officially approved this funding in 1999 and downloaded it for free

275
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So it has been the champion of all downloaded software for seven consecutive weeks

276
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Then my important calligraphy is to say

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There is a Xu Zhijian card inside

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
All those who can type English but not Chinese when they come back from abroad

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It happens to be my training object

280
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So at that time, Chen Wenchun, the principal of Tsinghua University,

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
of course i want

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Find someone older to teach

283
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
He really learned it in about ten minutes.

284
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
It's his correspondence with that Zhuyin

285
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
I remember it in ten minutes

286
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
There is also an alto director on the TV of the Ministry of Education

287
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
He said using the happy history is a growing professor

288
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
He said I want to help you promote

289
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I said you can't help me promote in academia

290
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
that this is actually

291
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
transcribe

292
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
each of us

293
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
There are about five to fifteen homophones below Zhuyin

294
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
So you typed out ten words

295
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,600
That's a huge number of combinations

296
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
if you don't understand

297
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,900
this

298
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
people who don't understand Chinese

299
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,300
It's very difficult to spell it out

300
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
So now the audio book

301
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,600
voice book words

302
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,800
one tone below

303
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
If you pronounce a sound, there may be

304
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
there are fifty to one hundred

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,800
possible word

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,300
Because his confusion is high

307
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
So so many confusing words inside

308
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,000
To be able to turn him all right

309
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,800
looks like

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,520
mission impossible

311
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,120
Now you seem to Google me all at once

312
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,720
In fact, there are many tricks in it

313
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,320
So I talk about this current lack of understanding

314
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,080
It's just that I don't have a trick

315
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,000
This system can be made quickly

316
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,640
let me tell you now

317
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
You may understand right now

318
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,480
You put the information on this network

319
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,280
Every seven characters are memorized by a window

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,120
Then memorize the pinyin below it

321
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,840
just like this

322
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,400
After memorizing an article

323
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,760
After memorizing about hundreds of thousands of articles

324
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,280
The combination of these words and pinyin you memorized

325
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,400
take what anyone says

326
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,280
almost what he said

327
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,800
There will be a part in the middle that is the same as this

328
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,000
right away

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,640
So don't think Google is great

330
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,000
It's actually quite a simple way

331
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Then we are also working on the mobile version now

332
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,200
Both Chinese and English are preferred

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,920
It is very convenient to type in English

334
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,960
You may not remember some English words firmly

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
or it's too much trouble

336
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
like we have a biological DNA

337
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The word DN is Doxyribonucle

338
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There are 13 letters

339
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I don't want to go even if I beat you

340
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
One by one will make a mistake

341
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so our

342
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Because our system probably hits 3 or 4 keys

343
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
just type it out

344
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's start with the introduction of artificial intelligence

345
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
In fact, in my previous profile, I have already put

346
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Some of my relationship with artificial intelligence

347
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
have spoken out

348
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Wait a minute we'll use the example

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to explain more artificial intelligence

350
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
How artificial intelligence first designed machines to

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
simulated intelligence

352
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is actually very complicated

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
How much do you want to simulate a human

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What we are talking about today is relatively simple

355
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It is to help human beings solve problems in life and work

356
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
simple problem encountered

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't want to talk about that

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Their Favorite Philosophers Talk About Conscious

359
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
will he know he exists

360
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
then will he have feelings

361
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it's all very complicated

362
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we are interested in saying

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,500
Assistant-like functions can accept natural language instructions

364
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
able to do this

365
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,700
Many of our document processing is very simple

366
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,000
Like I often have problems when using PowerPoint

367
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
i want this

368
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,000
Like some screens are 19%

369
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
169% is relatively wide

370
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,000
Some screens are 40% to 30%

371
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,500
like this is 4 into 3

372
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,700
Then I want to turn my slideshow into 16 to 9

373
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,500
if he could understand

374
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I told him to turn the screen into 16 to 9

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,500
he will soon

376
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,500
If you read his manual

377
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Indicates how many keys to press

378
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
and that no one will know

379
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
So this is a very important

380
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,000
So how to make software and home appliance manuals answer automatically

381
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The same goes for home appliances

382
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
You buy a new cooler now

383
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
right

384
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,000
Maybe that controller on the old chiller next to it

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
already familiar

386
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,500
But new ones have to be learned again

387
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
then what we want is to say

388
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I told him it's too hot now

389
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
It stops after two hours

390
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
How about turning it off an hour before I go to bed?

391
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,500
It doesn't matter what brand you are for this kind of thing

392
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't even need to read the manual if you can understand

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So the ideal in the future is to say that all these manuals disappear

394
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,500
completely unnecessary

395
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,000
The company's customer service staff don't need to answer questions.

396
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Then the Homepage made by each of us can conduct question and answer

397
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What does it mean

398
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Now the Homepage says when and where did you graduate from?

399
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
what are you doing?

400
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Many people who are looking for a job hope that others can visit his webpage

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This can be a passive one seeing

402
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If you want to be proactive

403
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
People can ask questions on your website

404
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You don't even need to come to your website

405
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
just ask a question say

406
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Which school Xu Wennian graduated from, he can answer right away

407
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So we're spending a lot of money now to make this page

408
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We're going to pay for this automated answer in the future

409
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
but this automatic answer

410
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
yes some packages

411
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,400
Just put your knowledge in it now

412
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,600
it can answer

413
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,800
It's better that you don't need to spend any more money

414
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,400
The following is the IoT

415
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,800
It is the devices of the Internet of Things

416
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,000
able to operate by itself

417
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
this is very important

418
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,200
So we talk about smart cities

419
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Smart families are talking about

420
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,000
A Natural Language Human-Machine Interface

421
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,000
All of these mechanized actions below

422
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,800
In fact, its difficulty is relatively low

423
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,600
The hardest thing is to understand what you want to do

424
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,200
So the field of artificial intelligence research

425
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,800
There are the following

426
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,100
Everyone is familiar with this

427
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,600
This is image processing

428
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Then Graphics

429
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
Next is the robot

430
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,900
Then Speed ​​Recognition

431
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,000
speech recognition natural language

432
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Then give up the whole language

433
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,500
search engine

434
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,800
machine learning

435
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,200
Data Mining

436
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
biological information

437
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,100
These are all like AI

438
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,500
born of a child

439
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,600
at different times

440
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,500
but a few years ago

441
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,540
5 years ago to ask people in these fields

442
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,000
He said I no longer do AI

443
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,500
why do this

444
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,740
Can you figure it out?

445
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,240
That is to say, AI used to have a very bad livelihood

446
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,700
Just because he gets too many research grants

447
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,640
Especially the funding of the U.S. military

448
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,640
I don't know how much is invested in AI

449
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,340
did not get any

450
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,140
very little benefit

451
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,300
So to be a scholar of AI

452
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,140
There are many coming and going

453
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,940
How many years has it been like this

454
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,740
did not achieve his purpose

455
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,240
like my wife used to talk about the stuff i made

456
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,580
He thinks this level is really not high enough

457
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,340
I say it's already the best in the world

458
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,140
that's useless

459
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,780
It is true that the user does not know his technical details at all

460
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,780
His pickiness is the truest

461
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,480
Let's now look at the United States in this

462
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,180
hollywood they do this

463
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,380
Any new field his imagination is super shallow

464
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,580
So let's look at this

465
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,080
What the film industry expects from AI

466
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,400
2001 space exploration written, this was done in 1968, I don't know how many people read it

467
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,400
At that time it was Stanley Kubrick, he wrote a supercomputer number HAL

468
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,900
That is, the captain of the spaceship talks to the computer entirely by voice

469
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Then why is this account a very good computer, because every word of it is in front of IBM

470
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,900
That is to say, he deliberately regarded IBM as the best computer, and every letter of HAL is one in front of IBM.

471
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:38,900
So he was in front of IBM, and behind that there was an AI artificial intelligence in 2001, and many people have seen it

472
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:46,900
This is the first robot that knows what love is, so his love is quite scary, that is to say, in unconditional

473
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,900
so by the end his mother was freaking out

474
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:59,900
2004 Public Enemy of Robots, which means that every house has 3 to 5 robots to do all the house cleaning

475
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Later, the robot was disobedient and had some problems.

476
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,200
Piano player in the cloud 2013

477
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,040
this person is totally lonely

478
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,000
He completely uses this text message

479
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,680
Chatting with another invisible person

480
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,640
a woman

481
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
that's called semansa

482
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
After talking, he really felt that he loved him very much.

483
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But he once asked him a question

484
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,240
He said how many people are you dating at the same time

485
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,680
He said 365

486
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,400
Also this terrible thing

487
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
So the comprehensive plan for 2014

488
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
That means this is a scientist played by Johnny Depp

489
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,000
Then at this time he can continue his life

490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,880
this is a new idea

491
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,960
Then let me talk about it now

492
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,280
AlphaGo and Natural Language Understanding

493
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,280
These two discrepancies correspond to natural language for machines

494
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
responsible for far more than the period

495
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Because there are many self-evident common sense

496
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
derived or derived knowledge

497
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
For example, before you get off work today

498
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In Line, your wife sent a message saying

499
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
no cooking tonight

500
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
what does that mean

501
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
there are two

502
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
one for learning and one for excellence

503
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
it's good to say

504
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Two can go out and find a good

505
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
delicious restaurant, right?

506
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The other one is to say what are you doing around here today?

507
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
forgot something so he doesn't cook

508
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
then this thing

509
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It is a bit difficult for a machine to understand

510
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Language understanding is often associated with larger contacts

511
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So this contact is

512
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The environment in which he spoke today

513
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Like what's the news today

514
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
A lot of these things are contact

515
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
how do you know where he is from

516
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Get some Message written by

517
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The relatively simple rules for the term

518
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
The rule is that you surround each other

519
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Then he dies with only one eye left

520
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
die with only one eye left

521
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Now all artificial intelligence

522
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
can go to see

523
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
our video today

524
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
How about thank you all

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
thank you all

526
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Everything that is done on this is a single

527
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
objective optimization

528
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
like the goal of surrounding him is to win

529
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So he put a lot of chessboards down

530
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The end result is win or lose

531
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
make this the last goal

532
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Now this deep learning is very well trained in this area

533
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
He can even play with himself

534
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
He can memorize the result when he wins or loses at the end

535
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Then do a lot of interesting analysis below

536
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The earliest computer worker Turin

537
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It's a pity to live to be 42 years old

538
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He thought of a test

539
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Is it a machine or a human?

540
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Do you have the ability to approach people?

541
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
A simple test he did

542
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Just put a tester in the first room

543
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
one person

544
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Put two computers in the second room

545
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
one is real

546
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
is also a terminal

547
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
you can message him

548
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
A machine is a piece of software

549
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,200
So if the person on the left

550
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,300
he can't tell

551
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,200
he can give him 30 minutes

552
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,000
If he can't tell which one is the machine

553
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,200
which one is human

554
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,600
that machine is successful

555
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
so he said this

556
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
what is understanding

557
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,100
is the last

558
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,600
You can't tell if he's a human or a machine

559
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,200
So AI research

560
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,800
Heart failure ups and downs are very many times

561
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,100
This is a

562
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,900
Norville Economist

563
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,500
winner of economics

564
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,300
Herb assignment famous

565
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,200
at Connected Manor

566
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,800
他說Machine will be capable within 20 years

567
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,700
of doing any work a man can do

568
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,200
This was spoken in 1965

569
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,800
1985 is about to happen

570
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,100
everyone knows no

571
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,800
AI rehearsals are in

572
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,300
Scholars at MIT

573
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,100
Marvin Minsky

574
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,400
two years after him in 1967

575
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
He said within a generation

576
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,400
the problem of creating artificial intelligence

577
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,000
was substantially be solved

578
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,900
So because of these people's

579
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,300
So a lot of research funding is thrown away

580
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,900
But the effect is very limited

581
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,900
So let's look at some examples of failure

582
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,300
This is of course more expensive.

583
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
so i put it here

584
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Japan's fifth-generation computer in 1982

585
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,500
At that time, Japan's national power was very strong.

586
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,300
they have a lot of money

587
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
so what

588
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,300
He wanted to create a computer that was fast and could understand people

589
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,500
The result is nothing

590
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,300
Let it go

591
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
This Japanese compares

592
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
He is inside

593
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
for being quick to admit mistakes

594
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,900
But he doesn't want to admit his mistakes

595
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,000
so how do we know

596
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,600
because he made a famous

597
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,900
so-called battery point

598
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,100
He thinks this electronic pool point is all-encompassing

599
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,900
can solve many human problems

600
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,200
when he finally finished

601
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,900
This electronic battery point

602
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,900
He would have sold millions

603
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Later, you can buy it for 10,000 Taiwan dollars

604
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,800
It's basically called a jump price

605
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,000
no one wants

606
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,200
Another CYC Project is also a

607
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
very famous 1984

608
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
there is a very

609
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,500
He wants to collect a lot of try

610
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Then the computer can think like a human in the future

611
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
He tried to use logic to choose

612
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,500
because at that time logic was what they used most

613
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,500
But this project later because there is no specific application

614
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
while daytime demonstrations

615
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
he still exists

616
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
But you can also go to license

617
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
But very few people use it

618
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Because they never thought about how to use my knowledge

619
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
so it's a pity

620
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
And this one is full...

621
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Japan's entrance examination robots set their goals in 2014

622
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
To be admitted to the University of Tokyo

623
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Just like our entrance exam

624
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
We have about five or six subjects

625
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Each subject will give you textbook reference books

626
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Or some related news?

627
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
You can go to the exam like a human

628
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Then this thing is not only made in Japan

629
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Mainland China spent 20 billion yuan

630
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
about two years ago

631
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
voted two or three years ago

632
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
20 billion, let's not talk about RMB

633
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Our NT$20 billion

634
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,600
20 billion also happened from there

635
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,760
he's just in this one

636
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,480
Robots 20 billion yuan was spent on exam robots

637
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,880
for about a dozen schools

638
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,240
They hope that within three to five years

639
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,520
This time the Japanese are more honest

640
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,000
he gave up last year

641
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,920
because they found

642
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,600
Now the score is about the middle and lower grades

643
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,840
I just can't get into that public university

644
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,560
Probably private universities can be admitted

645
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,880
but the computer you need to know

646
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,840
he is very rambunctious

647
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,200
because he never forgets

648
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,520
all historical geography

649
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,880
remember everything clearly

650
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,640
so you test him

651
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,320
But there is one thing he must lose

652
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,280
But his current method is difficult to break through

653
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,360
so he thinks

654
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,480
this is probably hopeless

655
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
the successful case

656
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,960
It's all this commercial company

657
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,480
IBM Sunland beats the king of western gas

658
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,400
1997

659
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
At that time they were

660
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,840
It is assumed that this game of Go may be 50 years later

661
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,080
will defeat

662
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Because the maintenance complexity may be tens of millions of times

663
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That IBM Watson Beats the Jeopardy Champion

664
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Jeopardy is a simple question answering system

665
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
so he might ask if you are the winner of the physics prize in 1998

666
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Who is it? Questions like this

667
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That's about speed

668
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
so the computer

669
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We all thought he was voice input at first

670
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
then just like people

671
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
actually not

672
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Later he was rambunctious

673
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He means the examiner

674
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's the show host

675
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
when starting to read the topic

676
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
He just presses a key to put the text

677
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Already written text questions

678
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
send to computer

679
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
So the computer has five or six seconds

680
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
He can calculate while reciting the title

681
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
In this case he will press the button

682
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
will be faster than people

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So this is a bit unreasonable

684
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The way IBM wins

685
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
actually

686
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
really a big project

687
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
He spent 25 engineer

688
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
are very advanced

689
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
IBM engineer

690
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
five years

691
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
plus there is

692
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Many schools cooperate with him

693
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Then what

694
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
every question asked

695
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
He'll have 100 different systems

696
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
to come up with an answer

697
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
some systems

698
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It is the kind of confidence that is relatively high

699
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Some systems are lower

700
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
he will just vote

701
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
He'll find out the answer

702
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
he didn't use

703
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
the way we call understanding

704
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
naa fago

705
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
This is really quite powerful

706
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Google AFAGO

707
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's not Google's own

708
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Also bought the one from the UK

709
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
a company

710
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Then Google and do it again

711
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
beat korean flag

712
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Go back to Banner King

713
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
deep learning

714
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
this is part

715
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and many other tricks

716
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But the way he and humans set the flag

717
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
very different

718
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
all of us

719
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Teacher Xu Zhansheng

720
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
He is making a banner

721
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Then he every week

722
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
will invite a Xiangqi Master

723
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
come talk to him for an hour

724
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I use my old man to purchase

725
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
this

726
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He said every flag of the master

727
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
considering

728
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
Two or three possible moves, why so few

729
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,260
That is to say, when ordinary people play chess

730
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,920
90% impossible to win the paper

731
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,520
you don't even think about it

732
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,560
just don't watch at all

733
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,960
But the master is 99%

734
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,520
Even 99.9% he won't consider

735
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,860
so you can see in

736
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,660
Some parks have a really good camera operator

737
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,760
He can play with 10 people at the same time

738
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,600
He walked to the second place after he got off.

739
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,860
Just get off the chair and walk back like this

740
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,620
The first one hasn't been downloaded yet

741
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,180
It means only thinking about the actual species every time

742
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,860
Because you want to think about where the other party might go next

743
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,860
So there are quite a few steps here and there.

744
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,160
So in this case you consider two or three possibilities

745
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,060
You can't remember all this in your head

746
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,660
So the great thing is

747
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,560
These masters with such a small head

748
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,060
Calculations are so slow and memory is so poor

749
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,460
How could he be in such a fast time

750
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,060
Just finish thinking about this actual possibility

751
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Many untimely directions have been automatically deleted in the previous life

752
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,200
Our feeling is that the result of his talk with the master is that someone actually memorized a lot of patterns

753
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,400
like you say it like so many of your old photos

754
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,600
You don't remember very clearly, but you know where you have been and what movies you have been looking for

755
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,200
There is a similar experience in the next issue

756
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
After downloading, he will have many such patterns left behind.

757
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,600
These patterns can help him do a quick search

758
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,200
I told Mr. Xu Zhuansheng that now Afagou has won against Weiqi

759
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,200
It's Master Vicky, what research can you do now?

760
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,200
He said that in fact, in their direction

761
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,800
This is the current Deep Learning, it is impossible for AFAGO to do it

762
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,000
That is to say, how computers can help people improve, you will scare others

763
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,800
like my pool coach is doing too

764
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,000
You said the world champion pool must be very good

765
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
If we saw him, we would lose confidence

766
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,600
Exercising is boring, it's not like that

767
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,800
I hope that you can make more progress at your current level

768
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,300
so you want a coach

769
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,300
Then this computer plays chess

770
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,000
he can't teach you

771
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He can't explain why he won

772
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,300
So this is actually very little help to us.

773
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,200
What we need is actually a game that is more like a human playing chess.

774
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,800
I'll tell you what's wrong with this step.

775
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,000
see it right away

776
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,500
Such a study is actually relevant to the current

777
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:29,000
All machine learning is Machine Impossible

778
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
at least now i can see that

779
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,500
OK, let me show you a simple

780
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,000
empathetic robot

781
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What does it mean to have everything but ventilation

782
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,500
Here's this sparring system for billiards

783
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,000
Just opposite here is a computer robot

784
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Then you see how good he is

785
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The oil of this machine is its ability, right?

786
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
nothing can kill

787
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I just wanted to say that if he could teach me

788
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Then the coach is out of work, right?

789
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What does it mean that this computer owes Dongfeng now?

790
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
He doesn't know, he doesn't understand my shortcomings

791
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
then what

792
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
He has no so-called strategy concept now

793
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
that he wants to win

794
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Of course it's too easy for him to beat me now

795
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Just because I can't even kill him

796
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
But what he wants to teach me is to

797
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
The meaning of being kind

798
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
where is my shortcoming

799
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
He told me how your knowledge changed

800
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
you can fight whatever you want

801
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
can't do it

802
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,260
So language understanding is generally regarded as the highest level of intelligence

803
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,140
When the robot arrives, if the language ability can be strengthened

804
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,820
Become better at communicating and directing

805
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,020
There are more places that can help manpower

806
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,820
like internet of things

807
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,280
The Internet of Things is actually connecting all the things in the home to the Internet.

808
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
can be strung together

809
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,340
There is also a mark on the milk in the refrigerator

810
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,560
It can know when to buy new milk

811
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,520
What kind of fruit is also on each of them

812
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,480
Sports and leisure

813
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,980
The exercise we just talked about

814
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,820
This table tennis might be the fastest

815
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,960
you want to play tennis

816
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
You don't play with machines at all

817
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Word processing for slow formulas

818
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,940
This is the future administrative secretary should be careful

819
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,440
just a lot of work

820
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,320
Not everything it does can be replaced by a computer

821
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,660
It means that 80% can replace

822
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,500
Now there is only one secretary, it only needs to handle the remaining 20%

823
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,000
So this is a terrible environment

824
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,500
Natural language understanding, let me briefly tell you about it now

825
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,000
It is of course my personal opinion that it needs to be bumpy inside

826
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
If you do learn natural language, we have a colleague here

827
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I probably won't be too convinced after hearing it.

828
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
natural language concepts

829
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
In fact, the concept of natural language is quite vague

830
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
and it's hard to define

831
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Like I said Fascinating Article, right?

832
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This is Fascinating to me

833
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
what you see may be different

834
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
A good way to do it, what does that mean?

835
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
A good tennis player

836
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
This one is more confusing that is

837
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Everyone's ability to play tennis is different

838
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So I say good, maybe others say it is very common

839
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So these words, but we usually speak like this

840
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Do you understand?

841
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
A good student

842
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Then you know what it means, right?

843
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
However, what does it mean to be unwavering

844
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The honest method, the method is actually very difficult

845
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Because have you ever read "Mingfa", "Xingfa" or something?

846
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
A dozen pairs of what corporate law

847
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
you haven't read it, how did you suffer

848
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So, wait a minute, let's talk about

849
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
what these things how we run in the world

850
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
good student

851
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Let's mention that these concepts have their context

852
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
background, the background of this conversation and this context

853
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
allows you to bring this convergence

854
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So if you talk to someone who can't stand it at the train station

855
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Kaohsiung, Taipei, then he will immediately

856
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I almost ask you what time it will be over

857
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You usually don't understand what you say

858
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Therefore, understanding different levels is actually related to many

859
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The question answering system thing is very similar

860
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
some questions may be easy to answer

861
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Answers to some questions may be equivalent to a doctoral or master's thesis

862
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So understanding is the same, some are easy, some are very easy

863
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
What we are interested in today is to talk about the understanding ability required by service robots

864
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
basically he needs to be able to take basic instructions

865
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Then you can have a conversation, it's not easy if you can have a conversation

866
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
like when we often ask questions

867
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Because I went to the bank to ask questions

868
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
don't understand their terminology

869
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
so i talked for a long time

870
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Well, if he is a pilot, he can understand

871
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He just turned it into saying that you want to deposit a fixed deposit, right?

872
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
We didn't know the word fixed deposit, so we talked for a long time

873
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
the same goes for robots

874
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
today you ask a question

875
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Can he narrow down the scope of his problem quickly?

876
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's better to give suggestions

877
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
say like my wife

878
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
his students often

879
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I ask him how to do everything

880
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Then he told him that he would run to that city

881
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
to be able to make suggestions

882
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
This robot can replace that student

883
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
What many of our master students do now

884
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
To be honest, it can really be replaced in the future

885
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,440
Do you want to study for a doctorate in the future, or don't study for a master's degree

886
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,940
computing words words

887
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,480
we think

888
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,400
Computing is to calculate this thing, which seems to be done by a person who is good at mathematics.

889
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,640
But if you look carefully at the following questions, you will find that everyone can do it and very quickly

890
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
why is this

891
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,040
May I ask what is the floating rate of the second-year fixed deposit in US dollars?

892
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,040
This is very clear, right?

893
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,140
Immediately take out this watch from the computer

894
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,840
Two-year float rate here 1.15

895
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,440
If he says one less

896
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,840
May I ask what is the interest rate of the second-year fixed deposit in US dollars?

897
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,840
The customer service will immediately ask him whether the power rate is fixed or floating

898
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,040
How hard is it for a computer to do this today

899
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,240
Or what is the floating rate of the US dollar fixed deposit?

900
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,240
This seldom-speaking second grader will immediately ask back how many months

901
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,440
So today if you say

902
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I want to replace this customer service, as long as I can answer these questions like him

903
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Make up for what is missing

904
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Then why did he know there would be a shortage of these things?

905
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So in fact when you're talking

906
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you talking about a constraint

907
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Then there is a deficiency in this condition, and he will know it immediately

908
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
This man is very powerful

909
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Then you may ask why you can’t talk about the following

910
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What are the benefits of a two-year floating time deposit in US dollars?

911
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Sounds weird that the float runs here

912
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
because every word he has his best friend

913
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
with less good friends, less familiar friends

914
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
when you go to sit at a table outside

915
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You'll find that your best friend is sitting next to you

916
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This float is the best friend of interest rates

917
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
he can't sit next to the sophomore

918
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
then we are on the computer

919
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
In fact, all these things can be calculated

920
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
which things are close to which things

921
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Sometimes order is very important, this is the order just mentioned

922
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,200
jokes from my time

923
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,600
Most of you probably haven't heard of it

924
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,040
there is a foreigner

925
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,200
Americans learn English

926
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,500
No, he learned Chinese and came to Taiwan

927
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,500
when he got off the plane

928
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
he will be a little bit

929
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,200
he just wants to show off

930
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,500
the girl who came to pick up the plane

931
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,400
looks very beautiful

932
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,600
he tensed up

933
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,700
he said against

934
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,100
he was going to talk about you

935
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,700
just the other way around

936
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,500
hello mom

937
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,300
The girl froze for a moment

938
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,600
do not understand at all

939
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,800
Then he didn't see it right

940
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,900
he just thinks about it

941
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,300
He wants to usually say hello to your mother

942
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,000
the girl

943
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,700
just smiled a little

944
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,800
still pretty embarrassing

945
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,300
This man is still wrong

946
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,100
So in the end he figured it must be right

947
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,400
hello mom

948
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,900
So this is such a simple sequence

949
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
when you usually talk

950
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,200
Didn't think about it, didn't think about it, right?

951
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,900
just say it

952
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,900
that's why

953
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,300
very interesting

954
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,300
so you

955
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
must be seen as a language constraint

956
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
In fact, the language has many restrictions

957
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
then why do we know how to say

958
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
In fact, we have a lot of panels in our minds

959
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
You don't even have to think about it to generate these automatically

960
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
will automatically understand what others say

961
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
so today we

962
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
At least the model I made is to learn these Panels

963
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
What about the two-year fixed deposit interest rate in US dollars we asked just now?

964
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
what those things

965
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's a condition

966
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
If you don’t make sense, the conditions are met

967
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
If you don’t make sense, you still have some conditions

968
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
ok

969
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
If your language skills are not good enough

970
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Like the English we just arrived in the United States

971
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
understand every word

972
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
But I don't understand that sentence

973
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It means what is the condition

974
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
what is the meaning of its whole condition

975
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
have no idea

976
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
So elementary school math wheel word problem

977
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It's a very simple quiz

978
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
We're doing language analysis inside

979
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
this is all inside

980
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The so-called least attempted program in elementary school

981
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,900
Everyone knows that computers are now doing these problems

982
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,720
to what extent

983
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,220
Recently at MIT they used machine learning to do this

984
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,780
Average 50 points

985
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:16,140
Even the one who looks like a child will probably get 50 points in the test

986
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,640
get spanked at home

987
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,020
It's just that there is no child who is worse than him in the exam

988
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,800
This sounds simple to us

989
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,900
Xiaomi has two apples

990
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,800
30 kilometers cut two

991
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,420
His difficulty is

992
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,480
He did not sharpen two pencils

993
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,380
fill it in yourself

994
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,160
ate an apple

995
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,280
How many apples does Xiaomi have?

996
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,840
Computers are now equally difficult

997
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,760
After reading this, he doesn't know what you are doing

998
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,640
Xiaohua's father is thirty years older than him

999
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,240
in two years

1000
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,880
His dad is twice his age

1001
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,320
How old is Xiao Hua now?

1002
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,160
It's all a constitutional condition

1003
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,920
So understand quickly

1004
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,360
So the reason why they won't do it

1005
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,880
But because I don't understand this reason

1006
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,400
Then we asked about restaurant tea science, like Siri actually has restaurant tea science,

1007
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,000
We are looking for a meal, what can we get next to the Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall,

1008
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,500
You don't need to ask him, and now you can't,

1009
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,500
That is to say, he can only do voice translation for you now,

1010
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,000
The question is too complicated to answer, that is, he can't make sense,

1011
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,500
He doesn't know whether the conditions for your speech are met or what you want to do,

1012
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,000
So just input these conditions into the computer,

1013
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Computers can answer more things,

1014
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Serial drama this is Cliff Hanger,

1015
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
That is to say, the suspense we just mentioned is the condition of a sentence,

1016
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
You can talk about a story, and a story also has its beginnings and transitions,

1017
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
In the end, what does the so-called successful conclusion of this story mean?

1018
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Even if this person is not married, did that person have a successful relationship in the end?

1019
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
these things

1020
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Cliff Hanger is actually a fulfillment condition,

1021
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Originally, he acted in ten episodes of the American series,

1022
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Taiwan can play 40 episodes,

1023
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,280
He hangs there all the time, and he can add a lot of encryption

1024
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,400
So, computing with words is a very interesting

1025
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,840
That is, you didn’t just say that there is only one sentence, your story also has an ending

1026
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,640
How do you find out this ending

1027
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,960
So if you think about it carefully

1028
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,800
Every sentence we see on the Internet is make sense

1029
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,120
Most people need to make sense when speaking

1030
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,080
So he has some restrictions

1031
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,560
But the literary exception

1032
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,560
Why is literature an exception

1033
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,360
what do you say i'm in a

1034
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,920
cool night

1035
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,760
Walk alone on the beach hill

1036
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,720
Thinking of yesterday's banquet

1037
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,320
There's a lot of this kind of talk that doesn't serve any purpose

1038
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,600
let's not talk now

1039
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,000
Today we are talking about service machinery people

1040
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,680
Including carpet cleaning

1041
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,960
clean the sofa

1042
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,680
This is a very clear instruction

1043
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,080
or turn on the air conditioner

1044
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So these conditions are actually the so-called knowledge

1045
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
If you have this knowledge you will have a way to understand and then you can answer

1046
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Then why is it like the two edges of a calendar sword

1047
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
because you have this knowledge structure

1048
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So when you're dealing with a very complex problem

1049
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
a very complicated sentence you can understand very quickly

1050
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But it also limits human thinking

1051
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
This is when we do research

1052
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
why do you sometimes jump out

1053
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Go to a third party to see why you are doing the right thing

1054
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
For example, the doctor's concept of health is what my wife said.

1055
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
A doctor may see patients for a lifetime

1056
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Say he has a few thousand

1057
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
that number is still very small

1058
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
He has some conclusions, you need to be healthy

1059
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's the fact that we do a lot of these health studies

1060
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Tens of thousands of people have been following them for an unknown number of years before reaching a conclusion

1061
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But most of us rely on his impression

1062
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
so you become more stubborn

1063
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:00,720
Georgian Airlines

1064
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,200
this is for us

1065
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,300
The academicians of Academia Sinica specially remind

1066
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,700
Our academicians often go to various institutes to ask questions

1067
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,600
The question said everyone went up to report, right?

1068
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,000
Some fields are not related to him.

1069
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But he has a lot of insights

1070
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,500
We can't say that what you said is wrong, what?

1071
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,300
can't say that

1072
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,900
So it's very polite

1073
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,600
so

1074
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,000
this is why

1075
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
a sharp blade

1076
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,200
everyone has to be quite humble

1077
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,400
just go to a field

1078
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,800
you are not very familiar

1079
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:31,900
right

1080
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,800
Actually I'm talking about AS

1081
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
I'm also worried

1082
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
That is to say, I may say something that is

1083
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,200
It's totally different from what people say

1084
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,700
So don't believe me all

1085
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,200
this

1086
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,100
This is to draw a Picture

1087
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,100
above this is a

1088
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,000
a young woman

1089
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,800
eyes here nose here

1090
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,600
then wear one

1091
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,800
hat right?

1092
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,900
Did you guys see another image

1093
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,400
This is often psychologically

1094
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,500
some examples

1095
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,700
this is an old woman

1096
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,900
this is her jaw

1097
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,100
the same one

1098
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
If you take the lead and think so, you won't see the other picture

1099
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
We often do this, this is the understanding of an article paragraph

1100
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
This is borrowed from the same article from the teacher Chen Yixin of National Taiwan University.

1101
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
There are some conditions for the understanding of the sentence just mentioned

1102
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
This article paragraph is more complex

1103
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So you guys have to admire yourselves very much

1104
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
When this sentence is finished, you fully understand

1105
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
it's really not easy

1106
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Why? It's unlikely that a computer will do it

1107
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Although the new regulations and documents formulated by ordinary new districts are somewhat crude

1108
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Some are only provisional

1109
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
have a halfway night in practice

1110
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
But this kind of legal system is only related to the practice of economic and social activities

1111
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Well received by domestic investors

1112
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
They think that investing in ordinary new districts is not easy for Changhua.

1113
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Rules and interests can be guaranteed

1114
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
OK, if we want to analyze this

1115
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
This is a formal analysis

1116
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I split the previous words into paragraphs.

1117
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Each punctuation does not count as a paragraph, does it?

1118
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
This is despite the common area

1119
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Some of the latter are supplementary, so they are called parallel

1120
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,600
To be gradually improved, this is a juxtaposition, but a juxtaposition of upper and lower positions, not a parallel

1121
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:14,300
The same is true here, this rule of law is an explanatory way, and then there are several juxtaposed with the following

1122
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:21,940
Then explain it to him, the last is the turning point, the turning point means that in the end he thinks, at the beginning although he said that even though

1123
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:28,880
Although there are a lot of shortcomings, but in the end I think there is still a way

1124
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:35,280
So when we look at it, we can understand it after reading it for a few seconds

1125
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,560
So why can't the computer do it now, ideally he can do it

1126
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,400
Such an exaggerated understanding is very difficult for a computer

1127
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,160
So everyone knows that when it comes to natural language understanding, our human ability is now far beyond that of computers

1128
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,600
but there are many reasons

1129
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,480
In the end, let's talk about what is called technique and what is called a good student at the beginning.

1130
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,280
how to define

1131
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,940
This is my definition, just listen to it

1132
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,440
That is, for each language concept, we assume that there is a corresponding question bank

1133
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,440
That is to say, you think of it as saying that I am going to test a child today

1134
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,240
Or a high school student, what questions are used to test him

1135
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,540
Then this computer passed the same test

1136
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:20,340
If the robot answers through this question bank

1137
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,640
The question bank must be sampled, some each time

1138
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,340
Reaching 70% counts for a few

1139
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,240
So let's say he understands the concept, not that he's 100%

1140
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,180
In fact, we are here, and it is the same when I take the value license test in the United States.

1141
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,480
American Exam Value is next to an examiner's seat

1142
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,840
Then you pass and pass, right?

1143
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,680
He was glad that he was in a good mood that day, and many people had

1144
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,840
Otherwise, many people

1145
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,580
when i go to the exam

1146
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:47,140
I visited Stanford in 1996

1147
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,480
At that time, I had been driving in Taiwan for a long time

1148
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,480
Everyone knows the level of technology in Taiwan

1149
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,580
There must be no problem driving in the US, right?

1150
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,880
But I passed the exam three times

1151
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,980
Because he asked me about you as soon as he got in the car

1152
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,260
Do you know how to drive it? I said it has been open for 20 years

1153
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,640
This sentence alone has already deducted a lot of points from him.

1154
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,960
So in fact, he also has his own problems.

1155
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,400
he picks a few questions

1156
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,080
For example, you make me a Pair of parking

1157
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,680
leather parking or something

1158
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,080
Back into the garage, these things

1159
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,680
it's over if you know

1160
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,600
It's basically not that difficult to understand here

1161
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,800
We are in a general company

1162
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,280
or we in society

1163
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,280
Many things have exam certification

1164
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,080
So as long as we can handle a concept

1165
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,240
relevant knowledge to be able to understand the concept

1166
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,240
In fact, the cram school is doing this.

1167
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,720
Now everyone knows that it is said to take a doctoral program and a master's program

1168
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,720
There are tutoring Ken

1169
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,520
And they say there are about three

1170
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,920
Half of the students are admitted to Ph.D. through cram school

1171
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,920
why? because the teacher is lazy

1172
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,440
It's his archeology question.

1173
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
They also changed

1174
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,600
His question bank is small

1175
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,500
He also knows, so their students can recite it a little

1176
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,500
So let's take care of a concept-related knowledge

1177
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
sometimes it's not that hard

1178
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Let's talk about natural language understanding now

1179
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,500
I just said that it takes a lot of knowledge

1180
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,500
How to acquire this knowledge

1181
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,500
this is the most important point

1182
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,500
The foundation of natural language understanding is knowledge

1183
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,000
Language is the most important power to record knowledge

1184
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So learn from the language

1185
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Language knowledge is divided into two parts

1186
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
one is the rule

1187
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
For example, a rule of word formation

1188
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,500
What are the sentence patterns? Chinese Grammar

1189
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,500
belongs to this

1190
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
The advantage of this rule is that

1191
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Our Chinese is subject verb object

1192
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
This structure is most frequently

1193
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
so you swap anything

1194
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,500
become something else

1195
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Using this rule may be a legitimate argument

1196
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Although not necessarily meaningful

1197
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,500
That's a lot of imagery experience

1198
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,500
For example, the sentence is fluent

1199
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
When you read it, you think this is very logical, right?

1200
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,000
Chinese medicine, this is even more difficult

1201
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
This is more statistical

1202
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,400
So what we just said

1203
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,400
remember many patterns

1204
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,400
Why learn a native speaker

1205
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,900
He's not good at grammar

1206
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,400
Let's take the old beauty exam

1207
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
He can't pass you in English grammar

1208
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,900
Because we learn English from grammar

1209
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,100
They learned from this ordinary chat

1210
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,400
So he is the impression

1211
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,700
he still knows grammar

1212
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,700
But he doesn't have such a strong sense

1213
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,100
So he is fluent in this aspect

1214
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,400
he is much stronger than you

1215
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,100
the english book he read

1216
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,200
there may be hundreds of copies

1217
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,000
they have counted

1218
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
i.e. a child

1219
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,800
American children from childhood to college

1220
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,300
He learns about ten words a day

1221
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,000
because when he went to college

1222
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,700
Learned more than 300,000 words

1223
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,800
don't remember

1224
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,800
But he really learned so many words

1225
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,700
So our memory is terrible

1226
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,200
The following question is to say

1227
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,800
Well, now the machine is also starting from scratch

1228
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,800
How does he learn from so many materials?

1229
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,900
then you can learn

1230
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
what kind of degree

1231
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
We say that the most abundant textual information on the Internet

1232
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Boundless language, semantic knowledge is indistinguishable from the text

1233
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
This is for people to see

1234
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So in human terms you probably

1235
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
We are now reading slowly because of reading

1236
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Otherwise we can gain a lot of knowledge

1237
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Then as far as the machine is concerned these are symbols

1238
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Like the word Chen Shi

1239
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and cuteness are two symbols

1240
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
where is the meaning

1241
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
this is very difficult

1242
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
If you find that it uses ham try

1243
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
These are very challenging questions

1244
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Google everyone knows

1245
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
The recent Google translation is much better than before

1246
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Just thanks to Deep Learning

1247
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
is the new machine learning of deep learning

1248
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But the principle of its translation is

1249
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Rely on many bilingual parallel intonations

1250
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
For example, we now have many

1251
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Chinese to English

1252
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Or translate English into Chinese

1253
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
We have a lot of semantic information

1254
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Already included in this translation

1255
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,280
so it goes to see

1256
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,720
memorize this translation

1257
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,120
Didn't I just talk about the phonetic conversion?

1258
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,480
You go to memorize that Windows

1259
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,880
If you finish memorizing the seven characters in rhyme

1260
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,960
your ability is very strong

1261
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,640
a little harder to translate

1262
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,320
because it has an order that changes

1263
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,600
So most if the order remains the same

1264
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,960
It actually flips pretty well

1265
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,480
That first Google translation

1266
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,360
actually simpler

1267
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,240
Not using Deep Learning

1268
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,800
It is an Algorithm written by one person

1269
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,680
Because at that time the key point of the translation was to say

1270
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,400
It has about 30 languages ​​in the world

1271
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,600
There are always people who need to turn over and over again.

1272
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,760
Of course, the translation to English is the most frequent

1273
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,000
Then these 30 languages

1274
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,960
Both have information about the counterpart in English

1275
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,040
So there's a lot of these data out there

1276
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,200
So this guy wrote an Algorithm

1277
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,200
How to use statistical methods for translation

1278
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,480
don't understand at all

1279
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,840
Just use statistics to find out

1280
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,000
After the translation, there are 35 languages

1281
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,280
translated into 35 languages

1282
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,480
all can each other

1283
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,600
very fast

1284
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,200
whether it is good or not is another matter

1285
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,200
It's doing better now

1286
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,200
So learning the language of these online

1287
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,200
There are two ways

1288
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,200
One is Rule Base

1289
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,200
In the early stage, before 1990, the Rule Base model was the main model.

1290
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,000
different knowledge

1291
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,200
First divide it into clusters and categories

1292
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Then write the relevant rules for each class

1293
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,700
The same class is more like and easier to write

1294
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,400
The advantage is that its true or false examples are relatively easy to figure out why

1295
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,900
As we did knowledge law the earliest

1296
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,100
At that time also Rule Base

1297
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,900
So when it's wrong you can know right away why

1298
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,500
The system is more stable

1299
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,900
easy to handle this particular case

1300
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,400
Then suitable for inference operations

1301
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,900
Almost all large-scale systems in the industry are Rule Base

1302
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,500
because you are in industry

1303
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,700
you make a system

1304
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,300
you tell the boss this

1305
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:53,900
this is wrong

1306
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,900
If you know your mistakes, you can make amends

1307
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,100
It will be corrected tomorrow

1308
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,900
Rule BaseDo it

1309
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,100
if you do it in another way

1310
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
The disadvantage is that the rules are written by humans, which is very labor-intensive

1311
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
The subjective consciousness of different people is very different, and the rules of writing will conflict

1312
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And people can cover a limited range

1313
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
All of us have a teacher Su Keyi, he does machine translation

1314
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
He is really doing it, he used to run a company outside

1315
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
His machine translation first used Rubber Bass

1316
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Encountered a problem, the first

1317
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,000
He hired quite a few linguists and often quarreled

1318
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
He said I made him right, and you made him bad, you write one, you talk about me

1319
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
What about this?

1320
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
He later said that he fires a linguist every time

1321
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
He improves accuracy

1322
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:53,000
He said that it is best for a company to be written by one person, and there will be no quarrel

1323
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Well, there are some companies now

1324
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,740
His general manager is his earliest Founder is a weak person

1325
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,940
He said I would never be FIRE

1326
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,560
Because if he leaves, his company will collapse

1327
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,680
conflicts between rules

1328
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:16,040
Like Microsoft they are doing Cortena

1329
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,240
The same goes for voice assistants

1330
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,740
he can answer questions

1331
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,600
He's doing about 12 fields now

1332
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,600
Traveling, what about ordering food?

1333
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,100
or this

1334
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,100
Meteorology, and constellations

1335
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,900
But every time he wants to add a new field, it will be troublesome

1336
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,900
Because of this new field added problems

1337
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,900
knowledge

1338
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,600
will conflict with the previous

1339
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,600
So he will steal other people's problems

1340
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,600
It's very troublesome to grab and grab

1341
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,600
So this is if being the biggest problem

1342
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,100
then let me give an example

1343
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,100
This is difficult to standardize in English literature

1344
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,100
That is to say, you are behind the English paper

1345
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,100
There are references

1346
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,400
Inside the author and title journal, one is drawn out

1347
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
This is followed by Volume issue, Pace number

1348
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,400
To extract one, you have to write a lot of rules

1349
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,400
sorry, drink some water

1350
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,400
it's exactly an hour

1351
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:32,400
Then the first Rule means that the Volume needs to be shaved, and Esho will shave again.

1352
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,400
All good, write one every time you encounter a different situation

1353
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:47,400
OK, this is the basic Rule. After Volume, you need to vaccinate and shave, then come to Esho, and then come to something

1354
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,400
it is written as a rule

1355
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,400
The parameter is also different for active learning, it uses the plot rate or the gold-like network to learn

1356
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:00,400
The current mainstream language processing technology is these two

1357
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It mainly replaces this problem with a mathematical optimization problem

1358
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Optimization is having an objective with a number of

1359
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Then you input this one input later

1360
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
it is right and wrong it can learn

1361
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Statistical models need to do a lot of feature engineering

1362
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
But for deep learning it is less necessary

1363
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But it needs a lot of data to train

1364
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
In fact, most deep learning

1365
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
probably in the company

1366
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Only big companies can do well

1367
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
This is known as a high degree of automation

1368
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
In fact, the preparation of the previous materials is very labor-intensive.

1369
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
It didn't mention this

1370
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
The disadvantage is that these three shortcomings are probably difficult for ordinary companies to accept

1371
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
results are unpredictable

1372
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Let's say you added some new training knowledge

1373
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
it might be wrong with some old ones

1374
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
it has no way of explaining why it's good

1375
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
If we know our mistakes, we can correct them

1376
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
it is hard to change

1377
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Why do many big companies not change

1378
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
he is willing to use

1379
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,800
So he usually treats those with higher frequency

1380
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,200
relatively high accuracy

1381
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,200
otherwise lower

1382
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,200
So there are some special cases that he can't handle at all.

1383
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,640
long distance relationship

1384
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,400
Those are relatively low frequency

1385
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,800
is also difficult to deal with

1386
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,800
the hardest thing is to say

1387
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,400
He has a bottleneck in accuracy

1388
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,400
He can't make it up to more than one level

1389
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,800
Because you have a lot of very detailed knowledge, he can't use it

1390
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,800
So we draw a very simple graph

1391
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,000
Parametric machine learning is a black box job

1392
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So he has a window to see the kitchen

1393
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Then the back of the entrance is where you can see what he does.

1394
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,200
be more at ease

1395
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,200
Glassbox

1396
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,200
Let's show you now

1397
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,000
Some examples of deep learning used in machine translation

1398
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,600
Even he doesn't talk about understanding

1399
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,600
He just made the translation as good as he thought it would be

1400
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,600
But this so-called best has a frequency standard

1401
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,600
not for ordinary people

1402
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,600
This is a translator to understand personnel

1403
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
what do you think, with considerable difficulty

1404
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
This English is better, you can see

1405
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
這個不 make sense to understand how people want to have considerable difficulty

1406
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
just don't write anything, right?

1407
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That's a better way

1408
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
to understand how people think is very difficult

1409
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Then below is I ask my secretary to take down the telephone number

1410
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I asked my secretary and took down the phone number

1411
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
This is a mistake, not to ask the secretary

1412
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Good translation is I ask the secretary to take down this phone number

1413
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So his, in fact, turned over with a plan and a concession

1414
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Most of this is true, but because he doesn't understand

1415
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
So those words together don't make sense

1416
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
再來說 I ask my secretary to take down the letter

1417
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
This is to test him on purpose, he will definitely not

1418
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
i asked my secretary to take the letter

1419
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
In fact, he means in Chinese that I dictate this letter and ask the secretary to write it down

1420
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
This is the correct English meaning

1421
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,860
下面是Big Trucks are forbidden in this road to make room for small cars

1422
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:10,460
Big trucks banned on this road to make room for smaller cars

1423
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:14,300
Is there any reference value for him?

1424
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,660
Probably not even reference value

1425
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,660
Generally speaking, there is a reference value, and if I miss a word or two, I will correct it, right?

1426
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,660
If he has to rewrite this, he doesn't need to rewrite it at all.

1427
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:26,660
A better translation is that big trucks are not allowed on this road and small cars are allowed to pass

1428
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,660
This is more like people

1429
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,660
If you understand this sentence, it's okay if you don't speak fluently.

1430
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,660
But sometimes you mean the wrong thing

1431
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:38,660
If you don't understand English today and you need to translate it, it will be very troublesome

1432
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,660
So we use the following example to talk about unified self-selection

1433
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:43,660
Taipei is a child smuggled

1434
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,660
I’ve read it today, don’t read the following, you’ll probably understand it right away

1435
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,660
But in fact there are many words below

1436
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:51,660
I'm omitting the part of the word now, just the word

1437
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:55,660
Taipei City Taipei City one by one

1438
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,660
There are many possibilities, right?

1439
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,660
But there is only one meaningful combination

1440
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,600
And what you are hearing is the 11 children in Taipei

1441
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,960
the part that is red

1442
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,240
I didn't hear anything else

1443
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,640
Actually not heard

1444
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,760
You are the same master as Xia Qi

1445
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,680
You are 99% enumerated by you

1446
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,560
You quickly find out that doesn't work

1447
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,320
So his homophonic choice

1448
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,520
That is, each one is an input sound

1449
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,080
Then there are single-character and two-character words below

1450
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,320
he doesn't know which one you want to choose

1451
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,440
So you use a mathematical model to calculate

1452
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,000
In the end you may choose the yellow one

1453
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,440
not necessarily right

1454
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,280
Then it depends on whether your mathematical model is well written.

1455
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,520
Now let's see where the difficulty of this problem lies.

1456
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,560
the pattern recognition

1457
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,040
On the choice of homophonic system

1458
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:39,840
I hit one

1459
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,480
The phonetic book in Taiwan also needs to be toned

1460
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:44,600
right

1461
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,000
Then I just talked about five to fifteen unisons

1462
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,360
The mainland is silent

1463
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,760
the one it triples

1464
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,480
Three times as many words is fifteen to forty-five word possibilities

1465
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,440
so this is the doctor

1466
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,840
All Physicians Gotta Get It All Right

1467
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,100
very many homophones and words

1468
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,560
It is not necessarily a statement, some are homonyms

1469
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,980
There are still a lot of grabbing words, and the grabbing words are next to it

1470
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,040
Like this is the lion, sent to the hospital, the market, what kind of toothpaste

1471
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,360
So when you beat the doctor down

1472
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,800
You have to do it right, not him right, everything next to him has to be right

1473
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,360
a whole bunch of restrictions like this

1474
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,200
So we just said that the seven-character Window can be memorized like this

1475
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,520
It's possible to solve this problem

1476
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,520
It's a pity that we humans are not very creative in speech

1477
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:39,720
Everything we say is written into a certain paragraph of text.

1478
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:44,320
Let me give you an example to show you the homonym context

1479
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,640
We used to do smart calligraphy as well

1480
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,680
dermatology, so we'll write

1481
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,760
If the front is dermatology, internal medicine, cancer

1482
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,960
The latter subject is river fighting, right?

1483
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,560
Then the doctor's words are Muge Branch

1484
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,240
if there is an after

1485
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,280
bump into dermatology

1486
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
If you are a nuclear medicine doctor, the two should be discussed together

1487
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
This nuclear cool medical score is a little higher than his

1488
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
But if I say the following, you will be miserable

1489
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
To treat this kind of allergic skin, physicians only have experience

1490
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
This is the saying, if you don’t know how to do it, you will do it wrong

1491
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
You just use points, one high and one low, you will definitely not be able to do it

1492
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Because there are tens of thousands of my way of speaking, it is impossible to do it right

1493
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So we now propose that what we just talked about is that

1494
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
What others have done, we now propose a way

1495
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We believe it is a very simple one

1496
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And that's what I just said about using Pattern Recognition

1497
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Pattern Recognition, we think that language learning is basically Pattern Matching

1498
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
When people see the difference between machines, they will generate it when they learn

1499
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
More abstract Patterns will be remembered

1500
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
In this way, if I learn one sentence, I may be able to watch many dramas and understand many sentences

1501
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Like this below, Hon Hai Foxconn Technology Group

1502
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,500
Shenzhen division of labor, this is just an organization name

1503
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,540
will produce smart machines

1504
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,000
If I knew it was an institution when I read it

1505
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
This sentence is very simple, isn't it?

1506
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
This is followed by the name of a gene

1507
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,640
incase tumor necrosis factor receptor

1508
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,000
partner factor

1509
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,500
The words of this man who doesn't understand life

1510
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,000
Absolutely impossible to know that this is a gene

1511
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,500
Now it's time to teach the computer to read all this

1512
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,000
How much knowledge is needed

1513
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,000
The following is the relationship extraction

1514
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Like MIRNA induced atopsis targeting BCl2

1515
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,500
Only biological people can't read this

1516
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,000
Now we ask the computer to say

1517
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,500
it needs to be able

1518
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,500
It used to be said that a computer should be able to operate in a very harsh environment

1519
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,500
nothing to be afraid of going swimming

1520
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,000
Now that's bad too

1521
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
It's just that most of the creatures can't read.

1522
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,500
to be able to read him

1523
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Then extract the relation

1524
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,500
question category

1525
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,000
like does anyone know

1526
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
This fragrant tree duck restaurant in Tainan

1527
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
This is our test robot

1528
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
will you understand

1529
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,140
What are the must-eat foods in Taipei?

1530
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,440
near MRT station

1531
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,440
will you understand

1532
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:08,240
I can't understand now

1533
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,680
There are many other patterns

1534
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,380
let's see now

1535
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,880
Our present model is

1536
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,280
We used to have a dream

1537
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,380
It is pattern matching

1538
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,920
if

1539
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,080
The first rule is written by the machine itself

1540
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,780
And it's flexible when it's right

1541
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,960
Is it possible to apply a rule we just talked about to be

1542
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:31,320
One is the Impressionist Statistical

1543
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,220
Both models kind of all fit together

1544
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,960
high automation

1545
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,260
Accuracy is highly interpretable

1546
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,760
easy to explain is important

1547
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,560
Let us now look at the phenomenon of language

1548
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,860
what kind of

1549
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,300
In fact, everyone knows

1550
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,700
Is the spelling checker in English correct?

1551
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:49,200
It's because you mistyped an English word

1552
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,040
he immediately

1553
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,240
especially now on mobile

1554
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,140
all playing

1555
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,440
Wrong two and he'll correct you, right?

1556
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,320
So this Jinshi comparison actually existed very early.

1557
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,080
is there a way to replace this

1558
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It's just what I said, happy three, happy four, or some more boring words

1559
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Now we humans will not be affected at all, we can all understand

1560
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Like when we do voice input, there are many RRRs in the middle

1561
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
We can automatically tune these sounds of the drum position, as if we heard them or not

1562
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
What we do now is actually the same as printing me with this word

1563
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Automatically group these patterns with similarities and differences, and then find a representative

1564
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Use these representatives to compare

1565
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
This we call the principle-based approach

1566
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Already applying for a patent

1567
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Then this principle-based approach only needs to use a small number of principles

1568
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
This principle is a bit like RRR, but its advantage is that it is automatically written

1569
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And its match comparison is very flexible

1570
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Let's use a few examples to see the power of using this principle-match

1571
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Like Chinese addresses, we used to write rules to ensure that

1572
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
If I want to make a computer software now

1573
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Mark all the addresses written on the Internet

1574
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
how much effort it takes

1575
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
He skipped this one, sorry

1576
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
OK, I'll skip this paragraph first

1577
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It is the number of this pattern of the address

1578
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Generally, when you go out to write the mutual gathering address, this is probably how you write it.

1579
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Shidaan District, Taipei, Shidaan District, Central East, right?

1580
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
not revealing

1581
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
But we know that addresses are often not

1582
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
no write zone

1583
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So this time you may have another address like this

1584
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Sometimes you will add another Dongyang East Taxi No. 17 Shidaan in the center of Taipei

1585
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
This plus these things is very harmful to the weak quilt

1586
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Because it is written behind it, it must be connected to the road or connected to the area

1587
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
then you are not at all

1588
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
so you hook this thing up

1589
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
But speaking from someone who has tried it, this is not a problem at all

1590
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
One point is that it is the same as the R2 we mentioned, it will turn green immediately

1591
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,960
So now when we make a computer, we must be able to put these things that should be placed or can be omitted.

1592
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,960
all can be learned

1593
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,240
Like ours, we know it by means of statistics

1594
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:16,200
So now the rules we wrote in the past probably need thirty or forty rules.

1595
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,480
Because I don't know if you start from Taipei or from Da'an District

1596
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,440
Then I don't know if you end up with number or None or something

1597
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,680
So write a bunch of rules

1598
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:29,880
Now only one Pattern is needed to calculate all the additions and subtractions

1599
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:35,560
Then this is the best speech recognition test

1600
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,440
You can't say Google Siri right now

1601
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:44,040
That is to say, it mainly pairs the word with the noun that follows it.

1602
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:48,200
Flowers should be matched with this wooden signature, and signatures should be matched with this word

1603
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:57,600
So here I used to do natural calligraphy because I spent a lot of effort to get it right

1604
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It's very hard to write, I don't know how many bettors

1605
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Then once this academician came to test

1606
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
This academician is very smart, he added a posture after the posture

1607
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Immediately the system is all wrong

1608
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Another academician made him cute and pottery

1609
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
A very pompous approach

1610
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
So these systems are written cleanly

1611
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
It is connected to this behind the bathing pool, connected to this

1612
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
can't just add

1613
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Delation I don’t want all the cute ones

1614
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Don't do anything, see if you're right

1615
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Now we basically know all of these

1616
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
We now only need to write a Pattern

1617
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Digit Quantity Agit

1618
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Because we already know that these other added Janes

1619
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
It's the same as those addresses just now

1620
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Your noun bath pool you can write two or three

1621
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Write something very cute on the front

1622
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
whatever you write will be right

1623
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
So it only has one Pattern and it will all be solved for you

1624
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
A lot of English literature we just talked about

1625
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,260
It happens that writing a thousand rules is not enough

1626
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:05,380
Everyone knows English literature on the Internet

1627
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,900
it has the standard wording

1628
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,260
the same document

1629
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:09,940
you can write it in many different ways

1630
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,700
Can you guess how many spellings there are?

1631
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,340
i will give you a number now

1632
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:20,160
Raise your hand if you think the approximate number is correct

1633
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,200
100 different spellings

1634
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,280
like this are different ways of writing

1635
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,560
What is the cap number and the bean number is written differently

1636
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,560
Raise your hand if you guess 100

1637
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
1000's

1638
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
good 5000

1639
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
strangeness

1640
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
How many people think the rest

1641
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
10,000

1642
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
OK thank you

1643
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
The answer is more than 8600

1644
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Just such a simple document

1645
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
More than 8600 kinds

1646
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So if you're going to learn

1647
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
this will be dead

1648
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Our current approach is very simple, just write a lot of rules here, so a thousand is not enough, right?

1649
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:14,000
We are very simple now, we know what can be connected behind this volume 38,

1650
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You can pick up something on the left side of the issue and memorize it. This can be done with statistics, and there is no need for that person to take care of it.

1651
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
The same is true, issue and page number, what can be added in the middle, remember it with statistics,

1652
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Then we only have one pattern, which is VIP, volume issue, and page number, and include all of these,

1653
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
This method is also the same, just like the address just now, because I am the same, a principle,

1654
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Let's compare the error rate with the best active learning, CRF, because the accuracy is already very high,

1655
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
So in reverse, our error is 0.5, which is 99.5% right,

1656
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:59,000
That's a little better, it's 98.8%, the page here is much better, what are these, standard learning,

1657
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Two thousand articles to test

1658
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
there are other testing agencies

1659
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Our performance at each testing agency

1660
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Performance is almost the same

1661
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
The last level is actually the hardest

1662
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It's called FreeStar

1663
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
FreeStar what

1664
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Many researchers from our Academia Sinica

1665
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
The book that was written after him wrote down

1666
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Because when our researchers wrote

1667
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
They all miss three and miss four, right?

1668
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
then that

1669
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
He can understand you can understand

1670
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
But the computer can't understand

1671
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So you go to use this more formal study

1672
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
He is very wrong

1673
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Error force fast to 10

1674
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
OSA is approaching 10

1675
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
TITLE is 28.9

1676
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Journal and everything are messed up

1677
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
After he has learned the standard

1678
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Run these tests in general

1679
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
But our system basically handles very high

1680
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
It's almost as accurate as the original

1681
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
So this way

1682
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Like what's in Taipei Social Home Center

1683
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,400
I don't care if you join me or not

1684
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,400
It's easy to learn a lot

1685
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,900
then this can

1686
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,600
Everyone, just say anything

1687
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,600
I can show you thirty or forty possibilities

1688
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,600
The distance between the two places is from Taipei to Kaohsiung

1689
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,100
say 360 kilometers

1690
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:18,500
360 kilometers from Taipei to Kaohsiung

1691
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,800
Or 360 kilometers from Taipei to Kaohsiung

1692
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,300
do not write yes ah do not write what

1693
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,500
How many kilometers is the distance between Taipei and Kaohsiung?

1694
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,100
actually mean the same thing

1695
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,700
then if you are

1696
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,800
Go online and answer these questions

1697
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,300
it is written slightly differently

1698
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:37,400
You're going to write the rules, you can't finish

1699
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,000
So our final conclusion is that

1700
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,600
It's just P1

1701
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,000
The first location, the second location and the description of the distance

1702
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,400
The distance between images and the distance value

1703
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,700
These few will never change

1704
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:52,200
It doesn't matter if it can be mapped or deleted

1705
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,100
The second way of writing is that you write the distance in the middle

1706
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,700
Probably only these two patterns

1707
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,000
describe all the relationships

1708
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,500
For example, when we actually do it, put this Pattern

1709
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,500
Can automatically Summarize out

1710
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:08,380
It's not written by humans, it's written by computers

1711
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:11,580
Then it is very easy to compare

1712
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:14,280
So let's now look at the smart agent application

1713
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,780
12 minutes left

1714
01:19:15,780 --> 01:19:18,780
Talk about some of the more important applications of this

1715
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,540
Smart Classification System

1716
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:22,980
Now our mail

1717
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,740
Emails you have received

1718
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,980
Usually we do that in Zhongyuanyuan

1719
01:19:26,980 --> 01:19:27,980
or on Google

1720
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,480
will remove SpamMail first

1721
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,980
Then SpamMail has many methods of Detect

1722
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,480
But I usually pick up the phone or

1723
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,480
I didn't read it for a while and wrote 100 new letters

1724
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,980
I can't accept it, right?

1725
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:44,480
What is the email system we want?

1726
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,480
It can put this important and urgent Email at the top

1727
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,980
For example, there are five

1728
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:52,980
For example, the vice president's office called you

1729
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:53,980
This is very important

1730
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,980
this is one of them

1731
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,980
So if the computer reads it, it will be placed in the five envelopes immediately.

1732
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
that's enough for me

1733
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I'm short on time

1734
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I can only read a few

1735
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I saw those five

1736
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
can be dealt with immediately

1737
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
down may be a second tier

1738
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
third floor fourth floor

1739
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
it can follow these

1740
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
your own way

1741
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Categorize this email

1742
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
must go at this time

1743
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
read that email content

1744
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
understand

1745
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
After understanding to a certain extent

1746
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
There is no way to classify

1747
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
There is also this automatic off-script recovery

1748
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
There are many emails

1749
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
For example, ask you when

1750
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
What kind of meeting can I have?

1751
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
wrote a lot

1752
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Finally there is a table

1753
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
let you lick right

1754
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
then you already have one

1755
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Google's calendar is over there

1756
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
You are Google Calendar

1757
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
are you going to find it yourself?

1758
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Just tell the computer to find it yourself

1759
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
See if I have time

1760
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
just fill it back

1761
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
so later these

1762
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
is the appointment

1763
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
It's just things like fixed grains.

1764
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
can be automatically read by computer

1765
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Automatic recovery

1766
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
don't need a secretary

1767
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
This one is more difficult

1768
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
automated scoring system

1769
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Ministry of Science and Technology Program

1770
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Ministry of Science and Technology is now a year

1771
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
There may be hundreds of thousands of plans

1772
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
go in

1773
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,380
This suggestion is not from me, but from the Executive Yuan

1774
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,620
A certain official said, he said it cost too much money

1775
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,820
Send a plan every time

1776
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:12,360
A plan needs to be sent to three people for review

1777
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,120
2000 yuan per person

1778
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,800
So a plan is six thousand

1779
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,500
Those hundreds of thousands of projects add up to billions

1780
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,460
This is the first trial and the deputy judge has not yet arrived. The deputy judge is

1781
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,560
It was also sent to some more famous scholars for review

1782
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,400
Is there any way for this to be like TOEFL composition?

1783
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,560
automatic scoring

1784
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,900
TOEFL Essay Now Has Two Scores

1785
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,360
One is a human call, the other is a computer call

1786
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:39,760
computer, because it is roughly divided into six levels

1787
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,660
six levels, it has had a lot of examples before

1788
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:45,360
What kind of composition is at which level

1789
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,460
So now the computer can do a classification

1790
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,660
It's a new composition

1791
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:51,960
It puts you in the most likely tier

1792
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,760
score decides

1793
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,960
If this score is similar to that of others

1794
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,660
it's over

1795
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:59,160
it saves a lot of effort

1796
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,160
about three percent

1797
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,360
95% of the cases are passed

1798
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,900
There are a few 5% cases

1799
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,020
If the scores are too far apart

1800
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,100
find someone else to fight

1801
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,660
Just save Raleigh

1802
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:10,760
So the Ministry of Science and Technology plans to do the same?

1803
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,220
province alone

1804
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,120
Then a computer saves

1805
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,900
then the score is very close

1806
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,220
Just pass

1807
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,660
How many billions of dollars can this save the country?

1808
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,660
Then the essay province

1809
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,020
Papers we are now saving

1810
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:26,020
Like all of our resources in a journal

1811
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,160
English periodicals

1812
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,700
1,000 papers submitted each year

1813
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,420
In the end less than 5% were accepted

1814
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:34,860
95% were rejected

1815
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,860
Nor can the computer be used for a preliminary review

1816
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:41,420
Don't even look at the 50%

1817
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,020
you can reject

1818
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,260
Write a very simple English is not fluent

1819
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,420
or what kind of case

1820
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,160
He can read this

1821
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:49,800
resume selection

1822
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,420
Now we have trouble finding a job

1823
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,760
resume to which company

1824
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,360
The company picks up

1825
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,420
Like that big company, there are tens of thousands of letters

1826
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,620
he can't read

1827
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,920
He wants to say there is a form

1828
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,760
Then he uses that data base for everything

1829
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,160
But most people don't like that

1830
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,960
OK, what about the rating systems?

1831
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:11,040
most can use computer

1832
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,080
The same is true for recommendation systems, product recommendation

1833
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,760
Now you want to buy an air conditioner

1834
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,920
What kind of form do you like?

1835
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,040
what is quiet or what

1836
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,440
A lot of descriptions are finished

1837
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,440
they recommend you right away

1838
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,640
Then this recommendation system does not mean

1839
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,360
The manufacturer said his air conditioner is very quiet

1840
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,960
I went to many blogs to read

1841
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:31,680
Say what these people said about this air conditioner

1842
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,920
collect him all

1843
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,560
Then hit a new score

1844
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,560
so it's very complicated

1845
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,600
this type of ad

1846
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:39,360
future ads

1847
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,720
We watch a lot of movies on that internet now

1848
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:47,520
In particular, many serial machines in mainland China have already been installed.

1849
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,480
He is not afraid of your computer now

1850
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,040
Because you watch TV and watch commercials

1851
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,080
The computer also sees advertisements

1852
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,320
So he thinks there is no difference

1853
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,080
That part of the ad cannot be omitted

1854
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,280
You can't press it no matter what

1855
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,000
he kept talking

1856
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Now the advertisements are the same as those on TV, everyone sees the same advertisement

1857
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:14,000
If he's smarter in the future, his ad, you've changed seasons recently and want to buy some clothes or your shoes are broken

1858
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:22,000
If he knows, he will put some things you really like, and the style is based on the shoes you bought before for a comparison

1859
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
That ad, you saw it and immediately went out to buy it, or bought it online

1860
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It is very meaningful to recommend

1861
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Intelligent teaching assistant agent and health system

1862
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:42,000
IBM's WATCHEN is to push his entire system to Medical Science

1863
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:49,000
We are now talking about assistant teaching assistants. In fact, we did it a long time ago, but because we are not very smart

1864
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So 24 hours is not used by so many people

1865
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Future teaching assistants, we just finished, have to be very smart

1866
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,800
Teaching assistant agent Math assistant agent

1867
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,160
If the elementary school mathematics just now

1868
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:05,000
you can get 90 points

1869
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
or 95 points

1870
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Everyone can be a teaching assistant

1871
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:10,400
but you also need to understand

1872
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,400
There is also a question answering system

1873
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,800
Can understand the meaning of questions that students don't understand

1874
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,000
can help him explain

1875
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,400
I think this is the greatest help for all children

1876
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,400
English and Mathematics

1877
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,300
This is medically related

1878
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:27,500
it's big

1879
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,500
the university wrote a

1880
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,200
A description of a patient's condition

1881
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,200
Jennifer States

1882
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,500
what we have to do is

1883
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:39,000
Computer poison to all Risk Factor

1884
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,100
remember it

1885
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,000
Then put all the Medication

1886
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,500
he

1887
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,300
what did the doctor prescribe

1888
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,500
Or what medicine did he take to remember it

1889
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:53,700
Then he went to do the quality of the health check

1890
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:54,500
pick him up

1891
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,000
and put it in this

1892
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,100
Put it in and he will know

1893
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,000
What is Connected Risk Factor

1894
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Medical Lyrical Minds, this business literature is growing very fast. Generally, reading or reading papers in many fields is very important, but not as important as Medical Science

1895
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Because everyone in Medical Science knows why it screens out and seeks a higher level, because any one of it, such as doing a certain experiment on a veteran, will be of interest to everyone

1896
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Because it wants to know whether it will have a similar effect if the same experiment is done on humans, so its broadness is very strong

1897
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:40,000
You can’t do it in computer science. If you read the paper in your field in the field of computer science, you probably can’t make a mistake. You can’t understand other things if you want to read them.

1898
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:50,000
As for this aspect, so Medical Science they often say that I have a problem and I want the computer to help me find it. Now if I use Google, it returns tens of thousands of tablets every time.

1899
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Generally speaking, when we search on Google, it doesn’t matter if there are tens of thousands of pieces, because the first ten probably have what I want, bye

1900
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
For example, you need to know which genes are related to a certain disease

1901
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
This may really require hundreds of thousands of papers to read

1902
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Then there are some sentences in him saying that this is very helpful for something

1903
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
You really have to read every sentence.

1904
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,000
So the answer to this kind of question is very difficult.

1905
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Gene-to-Gene Interactions

1906
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And cancer patients, genetic mutations, and methods of diagnosis and treatment

1907
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
People who are sick are very careful

1908
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
can you read soon

1909
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,000
These papers related to him

1910
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Also, what the President of the United States is promoting is not presuci medicine

1911
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It's Personalized Medicine

1912
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
How to collect these data

1913
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
How to do a comparison with your genes

1914
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
It has something to do with the above problems

1915
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
so the answer to any question

1916
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
It may involve really reading so many papers

1917
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It is impossible to have this manpower now

1918
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
impossible in the future

1919
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
So this aspect requires the help of a computer.

1920
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
So life scientists need a comparison

1921
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
has a hundred times more searches

1922
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,280
Here is the end

1923
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:10,140
This has something to do with your work

1924
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:12,140
What does the next issue have to do with doing things?

1925
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:16,060
let's talk first

1926
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:19,060
In fact, many things in society are now hierarchically responsible.

1927
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,060
because you called the travel agency

1928
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,060
Said that I want to go to Pupu Island or Green Island

1929
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,060
Or to Orchid Island

1930
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:26,560
he has not been to these places

1931
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,060
but there are other people beside him

1932
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:29,560
or someone from another company

1933
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,560
He can help you collect information

1934
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,560
tell you what's the fun

1935
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,560
It's up to you to decide whether to go to this place

1936
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,560
When is there a big inspection

1937
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,560
what temperature

1938
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:41,560
Many things are in charge of different people

1939
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,560
So each class works

1940
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,560
data collection

1941
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,560
Decide how the next level of work will be organized

1942
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,560
can do it well

1943
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,560
If all levels make coordinated decisions

1944
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,560
Complete work can go smoothly

1945
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,560
that means

1946
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,560
If the following are all robots

1947
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,560
this is all your work left

1948
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
the coordination and decision making

1949
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,520
if your job

1950
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,520
You can also use the code name of the machine, you don't need to exist

1951
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:07,640
so this is troublesome

1952
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,640
so why is it like playing chess

1953
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,440
Our every decision-making process is very similar to playing chess

1954
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,440
it's your son

1955
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,940
The opponent may play this one

1956
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:17,140
or go somewhere else

1957
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:20,140
So how many steps do you have to consider

1958
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,860
It's possible that if he gets down here

1959
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,360
You go to another place in the second step

1960
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,860
third step

1961
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:28,860
is the step you have to consider

1962
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,860
what's your final decision

1963
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,860
So it's very similar to playing chess

1964
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,860
If you do this every step

1965
01:29:35,860 --> 01:29:37,860
have an agent

1966
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:38,860
agent machine talk to you

1967
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:40,860
If you take this step

1968
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,860
what is his likely success rate

1969
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:44,860
Then such words

1970
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:46,860
you can make a decision soon

1971
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,860
But if there are so many machines

1972
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,860
your job to decide

1973
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:52,860
will be replaced by robots

1974
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,860
So it's slowly

1975
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,860
we are bottom up

1976
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:59,860
OK, parameter setting of the biological laboratory

1977
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Which combination should be tried first

1978
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
that one is the second try

1979
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
You want the computer to make a list

1980
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Then you just have to make a choice

1981
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Then if he has the ability

1982
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Maybe one day he'll tell you

1983
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I've helped you choose the best for this role

1984
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Well, he doesn't need you at all

1985
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
That is to say, in many experiments

1986
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
If he can automate later

1987
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Then we really don’t need to do dry lab today

1988
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Because we told the computer to try it out

1989
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Replace this parameter with that one and run out

1990
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
he may have to run for a day or two

1991
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,000
If you say this action, the computer will do it

1992
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
He can help you to try different parameters

1993
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
If the computer is fast enough

1994
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
These things can be done right now

1995
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Discussion on research direction

1996
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
What method is used which one comes first and which one comes after

1997
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
depth first

1998
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Go down in depth first

1999
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Breadth first go sideways

2000
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Law of success

2001
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So now all we need is to say

2002
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Not a single computer can help us anytime soon

2003
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Calculate these laws of success

2004
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Now in many fields, like in the field of FanX show, they may have it, because he has a lot of data, he can estimate what will happen if you invest in US dollars now

2005
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:18,000
The price of the US dollar has risen in the past two days, should I buy it immediately, or buy it in two days, how to do things in Changhua, how to learn

2006
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
The same is true for this. Didn’t we talk about text comprehension just now?

2007
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:33,000
This computer learns a lot, he can also write, because those sentences come and go, he can add one, but although he can add everything, there is nothing difficult

2008
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
In the future, speeches will be relatively simple, that is, I will write the first few sheets for him to prepare for the exam.

2009
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:45,000
As we said earlier, the exam bot is already preparing the email

2010
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:52,000
The last one is which jobs are easily replaced by robots, which are low-level agent jobs

2011
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:01,000
So everyone, think about it, if you are about to enter the workplace now, I often tell master students, don't think trivial things

2012
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,260
high salary now

2013
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,260
when you turn 40

2014
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:07,760
How much more powerful was the computer than you at that time

2015
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,760
Many people face this choice at the age of 30 or 40

2016
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:11,960
Say he wants to change the line

2017
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:15,460
Because of his line of work, he is already weaker than the newcomers

2018
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,960
Now it is compared with people and later it will be compared with computers

2019
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,160
The work content is simple and repetitive

2020
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,260
like a factory without lights

2021
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,760
I don't need anyone anymore

2022
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,060
simple customer service questions

2023
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:26,860
read simple script

2024
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:28,860
These DTLs are quick to do

2025
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:32,320
The most complex part of every job is still handled by someone

2026
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,320
But there are fewer and fewer people to hire

2027
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,320
we just said

2028
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,320
For example, there may only be 20% of difficult questions in customer service questions

2029
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,820
need real people to answer

2030
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:41,320
But other words don't need

2031
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,320
So like now many banks have more than 200 customer service

2032
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,820
in a few years

2033
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:50,820
We are now going to help banks build an automated answering system

2034
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:54,820
After a few years, he may only need 50, 20 customer service

2035
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,320
real people are answering

2036
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,820
Because simple problems are already

2037
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,480
What Google Designs Now

2038
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,760
Because Google says you type in a question

2039
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,680
It answers in 0.4 seconds after writing on it

2040
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:09,640
In fact, your question has already been asked

2041
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,520
It only needs to search in front of that

2042
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:14,140
How did you shoot this question?

2043
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:16,280
It doesn't need to re-find it for you

2044
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,560
So 90% of the questions are already asked

2045
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,920
That's what we call an FAQ

2046
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,440
no need to search anymore

2047
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,560
The most complex part of every job needs you to deal with

2048
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,320
But if this complexity

2049
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,840
What kind of complexity are we looking at

2050
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,840
If its complexity is only because it has too many possibilities

2051
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,200
Or you have trouble explaining to it

2052
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,480
might as well do it yourself

2053
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,880
In this way, the computer in the future will be faster

2054
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:45,200
like we just said

2055
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,680
You have to run for a day or two with any set of parameters

2056
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:51,880
In the future, the computer may run out for a minute or two

2057
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,240
this is no joke

2058
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:56,960
It's very likely a minute or two to run out

2059
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,100
You can quickly think, you help me run these 100 kinds of parameter groups

2060
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:09,100
Then, after he understands your words, he will run away by himself in the future

2061
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:13,900
He doesn't need you, if he is more considerate, everyone can gradually automate these

2062
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:18,100
So if what a master student does is to try out different possibilities

2063
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:22,400
But the teacher will tell him a direction, which is more difficult

2064
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:29,100
But if the computer can understand this direction, then the necessity of this master's existence will also be reduced

2065
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:32,900
So in the end machines will replace people faster and faster

2066
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:36,300
Below what we just talked about, he ran up from that button

2067
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:41,000
What we are seeing now is the manufacturing industry, they are talking about one case at a time

2068
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:48,700
The implementation started last year, and many factories immediately bought more than 1,000 robots

2069
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,400
Because the degree of automation in the manufacturing industry is already very high

2070
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,200
Now it's the same in the office

2071
01:34:55,200 --> 01:35:00,200
If our secretary asks for too much leave every day, he will take this

2072
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,160
This secretary machine has been introduced

2073
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:06,440
Ingredient designer if moody day and night

2074
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,140
Low-level composition design is completely done by computer

2075
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,740
24 hours is scary

2076
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,180
and he's very fast

2077
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,040
simple assistant

2078
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:17,080
This is a teacher I just talked about

2079
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,820
Also watch out

2080
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:22,680
Because there are so many good teaching materials on the Internet

2081
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:25,180
are taught by very famous teachers.

2082
01:35:25,180 --> 01:35:28,280
The only inconvenience is when you say you don't understand

2083
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,280
he won't tell you

2084
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,680
If he had a teacher today with a question answering system next to

2085
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:34,080
a teaching assistant

2086
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:36,280
You don't understand, stop him and ask the teaching assistant

2087
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:38,980
what did that sentence mean

2088
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,120
words he understands

2089
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:45,320
Does this person still need to go to school?

2090
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,840
The best teacher in the world has been recorded

2091
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,720
The best teaching assistants are by your side to help you answer questions

2092
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,820
In this case

2093
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:53,720
many teachers work

2094
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,580
Like teaching elementary school books, if you have to talk about it, you don’t have to teach it.

2095
01:35:56,580 --> 01:36:00,020
because you can only teach one hour a day

2096
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,600
That computer is available 24 hours a day

2097
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,300
no way to compare with him

2098
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,600
so it's very dangerous

2099
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,100
assistant too

2100
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:08,400
I'm talking about research assistants

2101
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,300
A lot of things for research assistants are highly repetitive

2102
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,500
the more this kind of thing

2103
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,200
you have to be more careful

2104
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:16,400
I can write a sincere story later

2105
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,800
Please write a sincere story and replace yourself

2106
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,300
This is actually happening

2107
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:24,500
no one did it on purpose

2108
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:25,400
that is

2109
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,400
Because what he does is too monotonous

2110
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:28,600
He doesn't like doing it either, right?

2111
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,900
Then he will write a truth instead

2112
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:33,500
So slowly these jobs will be replaced by machines

2113
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:36,400
That's all for today's speech

2114
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,000
thank you

2115
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:46,000
Thank you, Director Xu, for your wonderful speech.

2116
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,100
so we probably still have some time to come

2117
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,100
Let everyone be open to ask questions

2118
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:53,800
good here

2119
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,800
Press the front microphone

2120
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:58,100
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2121
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,000
I am interested and want to ask more

2122
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It lies in the Principle-based approach mentioned by the teacher just now

2123
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
But like, for example, I just gave a few examples

2124
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
It seems to be a bunch of similar things

2125
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Actively seek out a Principle

2126
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
and make things faster and better

2127
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
But I remember the Mathematics Institute of Academia Sinica

2128
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
The Journal of Mathematical Communication has been talking about one thing for a while now

2129
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
That is to say, the Western period

2130
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
It seems to be able to notice that there is a similarity with arithmetic

2131
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
It's the spirit of learning mathematics

2132
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
People who go up and down are better

2133
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
The more he seems to be able to raise his point of view

2134
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
So the teacher's Principle-based approach

2135
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
When the computer formulates these Principles

2136
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Is there any way for him to raise or lower his level

2137
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,000
In other words, is there a way for him to say

2138
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
From only being able to see whether the reference is right or wrong

2139
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
into a paper

2140
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Does he lack Principle

2141
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Or is there a way for him to

2142
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
I know a person makes a typo in a sentence

2143
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,600
Become a person who knows that he will not look at the four lines and say the wrong thing

2144
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,240
So your Principals are all parallel?

2145
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,500
Or can he see the Principals of different classes from top to bottom?

2146
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:14,780
This question is very knowledgeable

2147
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:16,940
It's just that some people may not hear clearly

2148
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:20,540
That is to say, when you study, you acquire the superficial knowledge.

2149
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:23,040
Or you can learn more abstract

2150
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,940
In fact, computers need to learn abstract knowledge

2151
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:25,340
not difficult

2152
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:27,200
because of U.S

2153
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,100
especially since we've done a lot of this kind of speech analysis

2154
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,500
So every word has its upper position

2155
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:33,500
more superior

2156
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,900
like that

2157
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:35,700
Banana right?

2158
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,800
it is a fruit

2159
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,700
Another what to eat

2160
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:39,900
then we are all done

2161
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:40,600
so

2162
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,800
Today I learned a Pattern

2163
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,500
I can ginarize it to a higher level immediately

2164
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,900
not its original word

2165
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:47,500
that this

2166
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,200
In this relatively high Pattern

2167
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:51,000
fits a lot

2168
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,900
At this time, it is equivalent to saying

2169
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,700
I can use it elsewhere

2170
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:55,400
so next time you put this

2171
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:58,300
There will be no problem changing orange apple

2172
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:00,000
This is absolutely no problem

2173
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Thanks

2174
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,480
ok there's someone over there

2175
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,480
Want to know more about that

2176
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:12,980
PBA seems to be able to understand some semantics

2177
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:15,340
green

2178
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:18,340
That is, PBA seems to understand some semantics

2179
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:20,840
Is it possible that it produces

2180
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,840
that is to say the writing part

2181
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:25,040
Use the PBA way to generate some of that

2182
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:26,040
that's easy because

2183
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,040
you think it's the other way around

2184
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:30,040
I just didn't give an example to say

2185
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,040
How would you describe the distance between two points

2186
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,040
Is the distance between the two places correct?

2187
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,040
Then you collect such tools

2188
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,040
next time i ask you to talk

2189
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:39,040
you take one of you

2190
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:41,040
Pick it out and talk it out and it's over

2191
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:46,040
So its absorption and production are the same thing

2192
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,040
the same thing

2193
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,040
Then its sentence pattern means

2194
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,040
I change it here

2195
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:51,040
what is this noun

2196
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,040
What is that noun replaced with?

2197
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,040
it can have another meaning

2198
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,040
this too

2199
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:59,040
You can go backwards from the process of learning it

2200
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
still have a question

2201
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
that joke

2202
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
That's the one

2203
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
like in Chinese

2204
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Just use the PBI method

2205
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Approximately how many Principals are there?

2206
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Can let the machine understand Chinese

2207
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
what about other languages

2208
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
this really needs to be understood

2209
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Because there are so many Principals

2210
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
speak like we do

2211
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
when we were checking restaurants

2212
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
will anyone speak

2213
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I have a friend

2214
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
like to drink

2215
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
which restaurant is suitable

2216
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
he talked for a long time

2217
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
just looking for a place to drink

2218
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
If you need to understand this sentence

2219
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
how many different ways

2220
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Can be mapped to

2221
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
can like to drink

2222
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
this is

2223
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Benefits of Big Data

2224
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I can be online today

2225
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
collect a lot of sentences like these

2226
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
i know i like to drink

2227
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
How many different ways are there

2228
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I can filter it out

2229
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
i am this one

2230
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Map

2231
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
You can't do that with Dibnurin

2232
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Because the expression of so-called meaning is human assign

2233
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
There is no saving energy on this aspect.

2234
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
But you only need to collect this information

2235
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Our principle can be learned immediately

2236
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I don't know if this answers your question

2237
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I can explain it with PPA

2238
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
The complexity is similar across languages

2239
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Its PPA has nothing to do with the language

2240
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
is your grammar or something

2241
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Your pattern itself already contains

2242
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
so it doesn't matter how your grammar is

2243
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
It can even learn your grammar

2244
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:44,000
For example, English verb singular plus S something

2245
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It can learn those things by itself

2246
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
So it has the benefit of that law

2247
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
It also has statistical calculation capabilities for this type of insertion deletion

2248
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
ok, the gentleman in the back

2249
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Teacher Qiu

2250
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Just now you mentioned that

2251
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
People are talking about many conditions in the province

2252
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
right

2253
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
people in different situations

2254
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
He can understand what you mean by planning

2255
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
But in the opposite direction, you can tell the machine to write a novel

2256
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
he is equivalent to

2257
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
because people have imagination

2258
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Then he can also imagine many conditions

2259
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
like when the teacher mentioned

2260
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Taipei Taichung

2261
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
In front he is selling tickets

2262
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
you want to buy a ticket

2263
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
But just write Taipei Taichung

2264
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
This machine can imagine

2265
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
what's in taipei

2266
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
what's in taichung

2267
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Immediately afterwards he wrote a novel

2268
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
He went to Taipei to Taichung to play

2269
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
meet someone

2270
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
who are you in love with

2271
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
a lot of them all come out

2272
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Is it possible to write a novel

2273
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
He inversely creates situations for himself

2274
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
we talked about this

2275
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
that is

2276
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
You just have to teach him something

2277
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
he can have a similar effect

2278
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
this is possible

2279
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
if you give him a lot of this novel

2280
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
he will read love novels

2281
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,000
different from the other one, what happened first and what happened later

2282
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
After he remembers these things

2283
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
He has another Principle Base to remember these

2284
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Then things with similarities and minor differences will be regenerated by him.

2285
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
For example, when we write a letter of introduction

2286
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
We usually say that the student is very hardworking

2287
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
But he's not the smartest, we don't speak negatively

2288
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
we will turn around, right?

2289
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,000
From work to business, I talked for a long time

2290
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
You can tell that he's not that smart

2291
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
In this sentence, this sequence can be handed over to the computer

2292
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
you mark a lot of paragraphs like this

2293
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Tell him that's a description that says he's hardworking, but not the smartest

2294
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,000
5 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent than what we marked

2295
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
He'll learn how to talk about five percent in the future

2296
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
How do you say twenty percent ten percent

2297
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
so this is possible

2298
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,000
But the front needs people to meet this standard

2299
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
if he has the ability

2300
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:02,660
right

2301
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:05,000
assume an architect

2302
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Others have a piece of land

2303
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,160
the style he wants to cover

2304
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,160
almost a thousand kinds

2305
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,760
that in this case

2306
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:14,160
Can the machine also

2307
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,500
lots of imagination

2308
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,500
I use this pattern to give him

2309
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:18,260
build this

2310
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:19,300
what flavor is he

2311
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:20,800
what personality does he fit

2312
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,000
he almost

2313
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,840
let the architect to some extent

2314
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,500
He said you design 100

2315
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,260
Then when he picked the third

2316
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,960
actually i think

2317
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,220
you are right

2318
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:32,060
today we

2319
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:33,020
machine can't do

2320
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,720
It's because we humans don't know how to teach him

2321
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,920
because we're kind of like

2322
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,320
Teach a cram student

2323
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,560
only one inside

2324
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:40,560
is the computer

2325
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,620
if i could teach

2326
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:42,720
his ability to abstract

2327
01:44:42,720 --> 01:44:44,620
will be very strong

2328
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:45,420
so because

2329
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,720
i won't abstract the way

2330
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:47,620
to teach this student

2331
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:49,960
So he has no way to generalize

2332
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:50,820
if i will

2333
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:51,620
Actually this

2334
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:53,020
you want him to generalize

2335
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:53,860
like i think say

2336
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:55,120
popular songs now

2337
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:56,520
listen carefully

2338
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:58,460
his kind though

2339
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,260
not exactly the same

2340
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:00,460
but very heavy

2341
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
There are several inflections

2342
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
If the computer memorizes this pattern

2343
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
it will write a similar

2344
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
especially when we talk about

2345
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Said that there are many dance songs in Korea that are well written

2346
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Then I learn a bit and I can make one myself

2347
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And it's guaranteed to be different

2348
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
no way to sue me

2349
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
So things like this are possible in the future

2350
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
just say now

2351
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
the hard part is saying

2352
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
We haven't caught that expression yet.

2353
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
if caught

2354
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
It will be much easier than image recognition

2355
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
ok over there thanks

2356
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
very good speech

2357
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I bought a book about this two years ago

2358
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
called "how to speed"

2359
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
not line by line

2360
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
speed

2361
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
speed

2362
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I read half of the book and still don't understand

2363
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Later I understood that you are looking for the pattern

2364
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
right

2365
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
right? just say

2366
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It gives you a square and you go find the pattern

2367
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
That's because you already have some

2368
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
So you know what it means when you see those words

2369
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,000
This is a bit like what you just said

2370
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Your reference is to use one dimensional

2371
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
is a series

2372
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Now it's impossible to read this like you said

2373
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
business book like

2374
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Also go to find the pattern in this text

2375
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:26,000
So it's like saying look at everyone

2376
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:30,000
This Chinese has a former dean named Sony Chen

2377
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,000
It doesn't matter if he goes to bed at 3 o'clock all day and half sleeps

2378
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
but he asks questions

2379
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I think he also found a pattern

2380
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
is he knows him

2381
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Halfway through your talk, he already knows about other things.

2382
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
So he has already decided the question

2383
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
So in general, this is the pattern

2384
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Will not become two dimensional

2385
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,000
To become something else is for him to sporadically find out some

2386
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
law

2387
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,840
Is this right with Xiaoxiang?

2388
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,160
In fact, part of

2389
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,760
This is actually

2390
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,200
With the basic ability of the computer

2391
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:13,200
to make this change

2392
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,920
it's very easy to tell him

2393
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:18,240
The difference now is that the understanding of basic things is not enough

2394
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:22,000
So I'm assuming he's improving so fast

2395
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,960
He will improve by leaps and bounds after reaching a level

2396
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,400
so you said

2397
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,800
write a story what?

2398
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,120
are very likely

2399
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,440
And there will be quite a bit of exclusivity

2400
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,320
Tasteful experience

2401
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:32,960
that is

2402
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:34,000
not casually

2403
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:36,800
good over there

2404
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,800
To tell you the truth, I'm also an information

2405
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:42,320
But learn for you on the screen

2406
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:42,960
No no

2407
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:44,320
I feel like

2408
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,000
Because of the problem just mentioned

2409
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,360
is his relevance

2410
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,320
Then we put it from the original system

2411
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,400
You do regular system analysis first

2412
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,600
analysis becomes structure

2413
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,000
The structure will later become Majiu and become a block

2414
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:56,400
right

2415
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,600
slowly become

2416
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,120
he will become a parameter

2417
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:00,000
On the top

2418
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,640
A parameter structure has

2419
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:05,640
Now the other sea and air joint defense is our anti-fat gallbladder

2420
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:08,840
That is the whole from the satellite to the bottom

2421
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:10,000
is also an enterprise architecture

2422
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,440
Enterprise Architecture

2423
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,640
It is also doing the whole structure integration

2424
01:48:13,640 --> 01:48:15,240
That architecture has reasoning

2425
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,040
Now I'm doing something with some friends

2426
01:48:18,040 --> 01:48:18,740
that is

2427
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:23,240
In this way, some parts may need to be consulted with you

2428
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,740
can help

2429
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:26,040
at this

2430
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:28,340
We can wait for this and we are off the market

2431
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,840
It's okay, I just said something

2432
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:31,440
It's on the Buddhist scriptures

2433
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,740
It's just too complicated, repetitive scenes and characters appear

2434
01:48:34,740 --> 01:48:37,940
In fact, several parameters are extracted from it.

2435
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:38,940
over here

2436
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:40,140
structure we already have

2437
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:42,240
Then these screened parts

2438
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,480
and for example

2439
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:45,200
More than 100 Buddhist medium personalities

2440
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,340
Then each individual element

2441
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:47,880
I'll ask you later

2442
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,200
can you use this to help

2443
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,900
So this is how to refine Buddhist scriptures into

2444
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,940
For example, it is a copy of Uncle Si

2445
01:48:54,940 --> 01:48:55,780
a bible ist

2446
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:57,140
can refine him

2447
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:58,340
Ben has been good for so many years

2448
01:48:58,340 --> 01:48:59,480
everyone speak one

2449
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,560
You explain me and I don't understand until now

2450
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,600
In fact, it is found that the structure is quite clear

2451
01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:05,640
that time here

2452
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,920
it's absolutely possible

2453
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:07,940
right now we

2454
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:11,520
One of the things they did to help the food and clothing store was to put

2455
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:12,800
Earlier

2456
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,360
What is that twenty forty?

2457
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,680
All these people, officials and civilians inside, what?

2458
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,220
find all the horizon

2459
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,020
and then with the current location

2460
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:24,320
GPS corresponds to it

2461
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,120
There is one of these things

2462
01:49:26,120 --> 01:49:27,140
pretty solid result

2463
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:28,680
So it means

2464
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:30,220
as long as you will take him

2465
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:33,800
After you tell him some important notes

2466
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,820
have enough of

2467
01:49:34,820 --> 01:49:36,620
data he can learn

2468
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:39,940
After learning it, he can make this mark instead of you

2469
01:49:39,940 --> 01:49:44,300
In this way, your understanding of the article will be more and more marked

2470
01:49:44,300 --> 01:49:46,340
for you to understand

2471
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:48,140
that paragraph of the article

2472
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:50,940
This story is easier to present

2473
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:51,460
so

2474
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:53,000
just said

2475
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,300
There is his little story in one sentence

2476
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,100
sentence like a small sentence paragraph

2477
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:00,120
There is more in a paragraph

2478
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
But it's actually the way it starts and turns

2479
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
can be learned

2480
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
the same book

2481
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Here's a gentleman after

2482
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
we probably don't have much time

2483
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Good idea, the question I want to ask is relatively basic

2484
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
implementation part

2485
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Just now you mentioned that you need to mark

2486
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
that's there

2487
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
The current mainstream trust understanding

2488
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
in you

2489
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
it may be used

2490
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Word to vet is to quantify these words

2491
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Including these principles

2492
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Possibly also with phasors

2493
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Then use some probability parameters

2494
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
is it here

2495
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
This imbedding or this

2496
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Is there a label

2497
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
use this method

2498
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
this thing is very useful

2499
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
but it is important to understand

2500
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
It actually does that kind of cluster

2501
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
its comprehension comparison to those who understand

2502
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Not helpful, but he does a lot of tools that are very useful

2503
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
We now hope to have a new world full factor

2504
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
understandable

2505
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
It is also a vector, a vector that people can understand

2506
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Then he has the same effect

2507
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,000
In this way, it can replace a vector that is now purely quantitative

2508
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Then when he learns, his skills will be stronger

2509
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Then he marked it manually, Nano or machine learning

2510
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
is the algorithm

2511
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
It's half manual and half learned.

2512
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
All have to be learned automatically, it is impossible to rely on people

2513
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Excuse me

2514
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
just heard you say that

2515
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
That is to say, let the so-called computer deal with the dead.

2516
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
is getting easier

2517
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,000
The problem is that if you turn the living into the dead

2518
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
According to your rigid method there should be a

2519
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
A very basic database

2520
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
For example, the correspondence of words

2521
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
There are so-called Chinese characters in the oriental characters

2522
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
There are new Chinese characters

2523
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
even privately printed Chinese characters

2524
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
If you say these

2525
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
In the latest privately printed Chinese characters

2526
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:27,000
So if it is in the information system of the China Theater Academy

2527
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
because of the word

2528
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
This so-called privately printed Chinese character is illiterate

2529
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Then all the expressions using privately printed Chinese characters

2530
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
the living

2531
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
can never be

2532
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
so-called information system

2533
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
replace the dead aspect of the living

2534
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Is it this way

2535
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Now this is a

2536
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
no shit problem

2537
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:54,000
That means we can do one thing today

2538
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Because its influence is greater than one degree

2539
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Whether in academia or industry, we will be able to

2540
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
get enough money to do

2541
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
so now say

2542
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
any question

2543
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Is it really that influential?

2544
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
this is more important

2545
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
instead of saying this question

2546
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
does it make sense to some people

2547
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
In fact, when we studied

2548
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
In fact, we have many directions

2549
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,000
So we ended up looking for a more capable

2550
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
There are funds and someone is willing to do it

2551
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
like a lot of things you have money for

2552
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
like can't find anyone to do

2553
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Basically not easy to succeed

2554
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
So this is a difficult place

2555
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
i think i'll ask

2556
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
last question

2557
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Because of something you just said

2558
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
There is something to learn first

2559
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
because there is some learning

2560
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
merge it first

2561
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,000
so where it starts

2562
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
is a very well defined

2563
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:49,000
a path

2564
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,000
because you already told him

2565
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I'm going this way

2566
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
we are many

2567
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I think human speaking

2568
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
There is a great

2569
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
very special one

2570
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
A key point is that people have the ability to create

2571
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:09,560
That is to say, many of us are in the middle of the development of our science

2572
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:10,840
There are some paradigms

2573
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,600
is that it is a jump

2574
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,160
something new comes out

2575
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:15,960
and then create a new field

2576
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,400
so in this regard

2577
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:21,200
It is the kind of creative we have now

2578
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:23,640
Among the students, we often want to find

2579
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:24,640
something

2580
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,400
Now everyone is talking behind their backs

2581
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,360
This thing can be learned

2582
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,680
or are you born

2583
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,120
or what about your brain

2584
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,440
so in this regard

2585
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:34,840
Is it in the AI

2586
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:40,440
Is there any research going on in this direction

2587
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,920
This is now because its level is too high

2588
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,640
That is to say, even if someone has researched

2589
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:45,600
I don't care about writing paper

2590
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,440
because this is written

2591
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,520
debateable

2592
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,880
That is, many people will argue

2593
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,120
disagree with it

2594
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:53,560
i think there must be

2595
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:56,520
Like us I remember in the field of mathematics

2596
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,040
I see many examples

2597
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,080
What is set algebra in mathematics?

2598
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,400
He made some new discoveries , important prize - winning discoveries

2599
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:09,080
It was he who brought some concept of geometry to that algebra

2600
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,080
so he became famous

2601
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,580
abstract substitution

2602
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:15,580
We just had a gentleman ask

2603
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:19,080
Say you see one sentence and think of another

2604
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:21,580
If that correspondence

2605
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:24,580
Abstraction corresponds to the words you can rendezvous on the computer

2606
01:55:24,580 --> 01:55:26,080
he can try

2607
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,580
Some of them might succeed when he tries.

2608
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:32,160
So in fact they have someone running an experiment right now

2609
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:34,660
That is to say, he asked the computer to prove it.

2610
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:40,160
But he simply let the computer generate such abstract things at will

2611
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,660
See if he can put him in the same way

2612
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:45,660
It can be used in different places to prove some new theorems

2613
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:48,660
This theorem has never been proven

2614
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,660
This kind of experiment is being done

2615
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:53,660
So maybe what you're talking about is a bit like

2616
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:57,960
Then I would like to say that there is another question that is more related to daily life.

2617
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,040
That is to say we are now online

2618
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,700
search or something

2619
01:56:01,700 --> 01:56:04,600
or inside your outer Broadder

2620
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:07,000
There is inside the browser

2621
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,700
i have a feeling say

2622
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:11,000
i do everything now

2623
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,300
May be Google

2624
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,600
or what is collecting this information

2625
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:17,100
So it means that he is learning to say

2626
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,400
i will do something

2627
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,300
collect this information

2628
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:20,500
then analyze

2629
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,100
Then I often find

2630
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,800
how to jump out of an ad

2631
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:27,200
It seems to be aimed at

2632
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:28,500
This is a personalized ad

2633
01:56:28,500 --> 01:56:30,200
a reaction of

2634
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,300
Now this thing is really going on

2635
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:33,200
or do we know

2636
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:34,400
what the hell is he doing

2637
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,800
none of us know

2638
01:56:35,800 --> 01:56:38,400
We are practically all in every move

2639
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,400
There is a machine learning

2640
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,700
he wants to study later

2641
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,200
he wants to do something

2642
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:45,900
This is actually in progress

2643
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:46,600
this is so

2644
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,100
that is

2645
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:49,700
It is very strictly managed in Google

2646
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,900
That is to say, like our machine temple

2647
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,300
Many of the letters we wrote are in it

2648
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:55,700
So it is absolutely not allowed to see

2649
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,100
but you can use a computer

2650
01:56:57,200 --> 01:56:59,300
program to read

2651
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:00,000
gentlemen

2652
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
To analyze, people can't see

2653
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
When is this information more dangerous?

2654
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
One day the U.S. government

2655
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Trump went up and he said

2656
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
You give me all this personal information

2657
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
then you have to give

2658
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
They are now the US government can go

2659
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Ask his company for everything

2660
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Then how do you use this thing after you get it?

2661
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
then we don't know

2662
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
So he will rely on this information in the future

2663
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
there are so many things to do

2664
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
As for the person in the ad

2665
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
this is always done

2666
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
because it actually does no harm to the user

2667
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
So those of us Gmail stuff

2668
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Humans can't read but machines can

2669
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So there are so many in the world

2670
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
When he read it, he didn't say

2671
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
For you personally, but read a general pattern

2672
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
to the general pattern

2673
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
he is not reading personal

2674
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:56,000
OK, let's do it today

2675
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
It ends here

2676
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
thanks again

2677
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Xu said such a brilliant speech
