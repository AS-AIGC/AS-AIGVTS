The theme of this video is the impact of plant cell structure and gene mutation on plant reproduction and growth. The speaker, Dr. Zhao Guangyu, used Arabidopsis thaliana as a research model to introduce the principles of T-DNA insertion and other mutant strains, and discussed how to use plant materials to study genes that affect growth. It is mentioned in the film that the study of mutants can help to find the key genes involved in the flowering process of plants. Then it explained the key steps of plant cell interaction, pollen tube growth and double fertilization in the process of pollination, and mentioned the parts that still need to be further studied. Using special techniques (such as laser manipulation, confocal optical microscopy, etc.) to study the process of plant breeding, and finally share the T-DNA gene transfer technology and its application in plant gene research. This video introduces techniques such as splicing mechanism, gene introduction into plant cells by Agrobacterium, gene editing and EMS mutation to observe the stability of fluorescent protein in the genome. The speaker, Dr. Gao Guangyu, shared her study experience and research experience, emphasizing the importance of studying hard and developing good habits. He discussed issues such as the source of Iron Cannon Lily, the change of plant flowering time, etc., and advocated respecting nature in research and finding uses and values ​​from it. At the same time, he also mentioned the research on the standards and aesthetic concepts of women's beauty in Ming and Qing Dynasties. ,
