22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,640
We invite you to the Institute of Molecular Biology of our hospital tonight

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,400
The special evaluation researcher of the inspection team came to tell us

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Then we also have an online live broadcast

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Teacher Na Jian graduated from the Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,800
Then went to the State University of New York to study for a Ph.D.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,400
when he was a doctor

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
developed a very important experimental method

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,800
The two-hybrid approach we call Filial Mother Army

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,800
This is used to test the binding between protein and protein

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Because this method was later widely used

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,800
It is a very important research tool in biology

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,800
His teacher was elected a member of the American Academy of Sciences for this

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
This is what he did when he was a doctor

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:02:00,800
After his postdoctorate, he went to the Faculty of the University of California

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Returned to the Institute of Molecular Biology of our school in 1996

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
right in my lab we're next door

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Teacher Jianâ€™s research in recent years has not only done

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
research institutes also research institutes

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Returned to the Institute of Molecular Biology of our school in 1996

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
right in my lab we're next door

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Check teacher's research in recent years

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In recent years, in addition to doing basic nervous system development

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
also started to work on neurodegenerative diseases

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
some related research

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
it has won many awards

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Including our Academy's Young Scholar Book Award

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Excellence Award from the Ministry of Science and Technology

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Academic Awards of the Ministry of Education Hou Jindui Research Award

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Taiwan's Science and Technology Award

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He also does a lot of service work

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Including serving as the chairman of this basic neurological society in Taiwan

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then he will tell us a very interesting topic today

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
walking with neurologists

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then he's going to talk about fate, fairness and competition.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
From the aspects of learning, degeneration and medical treatment of the nervous system

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then we welcome Teacher Shoulder

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay, thank you grandson Mi for the introduction.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Then I came back to Taiwan for about 22 years

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's very trustworthy and Sun Zimi is the laboratory next door

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's always been the lab next door

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So besides his family, the person he sees the most should be me

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I am very happy that I can give a speech here today

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then this is a challenge for us

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because it is a popular science speech

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Then I'll try to put my research over the years

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
compare with what i think

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
My normal language to speak to you

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but if it's too simple

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please forgive me too

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Help me stop if it's too hard

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
feel free to ask no problem

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What I tell you today is

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
In fact, neurons

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
neurons

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This topic was first ordered by my students

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because they said that there was a Korean movie called

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
"Rain God" is very popular

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Me and some Korean drama students come to listen to this

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
so i ordered one

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Title of "Rain Neuron Pass"

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
In fact we want to say

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
look at nerve cells or neurons

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Its whole development and whole heredity

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
how to decide its itinerary

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
as if i'm next to you

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
look at a nerve cell

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
From birth to differentiation to aging

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
process to death

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
what the hell is a change

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
between cells

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And what is the relationship between cells and genes?

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Interactions or what a regulation looks like

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Then I returned to Taiwan 22 years ago

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Then go to the branch office

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then the first thing is to get married and have children

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And here are my two kids

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That photo from 20 years ago

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Then the model organisms in our laboratory

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
is made with fruit flies

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Every model organism looking at the organisms of Drosophila

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Of course, watch your child grow up

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is actually a model organism

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
is a model organism for a person

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
then i feel very curious

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You will find that these two children

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
why does it look so similar

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Of course, this is very simple.

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Both parents have the same genes

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The other point is that

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Except very...

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
so we know that

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the process by which genes contribute to the formation of an organism

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
In fact, it has a big, big impact like this

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But the two are not exactly the same, right?

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Because their genes can't be exactly the same

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There is a part of father and part of mother.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So this is what caused me to be interested in this gene

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This one with the research topic of development...

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
At the same time, we also use nerve cells

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It is neurons that are the subject of this study

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
so before starting

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll tell you first

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
easy

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think many people may also know

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But still take a little time

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
with everyone

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
ditch this

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
tell everyone about this

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The definition of a few simple nouns of neurons

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Then the definition of this noun you heard

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You may be very clear to many people

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
but if you haven't heard

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
you can follow me

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's memorize these words for a while

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
it's easier to wait

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can memorize the process as I told you.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Then the nerve cells seen here

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
everyone can see

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh, the nerve cells

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In fact, a nerve cell

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
a cell

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
its own function

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's not really obvious

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
the nerve cells

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
one after the other

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
one after another

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then such a nerve will form a

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So-called

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
to connect together

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
forming one

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
network time

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
it only has one

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
a function is here

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So the nerve cells

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
to be connected together

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
basically i

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,020
We can divide it into three parts from its type

159
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
You can see that this neuron

160
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,520
The most important thing is a neural ontology

161
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,780
an ontology

162
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,280
just like its body itself

163
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,480
This provides the entire nerve cell with very high

164
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,480
may be some protein

165
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,600
RNA or some kind of nutrient

166
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,320
or something

167
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,640
so that the nerve can have a normal function like this

168
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,640
So there is a cell's body

169
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,440
In addition, there is a long plant called axon, which is very long

170
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,480
The nerve cell itself has a very long one

171
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
we can see say

172
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,980
Almost every nerve cell has an axon like this

173
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,980
The axon is actually what everyone remembers that the axon is a

174
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,980
send a signal in one direction

175
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,980
That is to say, the nerve cell body

176
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,480
it sends the signal out

177
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
sent out from the axon like this

178
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
sent to the next nerve cell

179
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,480
What part does the nerve cell receive

180
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
it's called speed

181
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
just stand out

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
it's the other end

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
mostly the other end

184
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It has some quite forked

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There are quite a lot of forks. This is called Sutu.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then this old rabbit is receiving the signal

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So everyone remembers that there is an ontology

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There's an axis rabbit, there's an old rabbit like this

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then the neuron can

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
one after another

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So we see here that

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Here are two nerve cells

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Then this is its body, the axis rabbit

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If the axis rabbit, the tail will be forked

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's the rabbit with another cell

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
it can be connected together

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
form a ratio of possibly several connections

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The place where this connection is called Tutu

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because there is a place where the axis rabbit and the old rabbit come into contact

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's called Tutu

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's where the two pictures came out

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The place of contact is called Tutu

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that's where they communicate

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This axis rabbit handles the signal

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a telegram

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And then to this point of contact

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
some chemical molecules

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and then to the next neuron

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Receive the signal and pass it on

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So we can say

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
In our brain, there are actually many, many such nerve cells connected with nerve cells

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then pass the signal through to make a thing

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So we have a lot of new networks in our brains like this

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can say that it is a very complex network interaction effect

215
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
we can ask

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How many neurons are there in our brain

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then how much prominence

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
how many complex networks

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In fact, people often compare the planets in this universe with the nerve cells in the brain

220
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Who is more like this

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is of course I copied it from that Euclopedia

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That is to say, the star shape of the Milky Way is about 10 to the 11th power

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The star shape of the universe is about 10 to the 23rd power

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There are about 1011 grids of neurons in the brain

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
very very many

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Each person's brain is about 10 to the 11th power

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Then you are similar to the star shape of our Milky Way in the universe

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,160
Neural gardens can form about a thousand

229
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
contact with another thousand neurons

230
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,460
It's like a thousand synapses

231
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,040
So there are about 14 synapses

232
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,040
So it looks like it is much less than the stars in the universe

233
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,840
The cells of this neural garden are almost as careful as tremella

234
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
But then I thought

235
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,680
Hey, we're not alone

236
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,080
not alone in this world

237
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,760
there are so many people in our world

238
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,800
Then every person often we have some collective behaviors

239
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,360
Bubble our cultural creation

240
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,640
scientific research

241
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,520
So if we add up the synapses of humans all over the world

242
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,960
only the 24th square

243
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
So this is actually a very large number.

244
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,640
so for us to say

245
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,200
Hey, we want to study the structure of this neural garden

246
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,040
its birth its formation

247
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,560
And what's the function of its whole connection together?

248
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,280
that's a very interesting subject

249
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,280
Not only are there many nerve cells

250
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,480
In addition to so many nerve cells in our brain

251
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,160
We also have a lot of complex different

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,700
We have types of nerve cells

253
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,600
Then let's show you this again

254
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
there are many

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
show a very wide variety of nerve cells

256
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
inside our brain

257
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Then you can see that there is a very simple

258
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,500
like this one

259
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,100
We call it granule cells like this

260
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,900
This accounts for more than 50% of the brain

261
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,300
Then of course we have very complex

262
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,800
like this one in the cerebellum

263
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,400
Putin's One Cell

264
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,600
you can see say

265
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,700
its quick burst

266
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,000
Sutu The Sutu we just talked about is the signal place

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,300
In fact, the bifurcation is very powerful.

268
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,300
You can see that it keeps forking

269
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,500
It really looks like a tree

270
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,200
and the motor neurons on our spine

271
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,100
There are so many motor nerve cells in our spine

272
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,800
Then you can see that it is also

273
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
A nerve cell has many branches

274
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Then finally inside our cerebral cortex

275
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,300
There are a lot of this so-called

276
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,500
vertebral neurons

277
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,100
Then this is the same as our human beings later

278
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,300
A neuron involved in this cognitive aspect

279
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,100
There are many such

280
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,000
So we can see that in fact we

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,900
In addition to a lot of

282
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
outside of nerve cells

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,840
We also have many different types of Shenyin cells

284
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,580
Well, this is actually a big problem for us.

285
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,240
That is to say, in addition to the fact that our brains need to grow a lot of divine sound cells

286
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,380
How do we control and grow different Shenyin cells?

287
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,540
You can do different functions like this

288
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,840
throughout our development

289
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,140
Then how does this cause different Shenyin cells to come out?

290
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,440
allows us to perform different jobs like this

291
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,580
Well, this is actually very complicated because the brain is too complicated

292
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,020
Then too many different kinds of Shenyin cells

293
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,680
So my subjects are actually fruit flies.

294
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,120
Then we have to simplify the problem to say

295
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,320
Then I will ask a Shenyin cell, a certain Shenyin cell

296
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,920
How on earth did it grow and grow like this?

297
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,120
Then we use a steel wool from a fruit fly

298
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,720
It's called steel wool, which means you can see the fruit flies.

299
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,480
If you have seen fruit flies

300
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,980
There are a lot of these thin ones on its back

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,400
Then the steel wool is actually a sensory organ of the nerves.

302
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,200
under it there is a hair growing on the outside

303
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
it has a nerve cell underneath it

304
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,300
So when you touch this it's outside this hair

305
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,800
The nerve cells underneath it will have a feeling

306
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,000
This signal is then sent to the state-run central nervous system

307
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,700
That's why the state-owned company knows that someone touches it like this

308
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,000
In fact, there are a lot of people in the state camp

309
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,500
you can see a lot of roots

310
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
And it's very neatly arranged

311
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,700
Then there are some gaps in the middle like this

312
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,500
This is a state run one

313
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,400
Then when I was doing postdoctoral research at the time

314
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
while in san francisco

315
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,700
In fact, the research is such a simple question that

316
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,400
How did this steel wool come about?

317
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,200
In fact, after years of research, a researcher found that

318
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,100
In fact, the simple thing is that fate is destiny

319
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
That is to say, these steel wool

320
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,000
What kind of nerve organelles grow under it

321
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
It was doomed when it was born

322
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,700
Then we can see that

323
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,200
One advantage of using Guina for research is that

324
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
We can mutate a gene

325
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,760
So we call a gene a proneural gene

326
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,960
It is a gene related to the formation of nerve cells

327
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,360
When it can be removed, you saw that it was on the back of the fruit camp

328
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
It was supposed to grow a lot of steel wool

329
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,040
Actually gone

330
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,400
It's just a few skin cells left like this

331
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,080
just a skin cell

332
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,760
So let's talk about gene expression

333
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,640
it can form this steel wool

334
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,560
Then it can grow the nerve cells of its sensory organs

335
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Then you can let it feel these external stimuli

336
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,840
Then there are some responses like this

337
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,640
So this proneural gene

338
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,440
Actually when I come back

339
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,240
It is also the beginning of research on this subject

340
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,200
That is, how do proneural genes work?

341
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, of course there is not only one kind of fruit camp.

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,880
sensory nerve cells

343
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,480
sensory nerve cells

344
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,520
Our fruit camp is relatively simple

345
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,400
So we can in its peripheral nervous system

346
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,960
see that there are three different types of nerve cells

347
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
a type of nerve cell called the extrinsic

348
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,760
organ , we just saw that steel hair

349
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,120
it can feel the touch

350
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,120
Under the table, we just can't see under the table

351
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,080
In fact there is another sense organ

352
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,040
It's actually feeling the contraction of the muscles

353
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,320
or can make it feel balanced

354
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,880
it looks very different

355
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,320
You can see it looks very different than this one

356
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,680
Another type of neuron called a multivelocity synapse

357
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,320
It's very long and fast

358
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,120
it also has its function

359
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
they look very different

360
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,680
They also function very differently

361
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,680
But how different are they?

362
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,640
The teacher is when they decide to say

363
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
are they different

364
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,680
The question we're asking is that

365
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,240
How did this nerve cell become different?

366
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,560
that's when it decided it was different

367
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,640
This is consistent with our research findings

368
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,040
very imaginative very different

369
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,920
It turns out that very, very early in embryonic development, very early

370
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,440
At the beginning, it was an epidermal cell formed from outside

371
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
He already decided his fate

372
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,440
In other words, the proneural gene we just talked about

373
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,440
He may have been out very early when he was paired to express a proneural gene

374
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,440
He decided to become this sensory organ

375
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
But if another proneural gene is expressed

376
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,940
when it's called etonal

377
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,440
He might have influenced him to change into another form.

378
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,240
the last amus

379
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,240
He may also mean that when he expresses

380
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,240
He formed this kind of nerve cells

381
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
So it echoes what I just said at the beginning

382
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,240
Although his nerve cells look very different

383
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
very different functions

384
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
But he seems to be at the beginning of his birth

385
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
His expression of nerve genes has already determined that he becomes a nerve cell

386
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Then this is a lot like destiny

387
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
It was doomed early in the morning

388
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,240
He will be able to escape the arrangement of fate

389
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
cell fate decisions

390
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well, this state-run research is actually in this area

391
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
great contribution

392
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because these protothec

393
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
not only in the state

394
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
In fact, his evolution has a very high degree of reservation

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So a lot of it is found in mice

396
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Protothecium gene

397
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Then we know rats are more complicated than state run

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He has all sorts of peripheral germ cells

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Then they express different protothecium genes

400
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
in different places

401
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
that can decide him

402
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Where will you be in the future

403
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Grow this different germ cells out

404
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So this looks like a

405
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
very simple law

406
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that is, gene expression

407
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
and very early expression

408
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
can determine the germ cell

409
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The fate of this future is like this

410
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
this is a

411
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
pretty simple example

412
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That

413
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But

414
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
seems to be a gene expression

415
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It seems that the decision can be made immediately

416
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He's going to turn into a germ cell

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But it's actually that simple

418
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That in the study found that

419
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's not that simple

420
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Discovered that you are going to become a germ cell

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
You go through a so-called competitive process

422
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,700
That's what I said in it

423
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,400
There is also a process of competition between cells

424
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,700
Then we know that in some epidermis

425
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,600
So the surface layer of cells

426
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,700
For example, here are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

427
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,400
7 cells

428
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Then there is only one of these 7 cells

429
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,600
7 will only choose one

430
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,100
to become a nerve cell

431
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,800
Come on, that sounds full

432
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
highly competitive

433
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
It's better than the election we just ended

434
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,100
more intense feeling

435
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,900
7 only one

436
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Then who and how to choose

437
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,800
how to compete

438
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Then we often want to say that competition has two strategies

439
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
you would think right

440
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
how is one

441
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,400
self-improvement, right?

442
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,600
I make myself better

443
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,300
I beat others, right?

444
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,900
Others got 99 points, I got 100 points

445
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
i beat him

446
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,700
What's another strategy for the competition?

447
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,400
Yes, like an election

448
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Initiation marks, right?

449
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,260
make others worse

450
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,960
Then this competition is actually more practical than a bad strategy

451
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,860
We call it the test of will

452
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,960
test will

453
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,960
That is to say

454
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,560
If one of the cells wants to become that nerve cell

455
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,560
it sends out a signal

456
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,460
go to the cells next to the consciousness say

457
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,660
Don't be like me, don't be like a nerve cell

458
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,260
ok like this i mean

459
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,660
It's just that I'm a volition, you don't want

460
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,300
don't be like me

461
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,960
OK, there is a premise here, that is

462
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,300
In fact, each of these cells has the potential to become

463
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,260
The ability of nerve cells

464
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,060
i have the potential

465
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,700
can become nerve cells

466
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,360
But because of competition

467
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,800
Only one can become a nerve cell

468
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,660
Then the rest will retreat back into an epidermal cell

469
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,800
OK

470
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,500
How to do this experiment

471
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,960
Let's say this is the final conclusion

472
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,760
How about this experiment

473
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,900
Well, there is actually a very simple experiment that

474
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,720
Someone went to observe the embryo and said

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Here's a group of cells, and one of them

476
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
seems to start turning into something like a nerve cell

477
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
start to change

478
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll take a laser then

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Strong laser kills this one

480
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
what happened then?

481
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If this one is going to become a nerve cell and be killed

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What will happen to the other six?

483
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Clam?

484
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
replace, who replaces?

485
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
re-compete

486
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
you might just say

487
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
we put that

488
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It seems that the person who is going to be elected will be grinded and killed.

489
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There are six other people to compete, right?

490
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
How many people will become nerve cells?

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
still one

492
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So why is he still one?

493
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
six in six

494
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
the answer is one

495
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's simple to say

496
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Because these six, these seven cells

497
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
His ability, has the potential to become a nerve cell

498
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
He also has the potential to suppress others

499
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
So when we kill this

500
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,500
One of the others becomes a nerve cell

501
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
He also wants to restrain others

502
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I was in class at that time

503
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
when telling jokes

504
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
I often think of the former Yiqingzhuang case in Taiwan

505
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
We often arrest gangsters, don't we?

506
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
It turns out that strategy doesn't work

507
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Because how about you arrest big brother

508
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Brothers will compete, right?

509
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
Then someone became a big brother

510
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,000
So this is very troublesome

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
And what must the elder brother do?

512
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Because he wants to help other boys, right?

513
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
So here's an experiment that's actually quite interesting

514
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
That is to say, he has a will

515
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Cells compete by suppressing others

516
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Then this example is a very interesting example

517
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Then we see that lateral will

518
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:50,500
is this a fair competition

519
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
In fact, our scientists found in the research that

520
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
When this side will will produce a

521
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
on the surface of this cell through two proteins

522
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
exchange of

523
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It sends the signal that you can't be like a neuron

524
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So there is a saying that proves that this is a gene related to side shifting characters

525
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That is to say, you mutate this protein

526
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Let it mutate, make it impossible to pass the signal

527
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
At this time, it is different from the experimental results just now.

528
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
how is it

529
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Because I said each one has the potential to become a nerve cell

530
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So after you cancel the side shifting word

531
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They have no communication, no competition

532
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So each of them has become a nerve cell.

533
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
that's cool

534
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So this is a process of shifting characters sideways

535
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Everyone has to compete with each other and you can suppress others

536
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Then I now use the genetic method to remove the suppression mechanism

537
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Everyone becomes this nerve cell

538
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is there any evidence for this?

539
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then I will show you a picture and everyone will know

540
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
see this one

541
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
When we said this was normal

542
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
this one gang

543
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Next to it are actually epidermal cells

544
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
very many epidermal cells

545
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Then you saw that I removed the mechanism of this one

546
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Wow, this is one weight and one weight this

547
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Steel wool, there are divine sound cells underneath

548
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Shenyin cells

549
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So this means that we put this mechanism

550
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
to remove later

551
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
then this this this

552
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Everyone will become Shenyin cells

553
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is how everyone chooses

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
not bad

555
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That

556
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
that

557
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Then here's another interesting question.

558
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
this

559
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I often say this example in class

560
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That is to say, once the cell has a cell

561
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I just talked about this cell

562
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
it is in

563
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
During the competition just now

564
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
has been selected

565
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So in the future you will become like a Shenyin cell

566
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Then does it really become a Shenyin cell?

567
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
we later found out that

568
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Hey, this process is actually quite laborious.

569
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
it doesn't mean i'm in this

570
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Among seven or eight people, I chose

571
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I will become a divine sound cell

572
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
In fact, there is still a process in the middle

573
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
This is really going to become a Shenyin cell.

574
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
It's a very hard process, this is a hard process with thousands of mountains and rivers

575
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
What about this cell, it divides

576
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,340
become two cells, and those two cells are dividing to become two cells

577
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,840
This is dividing into two cells like this

578
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,080
In fact, these four cells will form the structure of the anal hair we just talked about.

579
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,160
So the anal hair itself is composed of four cells

580
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Then it's actually a cell that just competed for the battalion after it splits

581
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,920
become four cells, then the composition of these four cells becomes a thin and wide

582
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,360
So this one feels pretty simple and we like doing pattern research with this

583
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,360
because it's so simple, four cells

584
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
But there is a big problem here

585
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
the big problem is that

586
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,360
These four cells are different

587
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,360
There is a cell that is responsible for growing the outer hair

588
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,860
Then there is a cell, which is supporting the structure of the hair

589
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
this orange cell

590
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,860
The structure that supports it is tilted up like this

591
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,360
There's a nerve cell down there

592
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
green this is a nerve cell

593
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,320
it wants to connect

594
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,600
Its speed will connect to the muscles of the anal hairs

595
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,080
it can feel when the anal hairs move

596
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,580
it has a signal to pass on

597
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,480
Next to this nerve cell is another cell that protects it

598
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,480
so you see 1234

599
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,480
that question

600
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,840
As far as we were studying cell division

601
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,720
Maybe everyone has studied biology in high school

602
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,600
One cell becomes two cells

603
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Those two cells

604
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,800
will it be different

605
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,600
we learned to say

606
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
A cell divides to become two different cells

607
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Then what we all read in the textbooks

608
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Almost one cell becomes two cells

609
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Two cells and then four cells

610
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
The cells look exactly the same

611
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
but we know

612
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,600
What we have grown into today

613
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
When we have so many different cells in our body

614
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Cells must become different during this process

615
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
right

616
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
how to be different

617
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Then here is a very good example that says

618
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
its split in the middle

619
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
After splitting, or when splitting, you already know that you are going to be different

620
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
One cell becomes two cells, two cells are different

621
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Well, how to achieve this? I let one cell divide and the two cells become different

622
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's an interesting subject

623
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Then I will show you this, and you can take a look at the next one here

624
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In fact, this is a bit like this, and it's also a bit like this

625
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
We can think of it as a concept of property

626
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
When a parent distributes this property to two children, it can actually be divided differently

627
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So we see that when the cell is about to divide

628
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You see it's his, we say mitosis, spin down

629
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's on the left and the right, you see the left and the right, this dyed protein is red

630
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This dyed protein is green

631
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The two are not the same, assigned to different proteins

632
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So cells divide, so you see this side, right this movie

633
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
There are people in it that say, look, red and green

634
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
Green goes to one cell, red stays in another cell

635
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,160
So this cell division actually seems to be

636
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,940
I can assign different

637
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,280
Properties assign different proteins to two different purple cells

638
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,840
and if your eyes

639
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,620
With a little effort, you can also notice that

640
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,440
This cell is relatively small, this cell is relatively large, right?

641
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,500
So our distribution can be divided and uneven

642
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,800
unequal like this to split like this

643
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,820
so

644
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,380
We can imagine that just now

645
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,160
won

646
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,180
After testing is

647
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,720
came out and won that cell

648
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,540
The two cells can become different when it divides

649
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,080
Because the assigned things are different

650
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,880
Then this cell is different when it divides

651
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,700
This is not the same, which can constitute four different

652
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,780
For purple cells, four cells are enough

653
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,820
combined into one

654
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,100
sensory organs like this

655
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,920
Well, there is experimental evidence for this, for example,

656
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,720
we have some mutants

657
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,240
that this

658
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,300
just won that cell if

659
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,840
split did not take place

660
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,120
One of these proteins is missing the red green protein

661
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,600
You will find that it divides and produces two identical purple cells

662
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,200
It's not doing the so-called asymmetric cell division at this time

663
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,400
Then when the cell divides again, there will be two identical cells again.

664
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,200
So this produces four cells that are exactly the same red

665
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Then in another mutant we saw that

666
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
produced four nerve cells

667
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,700
Those horse babies outside are gone.

668
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,700
so tell us here

669
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,400
There seems to be something quite unfair here

670
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,000
That is to say, when the cells divide, the substances that everyone distributes

671
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,800
So this includes protein or RNA

672
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,300
Everyone is allocated different amounts

673
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,100
So this cell inherits something different

674
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,500
Of course, the direction of its subsequent development will be different.

675
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,000
become different cells

676
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,100
OK

677
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
No problem at all

678
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,300
Then what I tell you now is very

679
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,900
the feeling of something very unfair

680
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,900
who was born that gene

681
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,200
What protein to express inherits the expression at the beginning

682
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
proneuroelastin

683
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,900
Then go through this fierce competition

684
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
And then finally distributed unequal

685
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
And then there is only one cell at the end

686
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
win out into nerve cells

687
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,400
Then everything else becomes like this non-nerve cell

688
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
That's the fact that we're

689
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
But now it's the reverse example

690
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
That is to say, in the whole developmental process

691
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Sometimes we see cells that actually cooperate

692
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
cooperate with each other

693
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
then hand in hand then together

694
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,900
to line up and then to make this last

695
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
A developmental process looks like this

696
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And they also have some so-called altruistic behaviors

697
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
it means i would rather sacrifice myself

698
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Dedicated to this society

699
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So the other side of the example we are looking at now is that

700
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
a wonderful society

701
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
what does cell society look like

702
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Then this is from this

703
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Deputy Speech of State Operations

704
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Deputy Speech of State Operations

705
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You may have seen a lot of state-run assistant actors.

706
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
this is very neat

707
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Then this state-run deputy actor is different from our human eyes

708
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Small eyes make up 800

709
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
small eyes

710
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
very neatly arranged

711
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
very neatly arranged

712
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
then i will always be in

713
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
ask students to say

714
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
how do you use when things are neatly arranged

715
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
How to make it line up very neatly

716
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
the first one is to say

717
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Because we used to live in the dormitory of the central courtyard

718
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
often hear this

719
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
When Hu Shiguo offered small favors

720
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Some people say it's on par

721
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Then all students will

722
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
align in the image and arrange

723
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So one possibility is how

724
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Everyone is here, line up

725
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Finally a signal came, everyone said

726
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Everyone look up, everyone look up, right?

727
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
This is a way to arrange

728
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
that another

729
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Of course, some people will be more clear that is to say

730
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
like a crystalline way

731
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We know that crystallization often has a seed crystal

732
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Then there may be a first stroke from the middle

733
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
then slowly

734
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Slowly stack up one by one

735
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Then we can fold very neatly

736
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
like the process of crystallization

737
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
It can be arranged one by one

738
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Then we can imagine

739
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
there may be two ways

740
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
can make this sure eye

741
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
The recovery is very neatly arranged like this

742
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Our experiment is to say that

743
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
There may be a third way

744
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
This eye developed from this piece

745
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
After development, you see this area becomes like this

746
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
you can see say

747
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
You can imagine that this row of cells

748
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
express a very specific gene like this

749
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
we found that

750
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
can't do this

751
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
According to the research findings of many people

752
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This process is actually not the two ways we mentioned earlier.

753
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
But the third way is to say

754
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
One way you can do that is

755
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Can be arranged in a row-by-row manner

756
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Then we see this row means that

757
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The development of this eye is not actually a start

758
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Then everyone holidays way

759
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
not all together

760
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And above is row by row

761
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Then this looks like everyone went to the beach to watch the waves

762
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
float over like this

763
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
a slope like this

764
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
so it starts from here

765
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Wave by wave, wave by wave

766
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Then everyone will line up

767
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
How to arrange this? Actually

768
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The theory we put forward is that

769
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
As long as you have one row, the previous row is neat

770
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Suppose we could say something like

771
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
If everyone is in order in this row

772
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
As for the people in the next row, just follow

773
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Just wipe the gap between the two people in the front row

774
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
so you know what i mean

775
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I say what the next row will show up

776
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
The next row is arranged first, how about the second row?

777
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Just wipe the gap between the two people in front of the first row

778
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So we see that there seems to be this smell here

779
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You see that this row of cells

780
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Then the next row of cells

781
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It seems that the cells are spaced in the middle

782
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
So what we say is

783
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
As long as the first row of cells is neat

784
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Then the next row is neatly looking at the gaps of the previous row and rubbing in.

785
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Then it can be neatly followed, right?

786
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Row after row can be very neat like this

787
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
So it's a simple idea

788
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,500
There is a problem here, how to form the first row

789
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,000
How do you have the neatness in the first row

790
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
In fact, we can see this

791
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,500
This is what I imagined

792
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,000
No, not necessarily experimentally verified

793
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You just said it looked like this

794
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Then you only need one in the first row

795
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Then one of course is very neat with itself

796
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
For the second row, there are two, right?

797
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's far behind him, there are only three in the third row

798
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Then get away from those two

799
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
In addition to saying, we can imagine saying

800
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
As long as one row is neat, the next row will be uneven

801
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
just follow neatly

802
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,500
Like a wave of cell division

803
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,000
that goes all the way from the back to the front

804
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,500
Then it can be worth this at the beginning

805
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Roughly arranged in the way

806
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,000
Then everyone can have a neat one

807
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Arranged like this

808
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
OK

809
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
this is

810
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Of course, this has not been confirmed in many places.

811
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,500
But this is an interesting idea like this

812
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,500
There are still some in this process

813
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,000
movement of cell populations

814
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I find this very interesting

815
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
If you watch this sub-act

816
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
This is the sub-actor and this is sliced

817
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
You slice him sideways like this

818
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
sliced â€‹â€‹like this

819
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,200
inside the slice if you look at it with one of the eyes

820
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
you see it becomes like this

821
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
This is the photoreceptor cell

822
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,600
it has a

823
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,100
An arrangement of P-type

824
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,500
P type arrangement

825
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
you all look carefully

826
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
when you look at this one

827
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Do you feel that other places are different

828
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
yes someone saw it

829
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,000
up and down are mirror images

830
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So the T-shape above looks like this

831
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
The following T shape looks like this

832
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,000
The sharper places are this one facing down and this one facing up

833
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
How did this come about?

834
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,500
Because we just said that its differentiation process is from behind

835
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
keep going forward row by row

836
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,500
Then there seems to be a line somewhere in the middle

837
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,040
separate it

838
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,540
up and down this

839
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,940
This group of cells will do different exercises

840
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,540
Therefore, in the research here, many people have found that

841
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,980
In fact, there is actually a group of cells together

842
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,720
a process of rotation

843
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,220
We see that the above cells are rotating clockwise

844
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,340
The cells below are rotating counterclockwise

845
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,360
So we can form up and down this

846
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,500
There is an arrangement of mirror images like this

847
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,300
So the formation of this ghost silver eye it neatly lined up

848
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,420
In fact, this process is quite a lot

849
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,780
Now let's talk about the third process

850
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,180
The fourth process is actually

851
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,180
Quite a special process of standing and collapsing

852
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,780
that is

853
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,180
Finally, to form a very neat monocular

854
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,580
Each single eye should be very neat and fixed.

855
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,580
In the end, a very good structure can be formed

856
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,580
But in the process of development

857
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Often a strategy is to say

858
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
Your whole eye has 800 small eyes

859
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
If each small-eyed character has 20 cells

860
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
how many cells do you need

861
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
800 times 20

862
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
right

863
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This is 16000 cells

864
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That's how many times it takes for a cell to divide

865
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
will reach 16,000 cells

866
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Then cell division can be controlled so precisely

867
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Generated exactly 16,000 cells

868
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
actually not

869
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So the development strategy is often

870
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
We often see a developmental strategy that says

871
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
We'd rather do more first

872
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Let's make 20,000 cells

873
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
18000 cells are good

874
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
we would rather have more

875
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
but not less

876
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
that's a little more

877
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
but more is good

878
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
but there will be problems

879
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
For example, we see

880
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
during development

881
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
24 hours

882
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The arrangement is not neat

883
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Especially the outermost circle

884
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
There seem to be many more cells

885
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and then 24 hours later

886
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
neatly arranged

887
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In fact, there is a cell in the middle

888
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The process of the wither

889
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
That is to say, it is ugly

890
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
If there are too many cells, they will die.

891
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
just die

892
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So in fact some cells in the middle

893
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
a signal appears

894
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,240
There is a signal in the middle

895
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,440
Then put the next cell

896
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,940
let it do this withering

897
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,440
So this cell

898
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,280
Just the right number will be left

899
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,840
Then form a grid of gold grids like this

900
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,640
Then we can see that

901
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,940
If the withering network of the cell is

902
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,780
when it didn't happen

903
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,880
In fact, the eyes began to appear some

904
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,240
The messy phenomenon is like this

905
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,640
or hypercellularity

906
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,780
or irregular arrangement

907
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,940
So this we can say

908
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,380
It's an act of setting it up

909
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,580
some cells during development

910
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,980
when its function has ended

911
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,780
or when it is not needed

912
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,080
Or just after the temporary function ends

913
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,380
then it is possible to carry out the withering of cells

914
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,480
Then just for the sake of this perfect state of the whole society

915
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,180
OK

916
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,480
So this is the second part of what I'm going to say

917
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,580
In addition to the competitive behavior we talked about at the beginning, cells

918
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,780
The second part is that cells also cooperate

919
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,180
make it act

920
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,880
Then I will now enter the third topic

921
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,080
This is quite an interesting story

922
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
i often like to say this

923
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,580
I would like to put my research under an interesting topic

924
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,280
So this tells the story first

925
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,480
it's an interesting story

926
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,600
Maybe some of you have also heard this story on the Internet

927
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,540
can also be seen

928
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,240
Or I wrote about it in House Weekly

929
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,240
that is

930
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,340
Here is a study in London, UK

931
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,640
Many people may have traveled to London

932
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,740
know that london is a very old city

933
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,540
There's a big problem with this ancient city

934
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:36,140
That is to say, its roads have been messed up for hundreds of years

935
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,140
We saw it said in an area next to a train station

936
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,440
you see this area

937
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,640
see this yellow is the big road

938
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,640
It doesn't love the way of mental peace like our lieutenant colonel

939
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,740
very straight like this

940
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,340
it's messed up like this

941
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,540
Then you should not ignore that there are many small roads inside.

942
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,040
very very complicated

943
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
then we know this

944
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Immigrants in the UK are probably different from us

945
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,300
We like to use Zhongxiao East Road Section 1 Section 2 Section 3 Section 4 Section 5

946
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,700
It's easy to remember, right?

947
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,800
Each of their roads may be called a name for a small section

948
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
A short paragraph is called a name

949
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,000
So there is a big problem here, that is,

950
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,600
What to do with inheritance car drivers in London

951
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,800
There may be tens of thousands of paths

952
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,300
Then there may be thousands of attractions

953
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
Then inherit the car driver

954
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,500
Let me tell you which road I want to go to, a certain scenic spot

955
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,700
it's about to know

956
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,200
This study was before GPS

957
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,300
so let's talk

958
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,300
Now that the GPS comes out, of course this problem will be gone.

959
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,500
So we know that some people are very good at recording

960
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,300
you just talk to him

961
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,400
He knew right away how to get there

962
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,800
That is to say, we know that he is old

963
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,500
The so-called Name-A-Gation means

964
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,600
The concept of controlling space in space is very good

965
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,900
He knew right away how to get there

966
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,800
Which road is the fastest way to go recently?

967
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,500
London heritage car drivers have a very special

968
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,100
it is more black

969
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,940
black cab driver black cab driver

970
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,140
They need special training

971
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,600
They can't just say they want to be taxi drivers

972
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
be a taxi driver

973
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,100
Because this road is too complicated

974
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,300
So their training is actually

975
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,100
like we go to college

976
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,800
they say average training down

977
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,600
to get this driver's license

978
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,100
about two to four years

979
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,300
two to four years

980
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,700
So it's not easy

981
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,500
Then you have to go through a lot of exams in the middle

982
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,100
The small test and the big test look like this

983
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,800
In fact, many people fail

984
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,100
No way to get this to drive like this

985
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,100
During their training over the course of two to four years

986
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,400
They feel as if we are studying

987
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,500
We are learning a major

988
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,700
After two to four years, these people

989
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,000
they feel like

990
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,300
This ability is definitely related to the ability to control space

991
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,100
Spatial control

992
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,500
For example, let me tell you now

993
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,300
How to get to the Forbidden City

994
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,540
can anyone get this right now

995
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,800
report it to the boss

996
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,300
Maybe some people in there will know soon

997
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,900
from which road the whole past

998
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,200
Then some people say I am GPS

999
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,460
I can't pass without me

1000
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,580
this is

1001
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,240
There is no space, there is no difference

1002
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,540
so they go and say

1003
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,580
Why do some people have this

1004
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,640
can pass this exam

1005
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,040
trained and passed the exam

1006
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,840
What the hell happened in his head

1007
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,580
what's going on in the brain

1008
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,540
they found out

1009
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,540
in the hippocampus of the brain

1010
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,540
his back area

1011
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
this place

1012
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,380
as long as you pass this exam

1013
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,300
And especially the longer you drive

1014
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,380
that area will get a little bit bigger

1015
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,880
the back half of the hippocampus

1016
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,260
there will be a little

1017
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,560
that use this

1018
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,420
We call this image development

1019
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,260
this came out looking

1020
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,960
It's really a little bigger

1021
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,260
and this

1022
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,660
as long as you drive

1023
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,780
more familiar people

1024
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,060
the bigger the place

1025
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,060
Then you go to see those who failed

1026
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,780
maybe a year and a half

1027
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,580
then what

1028
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,720
that place didn't get bigger

1029
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,860
this place doesn't get any bigger

1030
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,780
this is very special

1031
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,860
That is to say, there is a linear relationship between

1032
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,460
say you are more familiar

1033
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,660
the longer you train

1034
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,460
then you this

1035
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,800
The longer you drive, the bigger your place will be

1036
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
This increased size has something to do with it

1037
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,640
Then you lose no one

1038
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,940
challenge

1039
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,740
Said, maybe this is not related to the experience of driving a taxi

1040
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,240
And maybe this is just a London air move

1041
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,200
Work is stressful

1042
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,200
Then your place may have something to do with your resistance to stress

1043
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,000
or something

1044
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,800
Then they study very simple

1045
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,800
That's easy. I'll just find out the bus driver in London.

1046
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,300
That bus driver breathes dirty air every day.

1047
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,800
And it's a lot of pressure every day.

1048
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Let's look at this area of â€‹â€‹their brain

1049
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
no increase in

1050
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
So in other words, this is driving a taxi

1051
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,300
A special phenomenon of the driver is like this

1052
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,800
Then they also put some

1053
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Later, he stopped, and he said that I am in my 40s and I am going to retire.

1054
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,800
Then you found out that the longer you retire

1055
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
That place shrinks back a little bit like this

1056
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,800
Obviously, that place has a very obvious relationship with the control of space.

1057
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,800
this is an interesting report

1058
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,000
Then everyone here says

1059
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
what about london

1060
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Is there any in New York?

1061
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
or does paris have

1062
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Will the genetic design of Taipei City look like this?

1063
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Does anyone know

1064
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
In fact, if you go to New York or Paris or Taipei

1065
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Our path is actually more

1066
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Four squares, right?

1067
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
especially new york

1068
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And the roads in New York are pretty easy to remember, right?

1069
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
12345678910 Pass like this

1070
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That 12345 looks like this

1071
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So their driver

1072
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Your brain trains you to control this ability

1073
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
There is no need to go to such a strong training like this

1074
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So it can reflect that

1075
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
To become a skill design in London

1076
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
your training is very solid

1077
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
then a certain area of â€‹â€‹your brain

1078
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It really has something to do with space control

1079
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Then after you enter the training

1080
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Your area will grow a little bit like this

1081
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So this in their same research

1082
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
when looking in other cities

1083
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,200
There is no such phenomenon in the ongoing period in other places.

1084
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,200
It's an interesting subject

1085
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,800
so why

1086
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,000
That actually has a price

1087
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,400
Let me tell you about this first

1088
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
In fact, many different industries

1089
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,800
if you've been training somewhere

1090
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,200
There may be some changes in some parts of your brain

1091
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,800
some changes

1092
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,000
Is there a price for this change?

1093
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,000
It means you are very good now

1094
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,600
When you become a professional taxi driver

1095
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,800
Then you'll be able to know where to go

1096
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,400
Your ability to control space has improved

1097
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
In fact, they found that

1098
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,800
Hey, the instant memory ability of these people for an image

1099
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,000
In fact, there are a little worse than the average person

1100
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,600
when one of your abilities becomes stronger

1101
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,100
help him use your nervous system

1102
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,100
When using this function

1103
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,600
Some of your other abilities may disappear like this

1104
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,400
That's quite an interesting way of saying it.

1105
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,200
That

1106
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,900
How did the brain change?

1107
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,000
Why is it about remembering something

1108
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,600
Then it will make a slight change somewhere in you like this

1109
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,200
Well, there's actually a theory

1110
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,400
What this theory actually says is

1111
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Yeah, it's worth mentioning that these people aren't young people or kids.

1112
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,800
We know that the brains of children or young adults may still be developing, so it changes like this

1113
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,000
But these adults are in their twenties

1114
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,400
The brain is actually quite fixed like this

1115
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,000
But there will still be some changes

1116
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,800
How did this change come about?

1117
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,400
We are saying that our memories have a structural plasticity

1118
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,600
The credibility of the structure means that its structure can still be changed

1119
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,600
when we remember something

1120
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,400
This thing if we go through many times of training

1121
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,200
I remember when I was very familiar

1122
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,400
There may be a structural change

1123
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,400
The structure is generally the change in the synapse we just talked about

1124
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,800
A synapse is where two nerve cells meet

1125
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,800
Right, the place where the axon meets the tachyon just mentioned

1126
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
synaptic changes

1127
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Then there is a meaning map

1128
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,800
For example, the junction of these two nerve cells

1129
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,800
this prominent place

1130
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Then there are some molecular mechanisms here that we won't talk about

1131
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It is possible that the protrusion will become larger

1132
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
or split into two

1133
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
touch more strongly

1134
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
tighter

1135
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
it can make a dramatic difference

1136
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So how do we do this experiment?

1137
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
In fact, ours is actually a small experiment.

1138
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But I also thought it was an interesting experiment

1139
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Of course we can't make it too complicated

1140
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
We're going to use this larva of the fruit fly

1141
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
If you can see this

1142
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
here is one

1143
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
here is one

1144
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Did you notice the difference between the two larvae?

1145
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Let's take a look again

1146
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
is there one here

1147
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
little bit

1148
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
here is one

1149
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
This one runs fast

1150
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Something at the same time came here

1151
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It seems that this one is not willing to climb

1152
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
in place like this

1153
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Then we found out that

1154
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
These larvae crawl slowly like this

1155
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
it's this prominent

1156
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,500
It is easier for the motor nerve cells to protrude from the inner surface of the muscle

1157
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,800
But if this larva that's been crawling very fast

1158
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,500
Its prominence will grow a little more complicated

1159
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,500
And this sure enough larva research is relatively simple

1160
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,000
That means we only have to do it for about 8 hours

1161
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,500
we saw that

1162
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Already crawling fast and crawling slowly stand out

1163
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,000
There is a big difference in this growth ratio, like this

1164
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,500
This means that after we become adults,

1165
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Our brains are still somewhat forgiven

1166
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500
when you have been training in a certain place

1167
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,000
The power of your place will become stronger

1168
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But at the same time it is possible that some will lose

1169
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Everything is the same

1170
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
This is a very important concept to tell you about

1171
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
In fact, our brains have just started talking about a lot of protruding things.

1172
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,240
There are more than 14 protrusions in a brain

1173
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,240
Those highlights are recording our life

1174
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,240
Bit by bit like this

1175
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,740
your life experience what you remember

1176
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,240
That's a lot, it's like one

1177
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,240
A previous recorder

1178
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,240
What is this called, a flow machine or something?

1179
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,240
You record it, every time you experience something

1180
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,240
You might just record these things in there

1181
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,240
Then you just remember to call it out next time like this

1182
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,240
OK, it's as if our brain has a record of this

1183
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,240
So the highlight of this new Labs is

1184
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,240
It may be that we accumulate various experiences in our brains

1185
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,240
Memories, so if you listen to me today

1186
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,240
Speech and then if you remember the representative said

1187
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,240
I've left some notes in your salient

1188
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,240
then this is

1189
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
that last

1190
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,240
to mention

1191
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,240
We're actually a favorite subject of late

1192
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,240
That's the one from Sudo

1193
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
Variety

1194
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Diversity and complexity

1195
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Diversity goes without saying

1196
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We've just emphasized a lot

1197
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
look at every nerve cell

1198
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
this ontology

1199
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
We started with nerve cells

1200
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
ontology

1201
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
this is its speed

1202
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Each speed grows very

1203
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
very big difference

1204
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
look different

1205
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
This is basically defined

1206
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
each nerve cell

1207
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
different kinds

1208
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
This also has a lot to do with its function

1209
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
look different

1210
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Its function may be different

1211
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
this

1212
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
In our four nerves

1213
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
actually a lot

1214
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
this kind of

1215
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
speed

1216
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
it has some features

1217
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
For example, we can see that

1218
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
exist

1219
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
inside the eyeball

1220
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The speed of the four nerves

1221
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
you see say

1222
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
One by one is actually arranged

1223
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
fairly neat

1224
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
and you feel like it has

1225
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
certain one

1226
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
a sense of domain

1227
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
have their own field

1228
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
this one

1229
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
with this one

1230
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
probably a certain one

1231
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
a distance like this

1232
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Then everyone has a

1233
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
one

1234
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
a speed

1235
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
such a certain field

1236
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
We know that our eyes need to sense a few things

1237
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
One is to feel the color, right?

1238
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,000
The second is to feel a type, a pattern, and a contrast

1239
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
or a boundary line

1240
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
when we see something

1241
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
where or how its boundaries

1242
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
The third thing to probably look at is a sporty

1243
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
movement of things

1244
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You can talk about our vision mirror

1245
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It may have something to do with where something is in space

1246
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's the kind of neuron that fills the entire eye

1247
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
covered with these dendrites

1248
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
These dendrites can be quite funny sometimes

1249
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
It has something to do with the directionality of the movement of the objects that my eyes see

1250
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
We can have fun looking at the example

1251
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
if you look carefully

1252
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
One by one nerve cells can be seen

1253
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
You see the body of the cell, right?

1254
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Ontology we just talked about

1255
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
This is an axon, a very long axon

1256
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
The axons of each nerve cell gather to

1257
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
go to the same place

1258
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
it this gathers together

1259
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
extend into the brain

1260
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Another interesting thing is that this tree diagram

1261
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
look at this tree diagram

1262
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Notice the consistency of these tree diagrams

1263
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
how are they

1264
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
It's all down and down

1265
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
So you should be able to guess what the function of this thing is

1266
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It may have something to do with detecting the direction of movement of objects outside

1267
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Then their research thinks that

1268
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This may have something to do with the direction some objects are running up

1269
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So within these four nerves

1270
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
It can be seen that there are four kinds of trees, and some tree diagrams are the group that goes down.

1271
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Some are to the right, some are to the left, some are up

1272
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So at least basically we can detect some different directions

1273
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Let's go back to this dissatisfaction

1274
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
nerve cells of dissatisfaction

1275
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So of course we're doing this experiment with fruit flies.

1276
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
What about the fruit fly?

1277
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
We saw that it was a larva

1278
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Then from the nerve cells in the body

1279
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
You see, this is the body one by one

1280
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But its speed is not enough for the whole body

1281
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You see this speed everywhere

1282
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I often feel like the larva is wearing a gold and aluminum coat

1283
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Dissatisfied with the whole body like this

1284
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:18,000
This has a lot to do with the larva's ability to sense external stimuli.

1285
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
This is mainly the induction of two stimuli

1286
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It's a nerve limb called pain sensation

1287
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
feel something harmful

1288
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Harmful stimuli from the outside world

1289
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
one is high temperature

1290
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
For example, if the temperature is higher than 45 degrees

1291
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You pierce it with a needle at 45 degrees

1292
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
you'll find that the larvae will roll to the other side

1293
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
it has a scrolling behavior

1294
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It can also feel strong light

1295
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
When stimulated by strong light, it will run in the other direction

1296
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So we can know that

1297
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
These speeds of the nerve serve two functions

1298
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
One is to feel harmful

1299
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
second what else do you know

1300
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Is the direction of stimulation coming from right?

1301
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
That's why you know what I want

1302
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I'm going to run to the other side

1303
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm going to run to the other side

1304
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
so show everyone this

1305
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
a movie

1306
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
This is always climbing

1307
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Did you see that strong light stimulated it?

1308
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
It escaped and crawled to the other side

1309
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
ok let's see again

1310
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
it crawls to the right

1311
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Then suddenly a

1312
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
glare

1313
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
it just avoids that direction

1314
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So you could conceivably say

1315
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Its whole body is covered with this

1316
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
This is what it says is a harmful irritant

1317
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
a source of

1318
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Because the larva under the strong light

1319
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
May be sun-dried

1320
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
dry it and it may die

1321
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It must have this sure-fire larva

1322
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
may have to hide in food

1323
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Then a humid environment like this

1324
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
so it body it except

1325
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I know it's harmful

1326
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The way it needs to know the source of this light

1327
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So it covers the whole body when it is actually projected to the central nervous system

1328
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It actually has a proper alignment

1329
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Then you can know where the stimulus is coming from

1330
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,000
The research in our laboratory is actually to study several topics of this speed.

1331
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Then I will try to give a few interesting examples like this

1332
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
In fact, we used a lot of relatively high-end microscopes

1333
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You can see that this rate of growth has been moving

1334
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
In fact, we can imagine that it is actually very similar to human beings.

1335
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Our speed is actually the speed inside the body may be growing all the time

1336
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's always changing, it's always moving around like this

1337
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Then our microscope can see the movement of some molecules in the speed

1338
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Then let's slowly tell some interesting stories like this

1339
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Let's look at this first

1340
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Let's take pictures of the dynamics at this speed

1341
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,020
Did you see any behavior

1342
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,180
Actually, we saw how some dendrites

1343
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,440
is extending

1344
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,440
how about some

1345
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,440
shrinking

1346
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,640
Some of them are newborns

1347
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,000
Actually, one thing I find interesting is the behavior of repulsion

1348
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,560
everyone can see

1349
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,600
Both dendrites want to grow

1350
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Then what if they bump into each other

1351
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,200
retracted

1352
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,200
You know, these dendrites all come out of the same nerve cell.

1353
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,200
You think it's the body of the same nerve cell

1354
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,200
Then keep branching and branching

1355
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,200
then come out

1356
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,200
The growth of the dendrites

1357
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,200
it has two principles

1358
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,200
There are two principles

1359
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,200
Just now you saw the amount of dendrites that were dissatisfied from birth

1360
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,200
It is so long there are two principles

1361
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,200
one is to say how

1362
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,200
It wants to dissatisfy the whole body as much as possible

1363
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,200
because you can't have a body have a place

1364
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,200
without that dendrite

1365
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Then if the other side is exposed to high temperature or high

1366
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,000
If you are stimulated by the high gun light, you will not feel it

1367
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
that's dangerous

1368
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
So you have to find a way to increase the speed all the time

1369
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
fill all the space like this

1370
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So it's this velocity that we call space filling

1371
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
That is to say, where there is space, it will quickly extend it.

1372
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
and then want to fill it up

1373
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
what about the second one

1374
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
it has an evasive behavior

1375
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
That is to say, it does not need two speeds in the same space

1376
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
touch together intertwine

1377
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
then go fill it

1378
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
So often two speeds

1379
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
What happens when two speeds of the same nerve cell collide

1380
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
it shrank

1381
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
One shrank or both shrank

1382
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Because I don't want to cover the same place over and over again

1383
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then you can imagine that this is the most economical

1384
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Either the most efficient or a

1385
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
You have to try to fill all the space

1386
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But what if we don't want to have two speeds?

1387
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
touch together and then this

1388
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
to intertwine

1389
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
This is a study, that is, this space-filled neuron

1390
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Then they will grow a lot of soil, and then try to fill this space as much as possible

1391
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
But they try not to touch each other

1392
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So here's a picture, a sure enough picture kind of

1393
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Then you can see that many places are intertwined with each other.

1394
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
These two stick together

1395
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Then some years form a handful, these two stick together

1396
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Do you have a serious habit?

1397
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
They mean that when they meet together

1398
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
They don't know to separate

1399
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
together after we meet

1400
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
OK, so letâ€™s ask, how does a normal dweller know

1401
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
avoidance

1402
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
We are talking about this now, and we are very particular about avoiding self-interest.

1403
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
To know how to avoid yourself like this, how does Sutu avoid yourself

1404
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Then this is a very interesting mutation

1405
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
This gene is called Beware of the Sale of Schimarchy

1406
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
just a soup

1407
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
It is neutralizing positive cell skin molecules like this

1408
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
it's a gene

1409
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
This gene can make 40,000 proteins

1410
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
One gene makes 40,000 proteins

1411
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
the funny thing is to say

1412
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's inside every nerve cell

1413
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
The expressed protein is different

1414
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
This is because gene splicing

1415
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
one gene can make

1416
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
But it's inside every nerve cell

1417
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
The expressed molecules are different

1418
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Because different splicing is different

1419
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So you could conceivably say

1420
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Each nerve cell expresses only a specific

1421
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
protein out

1422
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
The same gene can express different proteins

1423
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Then this is like its ID card

1424
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That is to say

1425
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I just want to express this

1426
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
express one of the proteins

1427
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
from a class of proteins like this

1428
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Then these proteins will go to

1429
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
speed surface up

1430
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
speed surface up

1431
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So when it's two speeds

1432
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
when we touch each other

1433
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
then see

1434
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
This protein is the same

1435
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
so what do we do

1436
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
hold on to each other

1437
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It's a very simple truth

1438
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
That is to say we give

1439
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
One identity card per nerve cell

1440
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,080
Its two dendrites have to touch together

1441
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,400
they can check

1442
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,560
we are the same

1443
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,400
Then we avoid it like this

1444
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,000
So the dendrites of this same neuron

1445
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,320
must avoid

1446
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,840
This is an interesting example

1447
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,520
The other thing to avoid is actually

1448
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,400
quite special that is to say

1449
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,320
we just saw that

1450
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,320
The same goes for the nerve cells on the retina

1451
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,080
Each cell occupies a space like this

1452
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
So we can see that

1453
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,080
this dendrite

1454
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,080
from different cells

1455
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,080
the same nerve cell

1456
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,080
different dendrites

1457
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,080
This is the red cell body here

1458
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,080
This is a green cell body

1459
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,080
their dendrites grow

1460
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,080
just grow up, right?

1461
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,080
they'll get very, very close to each other

1462
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,080
what we just said

1463
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,080
It's going to cover its entire body with dendrites

1464
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,080
So they should be as full as possible

1465
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,080
But they don't want to be intertwined

1466
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,080
so you see some details

1467
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,080
For example, the red and green

1468
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,080
almost all close

1469
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,080
but not together

1470
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
do not touch together

1471
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
They're going to keep building a field

1472
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
The field is bigger the better

1473
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
we can get very close

1474
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
but got very very close

1475
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
They avoid it when approached

1476
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It's just that I don't want to occupy your space

1477
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
you don't come to occupy my space

1478
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Here is a very simple experiment

1479
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
to explain this matter

1480
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
In fact, what we just said is very simple.

1481
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
you use a laser

1482
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
kill this cell

1483
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
kill this cell

1484
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Of course those speeds are gone.

1485
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
so it's easy

1486
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
everyone knows the answer

1487
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
just grow up

1488
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Come over and help him cover

1489
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
this has an area

1490
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
so just cover it

1491
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So this is a very simple example

1492
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
they will build their own domain

1493
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
But they can't exchange each other

1494
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So in this body section

1495
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
There are actually only three of these neurons

1496
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Three blue, green, yellow

1497
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
build your own domain

1498
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
not interchangeable

1499
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
another said

1500
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
speed self avoidance

1501
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Then let's look at this example

1502
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:08,000
In fact, everyone, take a look at this moving

1503
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
watch the color change

1504
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
did you see

1505
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Which color is the tree diagram we are talking about

1506
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
green, right?

1507
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
So we just talked about a psycho

1508
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Then when you look at the red, there are grids of cells, are there any?

1509
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
That's epidermal cells

1510
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Those tree diagrams actually grow under the epidermal cells

1511
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It has a very tight bond with epidermal cells

1512
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Underneath this epidermal cell is this

1513
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
one layer of this

1514
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
The tree map just grows under this skin

1515
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
So outside stimuli

1516
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
These tree diagrams can feel

1517
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Then send the signal over like this

1518
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
so

1519
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
like we actually have researched a little bit of this stuff

1520
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
we found out that

1521
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Eh

1522
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
This is an epidermal cell

1523
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
it's a glove like this

1524
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
one by one like this

1525
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,500
it is tree map red

1526
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,500
It grows under the epidermis like this

1527
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,000
may see say

1528
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Below this tree diagram

1529
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
There are also some green proteins

1530
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,500
It's the same protein as this epidermal cell protein

1531
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,000
So actually this epidermal cell is here

1532
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
is helping the tree graph grow

1533
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,500
assisting its growth

1534
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,000
so that it can be stabilized on this epidermal cell

1535
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,500
it grows

1536
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,500
Epidermal cells may have some protein secretion

1537
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:28,000
stick it on top

1538
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,500
let it stabilize

1539
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,500
Then we just talked about what the tree diagram has

1540
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,500
There are extended and retracted, right?

1541
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,500
if it is so stable

1542
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,500
The tree diagram is less likely to shrink back

1543
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,000
it grows at a constant distance like this

1544
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,500
Those are epidermal cells

1545
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,000
of course we know this

1546
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
not entirely good

1547
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
It also sometimes plays this

1548
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,500
double face role

1549
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,500
What we just saw was an epidermal cell

1550
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,000
A pair of tree diagrams

1551
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,500
growing a stable one

1552
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,000
support

1553
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,500
So here is the same group of epidermal cells

1554
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,240
But they are actually eating the tree diagram

1555
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,600
You see this tree diagram

1556
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,360
This treemap is dying

1557
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,920
you see the whole and disappear

1558
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,880
In this movie that was shot for about half an hour

1559
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,040
You're swallowed when you see a tree diagram

1560
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,280
You see that this tree diagram is cut off more specifically

1561
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,000
You see a little bit of the tail being pulled away like this

1562
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,160
Pull it off and it disappears like this

1563
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,800
So this epidermal cell also

1564
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,800
This is really double-faced

1565
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,960
He supported the growth of this tree map in the early days

1566
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:41,840
Gobble up the treemap at a later stage

1567
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,920
It's an interesting experiment

1568
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,760
I appreciate it every time I watch a movie

1569
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,240
how to swallow this

1570
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,000
This tree diagram this neuron is here

1571
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,040
Ontology is here

1572
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,720
It's very complicated with several strands

1573
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,240
Its tree diagram is going to grow

1574
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,240
to fill the space like this

1575
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,080
we can see say this tree stand

1576
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,720
look at this purple one

1577
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:02,760
it's green

1578
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,600
this black like this

1579
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,000
And then they went to shoot this inside

1580
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,200
signal before being swallowed

1581
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
If you look at the picture on the right

1582
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,000
did you see

1583
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,800
This looks like this lightning

1584
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,000
Suddenly one lighted up, right?

1585
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,800
The first root is here, the second root is there

1586
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,600
Then we look at this diagram that means

1587
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,800
It's not a schematic, it's just

1588
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,720
an image of that single time

1589
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,120
then this one

1590
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,240
this one

1591
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,720
suddenly light up together

1592
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,320
Then this one will be swallowed

1593
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,920
next time this

1594
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,920
all lit up

1595
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,320
Then this one will be swallowed

1596
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,320
that seems to mean

1597
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,720
This diagram is not

1598
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,040
all together all together like this

1599
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,720
In fact there is a

1600
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,320
have a sense of order

1601
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,720
That is to say, one of them is swallowed whole.

1602
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,120
Then the others are later

1603
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,840
just got swallowed like this

1604
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,640
there seems to be a signal

1605
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,320
must accumulate to a certain

1606
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,320
Above critical point

1607
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,920
Then this root diagram will be swallowed like this

1608
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
This is actually a bit like some

1609
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Let's look at one of the neurotransmitter disorders

1610
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
diagram, this is a

1611
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
a cerebellar spinal atrophy

1612
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
a certain kind, this first kind

1613
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
cerebellar spinal atrophy

1614
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Then you saw this one

1615
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Pokinji Cell

1616
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
This art picture originally looked very dense

1617
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Like this, there are several like this

1618
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
It should be said that when the disease occurs

1619
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Sometimes it's like one of them is missing

1620
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
one missing like this

1621
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
The rest of the place looks pretty good.

1622
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
not bad

1623
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So this seems to respond

1624
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
This can be done as a pattern

1625
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
study some diseases

1626
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
In fact, we often say

1627
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
During development these articulations

1628
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It has a lot to do with our nerve cells

1629
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That seems to grow as much as possible

1630
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
The more secretive the better

1631
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
In fact, our development is often not like this

1632
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
We started by talking about our

1633
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Like cells, we do enough

1634
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Then in some places how to

1635
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
let this cell die

1636
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and then be able to construct

1637
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
something pretty with a stretched eye

1638
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
The picture is the same

1639
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
We have a nice model here

1640
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
After the dendrite grows

1641
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,600
at some point it has to be broken

1642
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,600
Then keep the cell body

1643
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,600
Axons also remain

1644
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,100
That's only if the dendrites are all broken.

1645
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,100
What about after it's broken?

1646
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,100
This nerve cell can then grow a new tree protrusion

1647
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,100
Execute the new function like this

1648
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,600
So this dendrite actually has a modification during development

1649
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,600
or the process of shrinking

1650
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,100
fix it like this

1651
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,600
Well, this is actually in human development

1652
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,000
In fact, this phenomenon is also very clear

1653
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
is what we know to say

1654
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
newborn baby

1655
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,500
It is between 0 and 2 years old

1656
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,000
we look at this line

1657
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,500
this normal this line

1658
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
it actually keeps increasing

1659
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,000
The dendrites will keep increasing, right?

1660
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,700
It will increase to 0 when it is about 2 years old

1661
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,700
But then the dendrites start to decrease

1662
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,500
At first it will be reduced to a normal number like this

1663
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,500
Then this may mean doing a little more at the beginning

1664
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,900
Then let the neurons form different grades

1665
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,760
If it's too much then fix it up

1666
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,260
it's a simple idea

1667
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,760
Then we found that the scientist

1668
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,460
We found this diagram that says this modification

1669
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,400
It's actually very important not to grow too much

1670
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,440
For example, when you are autistic

1671
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,220
Some of

1672
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,800
Children will find that his art diagram begins

1673
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,000
is more long

1674
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,080
then too much

1675
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,760
Then he will have the modified

1676
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,120
But it has not been modified to a normal phenomenon like this

1677
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,420
that in certain other developments like this

1678
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,920
traditionally called schizophrenia

1679
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,920
It is now called Sijue Sitiao

1680
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,420
this red line

1681
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,420
you can see say

1682
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,720
when he was growing

1683
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,420
It is normal to increase

1684
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,420
at the top

1685
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,920
He came down with too much grooming

1686
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,920
too much retouching

1687
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:44,420
so

1688
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:48,420
This may be a possibility that caused his thoughts.

1689
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,920
If you are mentally handicapped, that means

1690
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,420
It may not be long enough at the beginning

1691
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,420
Then it will be too much to fix it like this

1692
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,420
So he is also better than the normal picture

1693
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,420
also slightly

1694
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So this is our epiphysis during development

1695
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
There is a process of adding and modifying

1696
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
We want to say that additions and modifications are normal numbers

1697
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
not only in development

1698
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
some geriatric diseases

1699
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
don't talk about geriatric diseases

1700
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
later neurological diseases

1701
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Alzheimer's disease

1702
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Said that the increase in speed is more than

1703
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
This is the body and speed of a normal nerve cell

1704
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
We're seeing Alzheimer's brain degeneration

1705
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
The speed of nerve cells is reduced very much

1706
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
under stress or anxiety

1707
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
under strong pressure

1708
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Its speed will actually decrease accordingly.

1709
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So this provides us with say

1710
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
We want to study the relationship between speed and these diseases

1711
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
We have a body in our laboratory

1712
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Studying this Fear of Spiritual Policing

1713
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
This is mainly a doctor coming to our laboratory

1714
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Very special. He hopes to use Guoying as a model to study the life cycle of Phra Chiang.

1715
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It turned out to be very interesting, so I'll take a moment to report back

1716
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Well, Pa Qingsheng is actually not a doctor, so this may not be very accurate.

1717
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
But Pa Qingsheng at least we know that there are a few characteristics

1718
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
That means fighting and slowing down when prohibited

1719
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Very stiff limbs and heel area Very unstable posture

1720
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Those who are interested can go online to watch some videos, which is actually very clear

1721
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
So what I want to say is that in fact, about two thousand years later

1722
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
During Phra Ching's birth, he found that many words caused

1723
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,000
This is partly due to genetic mutations

1724
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Of course, there is another part that everyone thinks is related to the environment.

1725
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
But there are different theories. Some people think it's mostly genetic.

1726
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
That's because the environmental factor is the most important factor

1727
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,800
it's a matter of age

1728
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,600
This happens when older

1729
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,500
Pagene's chances are higher

1730
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,000
that sometimes you just because you have the gene

1731
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,100
you do not know

1732
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,500
It's just that people may die from various other factors

1733
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,100
Cancer, this, or injury, or something

1734
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,100
so

1735
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,100
so you just didn't

1736
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,500
Didn't live long enough to say let your pagene happen

1737
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,600
But that said you might have this

1738
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,500
genetic mutation in

1739
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,500
That

1740
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,900
He will find that there are many genes in people

1741
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:27,600
this

1742
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,500
They use this PRK Park the most

1743
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,600
This one is named 12345678 to District 18

1744
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,500
That's their normal

1745
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,400
The name of this gene that everyone is calling

1746
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,300
Then

1747
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,800
their protein or something

1748
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,400
That

1749
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,600
I won't talk about it one by one

1750
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,600
But here it is found that

1751
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,300
many genes

1752
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,700
in the state camp

1753
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,000
Probably at least 60-70% of all genes

1754
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,400
in the state camp

1755
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,400
that's weird

1756
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,400
The state camp only lives for 60 days

1757
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,200
that person lives at least

1758
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,700
It takes sixty years for a person to get this

1759
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:57,700
Over 60 years old

1760
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,400
over sixty-five years old

1761
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,000
The gene born of that Depak

1762
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,640
become so tall

1763
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:05,760
So why does this gene exist in the state-run

1764
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,360
In fact, the explanation is quite simple.

1765
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,160
how about a lot of genes

1766
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:13,160
Actually it has its normal function

1767
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,600
It's just because the function of this gene has changed after the mutation

1768
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,960
Then maybe something builds up in the body

1769
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:20,960
when you get old

1770
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,360
It starts producing a change like this

1771
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,560
Of course, the reason is still hard to say

1772
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,920
But what I want to tell you today is

1773
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:31,880
One of these genes is called LORK2

1774
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,960
It also has this gene in the state run

1775
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,600
This gene is actually

1776
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,000
Most commonly found in Parkinson's municipalities

1777
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,960
a gene with a mutation

1778
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,800
Call it Pog8 or call it LORK2

1779
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,200
We all have to be called LORK in the state.

1780
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
it has a protein

1781
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,320
There are many functional regions on the protein, like this

1782
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,520
several areas

1783
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,520
everyone can see

1784
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,520
Then there are many different places on it

1785
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,460
can mutate

1786
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:05,340
We know that our chromosomes come in pairs

1787
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:08,340
But as long as you have one of the chromosomes

1788
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,340
A gene on LRK2

1789
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,840
If a mutation occurs

1790
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,280
Then you add this

1791
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,740
The chances of getting Parkinson's become very, very high.

1792
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,200
There is one of the most famous mutation points

1793
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,340
called G2019S

1794
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:23,400
Everyone can remember this

1795
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,140
Call G2019S

1796
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,000
This is the most commonly found mutation

1797
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,940
Then its this feature

1798
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:35,240
The characteristics of this mutation

1799
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,840
It's a very typical Parkinson's

1800
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,840
Then he made the protein very active

1801
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:46,340
Then they found out that in some of the Jews

1802
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:49,640
Or some North African Jewish arts

1803
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,500
The chances are very, very high

1804
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,000
The probability of this G2019S happening is very high

1805
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,740
Then if you go to Google

1806
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,800
you can find this person

1807
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,400
this very important person

1808
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,400
very important to the world

1809
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,220
A person with a major impact, he also got this G2019S mutant

1810
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:06,960
a co-founder of Google

1811
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,320
Say Brin

1812
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,680
his story is interesting

1813
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:15,320
He was around 2006

1814
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,040
he discovered early

1815
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,120
Discovered around 2000

1816
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,600
His mom has Parkinson's

1817
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,440
Then he always felt that it was the influence of the environment

1818
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,320
It's not genetics, it's environmental influences

1819
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,320
He felt that people with Parkinson's also understood environmental factors at that time

1820
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,320
and then at 20...because he makes a lot of money

1821
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,600
Got Google right?

1822
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,600
He imagined that the money was a lot

1823
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,960
he took a wife

1824
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,640
This lady is a student of biology

1825
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,920
in our field

1826
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,400
Then he pays his wife

1827
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,240
to start a company

1828
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,240
Some people should have heard of this company called 23andMe

1829
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,200
the sequence that can sequence your DNA

1830
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,760
sequence the DNA

1831
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,280
He gave his wife money and started a company like this

1832
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,040
Maybe it was a girl back then...

1833
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Then he also said to sequence your DNA

1834
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
he said yes

1835
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
He sequenced his DNA

1836
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
After the sequence is finished, let's see if we want to take a look

1837
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Is there any mutation?

1838
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
He said okay come and see

1839
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Let's say you really have the G2019S mutation

1840
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
This is really a bit of this exciting

1841
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But I think you can go to that blog to see this

1842
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
he speaks very well

1843
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
He said that he actually thinks he is luckier than everyone else.

1844
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Because he thinks that when people get old

1845
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
always die of a disease

1846
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
don't know what disease

1847
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It's not cancer, it's Alzheimer's disease

1848
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Then he was lucky at such a young age

1849
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
in your 30s

1850
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
You can know what diseases you will get when you get old

1851
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
so he can start now

1852
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Prevention of Parkinson's as a whole

1853
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
let him happen later

1854
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
or reduce the chances of him happening

1855
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
or how like this

1856
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That's just the mutation of G2019S

1857
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
actually full

1858
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
pretty bad mutation

1859
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
The probability of being called Parkinson's is very high

1860
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
very high

1861
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,000
So for him it is

1862
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
A lot of the money he earned has been used to do research on fear of mental evidence

1863
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
study like this

1864
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Our laboratory also did a little bit of the effect of the G2019S mutation on the rapid burst

1865
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
You can see that this is the growth of a normal nerve cell

1866
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
very healthy very good

1867
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
However, if the G2019S mutation is expressed

1868
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Sutu grows sparser than the Sutu here

1869
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
much less, much shorter

1870
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Then it's pretty sparse

1871
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So it's a pretty bad mutation

1872
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:50,000
In human beings, fear of mental evidence will actually lead to a decrease in excess

1873
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
This dohagan is a neurotransmitter

1874
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Then in our highlight from bad to bad

1875
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Then Feimi this multi-octagan

1876
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,360
Send this speed and receive it to the next nerve cell like this

1877
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,380
Then the second is to say

1878
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,660
This neuron that secretes this dopamine

1879
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,760
Nerve cells also become very few

1880
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,320
from this normal to this

1881
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,120
This one has Parkinston's this black

1882
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,200
This one representing this dopamine neuron is gone.

1883
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:19,720
gone

1884
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,120
Then we can also see this experiment in Chinese

1885
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,560
Did you see that we are in Chinese

1886
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,400
Then we can dye these many dopamine nerves

1887
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,400
Then if express G2019S

1888
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,120
This neuron also decreases

1889
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,640
And it is decreasing with time

1890
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,920
decrease over time

1891
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,120
just like people

1892
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,760
Then there are problems with these sure movements

1893
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,240
worse

1894
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,800
Then

1895
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,400
so

1896
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,800
In fact, it can be used to imitate this

1897
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,600
A model of such a study by Parkinston

1898
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:50,720
that here

1899
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,200
This is Dr. Lin in our laboratory

1900
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:56,800
He did a very interesting experiment

1901
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,040
he just said ok then

1902
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:09,000
It is said that this speed can be used as a model to study the Parkinson's reproductive disease of G2019S

1903
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Then is there any antidote that can be found?

1904
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Then we know the US FDA US Food and Drug Administration

1905
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,000
They've probably approved maybe a thousand drugs so far.

1906
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
This drug can treat various diseases in the human body

1907
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Then these drugs are probably harmless to the body.

1908
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
There is a little cure for a certain disease, there are some more or less curative functions like this

1909
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Since these drugs are harmless to the human body, he asked

1910
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Do these drugs have any effect on Parkinson's reproductive disease caused by G2019S?

1911
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Has a positive protective or positive lifting or healing effect

1912
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Then this experiment is unlikely to be done in humans or mice

1913
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
For this person, you need about a thousand kinds of medicines, how many people will it take to test it out, right?

1914
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
the mouse even if the mouse does

1915
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,260
also very very expensive

1916
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:02,940
Rats just have to do one drug experiment

1917
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:05,160
maybe a lot of money

1918
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,160
But in Drosophila

1919
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:06,540
very simple

1920
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:07,700
a laboratory

1921
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,440
a summer vacation

1922
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,040
An experiment that can probably be done

1923
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:10,700
so

1924
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:11,640
we'll do it with fruit flies

1925
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,000
cheap and fast

1926
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,240
So he took this fruit fly

1927
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,440
look at its speed

1928
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,780
this normal

1929
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,940
Then this is the expression of G2019S

1930
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,140
That's in the 1000 drugs

1931
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:21,940
just found out say 1 2 3 4

1932
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,540
There are 4 medicines in total

1933
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,440
And let the speed go back up again

1934
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,200
speed up again

1935
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,000
You saw that the speed increase is not bad

1936
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,280
that seems to shadow

1937
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:33,640
Talk about not doing well for G2019S

1938
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,100
The cause of the boogie is that there is a

1939
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,440
The role of compensation

1940
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,840
or one is one

1941
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,300
Then he took one of the medicines

1942
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,940
This Lobar Stating

1943
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:44,600
do one more research

1944
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,800
Drosophila

1945
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,700
I had a problem with exercise

1946
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,900
It can also make it run a bit better

1947
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,700
and then make it

1948
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,940
The ability to exercise becomes stronger, like this

1949
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,000
many people may know

1950
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,400
What is Lobar Stating?

1951
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:56,640
right

1952
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,000
Stating this medicine

1953
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,900
this this steroids

1954
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,560
this antilipidemic

1955
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,440
then let you this

1956
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:03,840
Then

1957
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,640
Its paper was published in 2016

1958
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,160
Probably published at the beginning of the year like this

1959
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,800
Then at the end of 2015

1960
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,560
There is a clinical trial in the UK

1961
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,200
They used a similar one of a Stating

1962
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:22,040
The drug is called Symbostating

1963
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,280
It is a relatively able to penetrate this

1964
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,440
This drug for the brain-blood barrier

1965
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,360
it can

1966
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,480
because this treats this

1967
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,160
Cholesterol probably doesn't need to get into the brain

1968
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,360
But this Symbostating can enter the brain more easily

1969
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,800
They just experimented and said we're going to try this medicine

1970
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,760
Does it have a protective effect on Parkinson's life?

1971
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,480
that this is not to say

1972
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:40,880
that is

1973
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,720
Well, sure enough research seems to

1974
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,480
actually quite effective

1975
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,120
And these medicines are safe medicines

1976
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:46,680
so you say

1977
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:49,080
Can this be used directly for human experiments?

1978
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:50,360
So what I'm going to say is

1979
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:50,840
Hey this

1980
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,040
Seems like a nice tool indeed

1981
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,120
can be used to make a very simple

1982
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,480
A process of early drug screening

1983
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,920
that seems to work

1984
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Maybe after the whole five years, there should be two or three years left

1985
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Let's see how they fare

1986
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Then use this research, then use it to do research is actually very special

1987
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:20,000
In fact, no one believes that our algal medicines can have any effect on Parkinson's

1988
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:26,000
But for the sheer joy of research, quite a few students want to experiment like this

1989
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Another student, he is in a department of food nutrition

1990
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:37,000
He said that their laboratory is dedicated to studying the protective effect of Tianma on human nerves.

1991
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
They want to see fruit camps, Parkinson's-style fruit camps

1992
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
See if there is a protective effect

1993
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Traditionally we know traditional Chinese medicine

1994
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
In fact, this is what people have used for thousands of years, and it is harmless to the human body.

1995
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
And it has some protective effect

1996
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's just how to protect it

1997
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
or to protect some kind of disease

1998
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Now medical progress should be defined more clearly

1999
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Then can we repeat some experiments to see

2000
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
is this pegasus

2001
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
have this effect

2002
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
In fact, the tradition used to be a lot like

2003
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
hypocrites

2004
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
he said early on

2005
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
He also said that the food

2006
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
is your medicine

2007
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
let medicine be your food

2008
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
That's actually what we call the homology of the history of medicine in Chinese.

2009
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Then you have heard many stories about Li Qingyun

2010
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I don't know if that is true or not

2011
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
But you can Google it

2012
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Claimed to be born in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty

2013
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
that lived until the Republic of China

2014
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
This one person in 20 years

2015
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Also reported in the New York Times

2016
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Also reported on the Washington Post

2017
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
But to be honest, no one

2018
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
can fully prove it

2019
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
However, when he was interviewed

2020
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
When interviewed during the Republic of China, he said

2021
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
He uses Chinese medicine as his

2022
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
this food looks like this

2023
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
A concept of homology in the history of medicine looks like this

2024
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So let's take a look

2025
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
this right

2026
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Does Tianma have any protective effect on Parkinson's?

2027
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Well, it's very clear for everyone to see this.

2028
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
This experiment is actually very simple

2029
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Then we also found some high school students to do the experiment

2030
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,000
You'll see it says this is a control group experiment

2031
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
This is what G2019S just said

2032
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Then what we want is that the fruit fly can climb over this 8 cm line

2033
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
So we knock the flies down to the very bottom

2034
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
See how many fruit flies can climb 8 cm in one time

2035
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Let's just videotape and see how many go by

2036
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Then you can see that when the G2019S mutation is said

2037
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Lots of fruit flies just stay down there

2038
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It doesn't pass too much, and it doesn't move too much.

2039
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Only two or three have climbed here

2040
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
only three passed

2041
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Most of the others are below

2042
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Can't go up

2043
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
There are quite a few more in the control group

2044
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
So we fed it different doses of this pegasus in the fruit fly

2045
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,820
0.1% 0.5% 1.0% of the time

2046
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:04,600
you see say

2047
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,800
This same G2019

2048
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,800
Some really started to climb well.

2049
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,520
Climbing well is more than 8 cm line

2050
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,840
Then we can see that the statistics here also say the same.

2051
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,400
To pegasus when we can see say

2052
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,960
It actually has an effect

2053
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,160
Can make it climb over 8 cm

2054
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,840
That is to say, to restore its athletic ability

2055
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,600
Then let's look at the growth of speed

2056
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,600
The speed of growth has also returned to this way

2057
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,160
this is an experiment

2058
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,120
And it is really Parchment

2059
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,800
So there is nothing to tell you here

2060
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,800
But don't try too casually.

2061
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:43,600
However, traditional Chinese medicine of Tianma

2062
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,600
It manufactures that it is essential for the blood circulation of the brain

2063
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,600
or everything is very good

2064
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,200
The memory is very good like this

2065
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,200
then we just want to say to study

2066
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,200
Because there are some chemical components in Tianma

2067
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,600
The most important thing is a component called Gastroding

2068
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,000
Then we want to say look at these chemical molecules

2069
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Or because traditional Chinese medicine is a rich prescription

2070
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
often several

2071
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Then we want to try to see which ones are added to which ones.

2072
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
that has a better effect

2073
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
At the same time, we also want to see

2074
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
how did it come about

2075
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
suppress this

2076
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Parkinson's called this

2077
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
The effect is like this

2078
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
at the cellular level

2079
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
What the hell is it doing to the cells

2080
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Then this really reminds everyone

2081
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Because we have different models in the fruit camp

2082
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Parkinson's name

2083
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Another Parkinson's

2084
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
another model

2085
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
it doesn't work at all

2086
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
that this is very special

2087
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
we feel

2088
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Maybe this Pegasus is for a certain type of Parkinson's

2089
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
only effective

2090
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
For some classes, it is not necessarily the effect

2091
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Now let's talk about precision medicine

2092
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
we need to know

2093
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
If you have Parkinson's

2094
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
What kind of mutation

2095
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
let you get this certificate

2096
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
then sick

2097
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Then what special

2098
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
probably everyone

2099
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
The way to treat is different

2100
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So we wish to say

2101
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
our research on this

2102
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
theoretically

2103
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Parkinson's theory

2104
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
There are some contributions like this

2105
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
so i see my time is about

2106
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
So finally I want to thank the lab

2107
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
former student

2108
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and postdoctoral

2109
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
this is us

2110
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,160
When we got together a few years ago, we took a big group photo like this

2111
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,520
Then this is many former students

2112
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,400
Here's what it looks like back with a postdoctoral fellow

2113
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,840
And now there are still many students in the laboratory

2114
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,840
Taken before Chinese New Year this year

2115
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,360
Everyone is wearing red clothes

2116
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,800
The Year of the Golden River Dog in Western Ocean looks like this

2117
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,680
I won't list them all because there are too many names.

2118
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,240
Then we have many collaborators

2119
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,040
Like this at home and abroad

2120
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:29,360
So I'm just reporting here

2121
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,400
And thank you all for listening

2122
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,520
Thank you, Mr. Jane, for your wonderful speech.

2123
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,520
From his research using Drosophila from the basis of neurodevelopment

2124
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,960
to disease research

2125
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:46,960
find drugs that might work

2126
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,160
let's wait

2127
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,600
Open to everyone to ask questions

2128
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,520
We will give a prize and a small gift to the top ten

2129
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,840
This is the 90th anniversary of the Central Plains

2130
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,600
It is a coaster for our 1992 anniversary celebration this year

2131
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,700
Also before you ask

2132
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:13,320
Let me first announce that our next month is December

2133
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,840
December 25th

2134
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,920
Our feast of knowledge is served by our

2135
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,020
Researcher Peng Xiaoyan, Institute of Chinese Culture and Philosophy

2136
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,300
he gave the lecture

2137
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,320
assassin

2138
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,600
Evil food

2139
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,960
This is a movie by Hou Hsiao-hsien

2140
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,800
His answer is Hou Hsiao-hsien's Tang China

2141
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,320
welcome everybody

2142
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,640
Come to listen to the lecture next month

2143
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,200
then we're open right now

2144
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:41,720
ask questions

2145
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,040
then our online friends

2146
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,360
You can also send us questions through that Facebook

2147
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:50,180
Let's give priority to asking questions on the spot

2148
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:50,940
please

2149
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,880
sure enough larvae

2150
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,420
where are you

2151
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
it's not that active

2152
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
But when its foot starvation is that one

2153
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
it is very active

2154
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
But with the G2019S on this side

2155
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
It is relatively inactive

2156
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
is there any difference

2157
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
or something different

2158
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
or because it lacks food

2159
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
but it is normal

2160
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
But because of lack of food

2161
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
is to let it driving force

2162
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
always looking for food

2163
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
But it has no energy

2164
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
so i understand

2165
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Thank you

2166
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000
wow you

2167
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
You looked at my picture carefully.

2168
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I deliberately avoided talking

2169
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
still noticed by you

2170
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
that just now that foot supply

2171
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
That is an experimental condition

2172
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
An Experimental Situation

2173
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Because we thought of two ways

2174
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,000
make fruit flies crawl faster

2175
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I can never tell fruit flies

2176
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
you climb faster

2177
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
So there are two ways

2178
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
One is to increase the temperature a little bit

2179
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
At this time, fruit flies move

2180
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
just faster

2181
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
that's what we worry about

2182
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Results of our experiments

2183
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
You want to say that it is because of the influence of temperature

2184
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
rather than a crawling issue

2185
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
So we have another situation

2186
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
That means leaving the flies without food

2187
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
this one with food

2188
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,240
then you think it's easy

2189
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:03,240
There is food to move

2190
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,440
just hide in the food

2191
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,240
Started going out to find food when there was no food

2192
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,000
what are you doing

2193
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,400
So the one without food really started crawling around

2194
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,440
looking for food like this

2195
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:12,640
So the case of our two different experiments

2196
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,800
then come

2197
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,840
This is exactly the same as ever

2198
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,600
just the situation

2199
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,000
The conditions of the experiment are different

2200
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,200
See what it looks like with that prominent growth

2201
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,440
So that's a set of experiments

2202
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,600
What about this group of experiments

2203
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,600
It's really all for the baby.

2204
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,440
is in the same food

2205
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,440
just have a food with pegasus

2206
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:31,640
Pegasus in a food

2207
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,840
when we're just doing experiments

2208
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,640
Just take it to the empty pipe and do it

2209
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,440
It used to eat the baby like this

2210
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,040
good

2211
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:38,880
ask that

2212
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,280
Or want to send some islands

2213
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,720
That batch really

2214
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,880
Those two batches really

2215
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,280
They are all LOMO

2216
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,720
There is no such G2019S

2217
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,480
yes

2218
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,320
Thank you

2219
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:49,880
Thanks

2220
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:52,920
Excuse me

2221
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,840
that generally speaking

2222
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,720
Crabpena

2223
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,960
Why does it go along the nerve

2224
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,020
Is it related to the protrusion of the nerve?

2225
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,420
I didn't hear the first sentence

2226
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:09,520
Is there any snake skin that people talk about?

2227
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:14,660
snake skin is an allergy

2228
01:29:14,660 --> 01:29:17,260
I think it's a foam pillow

2229
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,000
Yes, it's an immune system problem

2230
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,760
Does that have anything to do with the nervous system?

2231
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,500
that's a good question

2232
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:26,000
But our neural network

2233
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,760
in the body that nerve

2234
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,420
Zhou Tu Sutu actually looks very good

2235
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,420
If I hadn't suddenly shown you

2236
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:35,020
In fact, the underlying dissatisfaction with this nerve

2237
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:36,920
This, Zhoutu and Sutu

2238
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,420
so yes

2239
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,060
I don't think so

2240
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,220
I don't know if it's related, sorry

2241
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,420
a hello

2242
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:54,820
What I want to ask is that just now

2243
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,920
That's what Dr. Jane mentioned

2244
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:58,920
it's fast

2245
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,920
he will just follow

2246
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,400
Epidermal cells have interactions between

2247
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,640
I'm more curious about

2248
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:09,240
When the epidermal cells eat up the tree soil one by one

2249
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:14,040
Where is it to make it break

2250
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:19,560
Is it a weaker place or where it breaks off?

2251
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:21,560
this is a good question

2252
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,120
How to cut it off is arbitrary

2253
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,200
But it seems to be broken section by section

2254
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,520
The process of breaking it is actually quite special.

2255
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,680
that is to say every

2256
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:37,480
In fact, this can show a phenomenon of neurodegeneration

2257
01:30:37,480 --> 01:30:40,200
When the nerve degenerates, this tree soil or axis soil

2258
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,720
When broken, there are two forms

2259
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,240
One we call Dying back

2260
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:50,280
That is to say, it starts from the tail of the stomach and dies to the body of the cell.

2261
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,640
section by section is broken

2262
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,240
When these two places are already injured

2263
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:56,720
After your side is broken, its tree soil or shaft soil is useless

2264
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,840
It started to die all the way to the body

2265
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:06,140
The other is like this, a pretty uniform one, and everyone cuts it off at the same time.

2266
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:10,500
The model I just mentioned is the second model, which means that it is actually quite uniform

2267
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,060
start everywhere

2268
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,340
the process is to say

2269
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:19,720
It is very special, in fact, it is a very special model, that is to say, it is close to the cell body at the beginning

2270
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,000
will be cut first

2271
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:26,360
How to cut this knife, in fact, is now a very important one in this field in the study of people

2272
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:29,180
The second is the knife, once it touches the body

2273
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:30,720
after leaving

2274
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,540
It starts to get empty inside, some of it

2275
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,600
If you're a biology student, something called microtubules will start

2276
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,660
break off, and then it's

2277
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,460
The membrane on the surface will start to have some

2278
01:31:41,720 --> 01:31:43,780
Start with a pig, pig, pig, see what you see

2279
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,060
pig pig pig pig, then

2280
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,080
At this moment

2281
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:48,900
This epidermal cell will give it

2282
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,700
Recycle like this, eat it up and recycle like this

2283
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,580
As for which side is recycled first and which side is later, it is actually still under study.

2284
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,660
Thank you, teacher

2285
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,480
The teacher just talked about this

2286
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,600
London's taxi driver's hippocampus

2287
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,780
i think it's very interesting

2288
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,680
the problem is

2289
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,980
it got bigger and smaller

2290
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:15,580
This process is because its cell body itself becomes larger

2291
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,080
or more prominent

2292
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,280
Or the number of cells changed

2293
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,720
then the second is

2294
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,520
When we were in college every time we hung out

2295
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:23,780
That female classmate said

2296
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:25,020
You have a better sense of direction

2297
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:26,460
you drive you ride

2298
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,360
I don't know if it's true or not

2299
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:30,080
I don't know if there is any research

2300
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,160
Is there any difference between boys and girls?

2301
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,360
I can't answer the second question

2302
01:32:34,360 --> 01:32:36,220
because there are a lot of women

2303
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:38,360
Ha ha ha ha

2304
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,000
That

2305
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,700
actually i remember

2306
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:45,300
Grandson Mi's wife has a very good sense of direction

2307
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,460
I remember as long as

2308
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,100
You tell her casually about a certain point in Taipei City

2309
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:48,840
she can say right away

2310
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:50,240
how to go how to go

2311
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:51,680
I can talk to you on the phone

2312
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,780
don't need this

2313
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,180
and react immediately

2314
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,020
Netizens turn to the host to turn like this

2315
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,180
There will be a difference between men and women

2316
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I can't answer what I've learned

2317
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
what's the first question

2318
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Why is it a change in nerve cells or a prominent change

2319
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
In fact, this question is also a very good question.

2320
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Your question is on point

2321
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,000
it's not clear what's going on

2322
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
it's not clear what's going on

2323
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Because it looks like a group of functional images

2324
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
a large area

2325
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
no way to see in depth

2326
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
A few nerve cells are not deep enough

2327
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Not enough resolution

2328
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
So I kind of want to jump over and tell him to stand out

2329
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
It's actually the one that built the driver in London

2330
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
we didn't know that

2331
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I'm Lin Xiumei

2332
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I've been in radiation oncology for 20 years

2333
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
as an administrative assistant

2334
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,500
So this IC bag and poo are very interested

2335
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,500
After leaving the hospital in 1993, I did community visits

2336
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,500
So now the election is over

2337
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:15,500
That referendum, not the gender identity part

2338
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:21,500
Because today's focus is that this gene is expressed during the mating period

2339
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,000
that has already decided his fate

2340
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,500
So is this gender orientation determined at birth?

2341
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,500
Because while I'm doing community visits

2342
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:35,500
I also met mommy mommy gay women

2343
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:40,000
Going to that foreign country to learn Buddhist scriptures and raising children

2344
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,500
They are very serious and well prepared to do this

2345
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,500
That's doing NHS long-term follow-up of teenagers

2346
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:51,500
There is also a little boy who wanted to be a girl since elementary school

2347
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
I'm totally a long-term visit

2348
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:57,000
Elementary school, middle school and high school to his university to serve in the army

2349
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
That's for sure he wants to be a girl

2350
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,600
So he works part-time to make money during this process

2351
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:08,400
And then by the time I'm done visiting he's actually headed south

2352
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:12,200
So because I'm all my own case

2353
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:16,800
So I am very acceptable to this gender orientation

2354
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,400
But why is this turbulent referendum so chaotic

2355
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,800
Thanks

2356
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:29,000
I can't give any comments on the part of the referendum

2357
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:36,400
I think if it's just creatures, most of them are hermaphrodites.

2358
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,000
You evolved to say male or female it's a

2359
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
But there are many kinds of living things

2360
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:48,000
OK, then we also know that there are more than one or seven birds

2361
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Many creatures also have childishness, even fish can change sex

2362
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,400
Even in research there's something called parthenogenesis

2363
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,800
In terms of biology, it has a lot of diversity

2364
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,820
That person has been difficult for us recently, and I don't know how to say it

2365
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:08,000
I also sympathize

2366
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,500
Thank you

2367
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:16,200
The last one and the one over here

2368
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,800
Then after this one, then that one

2369
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,300
hello professor i would like to ask

2370
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:28,100
Because in the past few days, it seems that there is a

2371
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:31,600
Gene-edited babies

2372
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:36,100
Then he said that he could exempt AIDS patients

2373
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,100
So what do you think the professor thinks about this news?

2374
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,100
This thing must be wrong

2375
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,400
It's about things, it's not that the news is wrong

2376
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,600
something is wrong

2377
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:49,800
Because any experiment on humans has to go through

2378
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,200
Strictly because this is too risky

2379
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,600
This is too risky. I think this person is for fame.

2380
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,000
Because I heard that their technology

2381
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,200
Chris Pratt This technique

2382
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,500
In Hong Kong, it seems that a conference will be held in these two days

2383
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,200
he was one of the speakers

2384
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:07,120
is that ahead of the news

2385
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,620
just make a splash or something

2386
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:12,300
We feel that this kind of thing is ethical in this research

2387
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,300
we are to follow

2388
01:37:14,300 --> 01:37:16,800
It means following all the rules like this

2389
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,860
Why do we need state-run operations? Because there are actually very few regulations on state-run operations

2390
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:22,460
How do we kill and harvest

2391
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,260
But being a mouse requires a lot of rules

2392
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:29,760
Then when it comes to people, I think this is almost what it should be

2393
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,520
I don't think it's advisable

2394
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:34,980
thank you professor

2395
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:38,420
hello that professor i think

2396
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,420
that's me to that one just now

2397
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:43,520
Itâ€™s just that the devouring part is a bit brutal

2398
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:46,520
I'm very interested, and I want to ask if there is one just now

2399
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,520
Is that the Flash movie?

2400
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:51,020
Then I want to ask him that

2401
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:53,560
The mechanism of lightning is because

2402
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,560
Did Membre Procuretio change so that caused him to flash like this?

2403
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,800
The first one is to use Eocasium's reporter

2404
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:05,500
I think you probably learned this

2405
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:09,500
Then they feel that Membrane has a potential change

2406
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:13,500
So all of a sudden it's a little easier to activate

2407
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,500
Suddenly

2408
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:18,500
In fact, it is more understandable why it looks like a lightning bolt.

2409
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:21,500
just light up instead of saying this everywhere

2410
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:22,500
do you know what i mean

2411
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,500
why this one

2412
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:24,500
then down again

2413
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:28,000
There is no certain order of which one comes first and which one comes after.

2414
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I know that in terms of a single one it is that one suddenly is

2415
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,500
Because things outside the mold flow into that electric grid

2416
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,500
so changing their potential

2417
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,500
learn

2418
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:40,500
Thanks

2419
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:43,500
ok i have two questions

2420
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,500
First, some people often dream

2421
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:48,000
Make that teacher dream the same dream

2422
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,500
He will eventually become his memory

2423
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,000
That is to say, he will also be like that

2424
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
As you said, some Synapse forms

2425
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:58,500
second question

2426
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,000
that's what i think

2427
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,160
It seems that Alzheimer's is almost as much as this Parkinson's

2428
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:09,480
So I'm very interested in the Pegasus effect you found

2429
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:15,480
Can it prevent PD? Or is it only effective through the BBB?

2430
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,480
this is a good question

2431
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,980
This is a good question

2432
01:39:20,180 --> 01:39:22,180
Will dreaming change the new nefs?

2433
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,480
I...

2434
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,480
should be

2435
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:27,320
Don't talk about dreaming

2436
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:30,320
In fact, someone went to see the inside of these new nefs...

2437
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:31,320
ah sorry

2438
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,320
Highlight the expression of the protein inside

2439
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,320
In fact, day and night are very different

2440
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,320
The outstanding structure, the outstanding composition looks like this

2441
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,320
then i want to dream

2442
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,320
sometimes you do remember

2443
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,320
then you can also take it as an experience

2444
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,320
it may make some changes to some prominence

2445
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:48,320
i think it should be

2446
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,320
that looks like my daughter probably

2447
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,320
she dreamed she remembered

2448
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:52,320
She got up and told me what she did

2449
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
I probably don't even remember what dreams I had.

2450
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,320
I don't know where the difference is

2451
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,320
Well, I probably haven't done enough research on dreams.

2452
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,560
The second question is that PD and ADO

2453
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:08,840
In fact, Tianma is quite expensive.

2454
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:14,100
This stinky coincidence actually I think

2455
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,900
Maybe we can change our lives and try today.

2456
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:17,860
Maybe it will work

2457
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:21,300
take a what turmeric tree

2458
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:22,400
you can listen to a lot

2459
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:26,600
These are some of the protective effects on the human body

2460
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,800
Food or Chinese medicine like this

2461
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,960
So I think from the point of view of protection and maintenance

2462
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,500
In fact, there are no shortcomings, that's all I can say

2463
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,800
But if you think this can be treated

2464
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,200
or what when i think

2465
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,700
Actually, I have an experiment I want to tell you about

2466
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:44,500
You might actually feel a little disappointed

2467
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,500
Our fruit battalions are actually

2468
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:51,600
We started feeding Pegasus to it as soon as it was born

2469
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:56,800
So let it grow strong and healthy from an early age

2470
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,900
So let's try to say let it start

2471
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,400
When he is afraid of spiritual administration, let him feed the gods

2472
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,000
that's not invalid

2473
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,600
Probably for a week

2474
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,200
that effect

2475
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,400
Then a week later he started falling again

2476
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:16,200
Started to look sick again

2477
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,600
So the effect is not like

2478
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,000
The effect of us being born and starting to feed

2479
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,200
that's why this gesture

2480
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,000
It can also be said that there are some effects

2481
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,600
Then if you live in camp for 60 days

2482
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,600
we figured it out

2483
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:31,400
This week might be equal to seven human years.

2484
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:34,200
If the seven-year increase

2485
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,800
good exercise health

2486
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:37,200
It's actually not bad

2487
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,200
It's just whether our thing can

2488
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,800
transform it into a human

2489
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,000
This is still to be studied

2490
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,200
Then we just want to say that it's okay for people

2491
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,800
Hello

2492
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
thank you professor for your speech

2493
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,800
because there are two important messages

2494
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,400
I want to ask

2495
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,000
The first important message is to say

2496
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,080
The evolutionary degeneration of this brain activation

2497
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,000
it has a protein pattern

2498
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,440
No, that electropowder

2499
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:11,440
Electropowder pattern protein

2500
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,640
it can control

2501
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:13,560
is it true

2502
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:14,240
the second

2503
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,640
This one is called expansion fish

2504
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,040
This dimensional creature

2505
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,840
it can transfer this memory

2506
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,840
Can these two phenomena

2507
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:22,840
please explain

2508
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:23,440
Thanks

2509
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,640
Yes, I don't quite understand the second question

2510
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,040
Expansion fish

2511
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,200
A kind of vitamin

2512
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:33,360
Seems

2513
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,720
Seems

2514
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:37,000
Its head looks like a snail

2515
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,360
but it doesn't have that shell

2516
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,200
it is a mollusc

2517
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:40,960
Broadfish

2518
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:42,560
Applecia

2519
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:45,760
what is the problem with applecia

2520
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,360
that first question

2521
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,960
Ebeta cumulative this is

2522
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:50,840
Inside Alzheimer's

2523
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,560
one of the most common phenomena

2524
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:54,600
There's a lot of politics here

2525
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,600
some say it's harmful

2526
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,360
that some say yes

2527
01:42:58,360 --> 01:42:59,960
In fact, it is protective

2528
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,520
Why because it means your nerve cells start

2529
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:05,120
produces an accumulation of protein and then it

2530
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,820
it actually pushes it outside where it accumulates

2531
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:09,940
That's a protective effect on nerve cells

2532
01:43:09,940 --> 01:43:12,540
then many people

2533
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:16,320
When they did that autopsy, they passed away.

2534
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,680
Although they have Alzheimer's disease

2535
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:21,120
It can be found that there are actually

2536
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:23,920
The accumulation of this endoamylose, this AÎ²

2537
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,520
What is this thing with

2538
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:29,320
Alzheimer's disease is now believed by many people

2539
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:32,280
But is it completely related?

2540
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,240
Everyone has a little bit of this problem

2541
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,080
Then this has a great impact on the development of drugs

2542
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:40,000
Because many people take this amyloid AÎ² thing

2543
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,640
to be a target

2544
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:47,240
Then he said that looking for medicine can prevent its aggregation like this

2545
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:51,600
Then it will, you just asked that it will not spread, right?

2546
01:43:52,600 --> 01:43:55,520
It can control its evolutionary degradation

2547
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,560
It needs this to control if it evolves

2548
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,760
Maybe it's a matter of the quantity.

2549
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:04,600
it can add k and subtract

2550
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,800
can increase its

2551
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,500
to increase or decrease to increase

2552
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:10,500
it reduces its function

2553
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,300
to control its function

2554
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:13,500
function

2555
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,400
It says it can solve this geriatric syndrome

2556
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,000
then i don't know it's true

2557
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,500
Alzheimer's to the present

2558
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,000
Seriously it's not the same

2559
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,300
Check this out online

2560
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:24,800
There is indeed this thing

2561
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,700
That is to say, if the information

2562
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,000
is possible

2563
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
no medicine yet sorry

2564
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,500
as far as i know

2565
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,000
There is no effective medicine

2566
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,500
This answer does not answer no problem

2567
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,000
We just say there is this message

2568
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,500
We know this thing

2569
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:41,700
someone is working on this

2570
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,700
That is to say, the future

2571
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:46,000
Our old man's disease can be solved

2572
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Alzheimer's disease is this

2573
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
This symptom can be resolved

2574
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
our health insurance

2575
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,500
It now has 2.8 million of this age

2576
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:57,000
Human life has been extending since it was opened

2577
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
but this

2578
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
this human life

2579
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,200
What happened to him after the scene

2580
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:04,500
That is to say, the old man has his own administration and the bearer

2581
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,000
Will this rate of increase also increase?

2582
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Is it that there will be social problems?

2583
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Let's solve this problem from this aspect

2584
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Thanks

2585
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
people will be interesting

2586
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Finally there will be a disease

2587
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
The current parlance is to talk about healthy aging

2588
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
the one you had before you died

2589
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
It is not healthy for Taiwan to average 9 to 10 years now

2590
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
there is a problem here

2591
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
can i talk

2592
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Because Yang Zhiliang, Director of Health Yang Zhiliang said

2593
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
His goal

2594
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
He is old and never ends

2595
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
But this old and final

2596
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
He is in a hurry, everything is a disease

2597
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
He said that this cancer from 100%

2598
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Up to now it is 100% and has been reduced to 30%

2599
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Of course after 37% is resolved

2600
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
The focus of his medical

2601
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
where is he going to put it

2602
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I think it might be above Laojihezhong

2603
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Then the progress of our brain

2604
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
If he can solve human problems

2605
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
then everyone is like a young man

2606
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Can be lively and dare to run and jump

2607
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
that's a very good thing

2608
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Thanks

2609
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Okay, are there any other questions on site?

2610
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Hello teacher, I have a question

2611
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It's the old man who eats diarrhoea.

2612
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Parkinson's disease is irreversible

2613
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
using drugs

2614
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It's just a delay

2615
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
is that so

2616
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
That is to say, to delay the aggravation of the disease

2617
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Is it getting heavier all the time?

2618
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Is that how it works?

2619
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Yes, roughly speaking, it may be true.

2620
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
But now I am most afraid of fitness disease

2621
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
The latest treatment they're experimenting with is a modality

2622
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
what japan is doing is to say

2623
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Hit stem cells to

2624
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
stem cell

2625
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
stem cell aging

2626
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
stem cells into the brain

2627
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
dopamine zone

2628
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,760
Then this can replenish new nerve cells

2629
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,760
So this is no longer

2630
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:06,600
You can imagine that could be replaced by

2631
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:10,060
It's not just slowing down those nerve cells.

2632
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:13,400
That is to say, fear of mental loss can be dealt with in this way.

2633
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:15,560
in test

2634
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,600
they are testing

2635
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,320
They are doing human experiments

2636
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,860
Then I always thought he was completely irreversible

2637
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:23,560
right

2638
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:24,600
Thanks

2639
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,200
Is that a human experiment?

2640
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,300
yes

2641
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:29,600
That's one of the Lobel speakers

2642
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,400
their school

2643
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:33,500
he made that

2644
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,600
IPS that

2645
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:36,700
what's that chinese name

2646
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:37,300
right

2647
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:39,700
that stem cell therapy

2648
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:42,500
they lead that out of a

2649
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,600
this nerve cell

2650
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:45,500
and then import it into the brain

2651
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:46,300
then they this

2652
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:47,900
This is much different from what China said just now.

2653
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:50,300
they are strict

2654
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:51,500
this test

2655
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:52,300
RB pair

2656
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:54,900
Then everything fits after

2657
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,600
Dare to do this test like this

2658
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,200
Li Qingyun mentioned by the professor just now

2659
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,000
on the internet

2660
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,400
means it's 256 years old

2661
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,640
then under the same circumstances

2662
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,640
can we find this

2663
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,560
It can live to be 256 years old

2664
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,240
What about creating this same environment to increase human lifespan?

2665
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:16,000
Yes or no

2666
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,840
There are indeed several places in the world

2667
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,640
The average life expectancy of people is longer

2668
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,720
There is a longevity village in Japan, Italy or something

2669
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:29,240
So is it genetic or genetic?

2670
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,480
The relationship between the environment can actually be studied like this

2671
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,440
there is an average

2672
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,240
That is to say, you today, Li Qingyun, are alone

2673
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:37,960
one example

2674
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,520
For us to do experiments and do science

2675
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:42,040
N equals E is unreliable

2676
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:44,760
We all want N equal to several

2677
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:46,840
We will say that this is preferable

2678
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:49,840
Then part of Li Qingyun should be

2679
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,200
I don't know if it should be a rumor

2680
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:53,640
Because it's all word of mouth about this guy.

2681
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:57,000
Some people say that my grandfather heard it when he was young

2682
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,400
Li Qingyun this person

2683
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,000
so to speak

2684
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,880
Retweet and say that this was in the pre-dragon period

2685
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,840
Read it online, the story is very interesting and exciting

2686
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,080
But then this this

2687
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,340
Newspapers are reporting this

2688
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:12,080
But that New York Times 100 years ago

2689
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,180
Who knows if there will be false reports?

2690
01:49:14,180 --> 01:49:15,580
So you can go and see

2691
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:17,680
as entertainment news

2692
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,880
I think it's good

2693
01:49:20,380 --> 01:49:22,080
that's not to mislead people

2694
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:28,400
Okay, is there anyone here with any questions?

2695
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:31,900
No, we have a network here

2696
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:34,400
Ask Mr. Jane what I have learned so far

2697
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,700
Molecular Mechanisms of Artmap Degradation

2698
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:39,400
Causality with electrophysiological properties

2699
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,400
is due to the degradation of the molecule

2700
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:47,400
Does static ear cause the degradation of electrophysiological properties?

2701
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:52,400
Or the electrophysiological changes will be reversed

2702
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,400
cause genetic changes

2703
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,400
Both directions are possible

2704
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:00,400
That is to say, its electrophysiological properties are basically

2705
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,400
Even the conduction in electrogenesis actually relies a lot on protein

2706
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:09,680
The Membrane protein channel on the cell surface

2707
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,680
or something

2708
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:13,680
Then there is a problem with these proteins, there is a problem with speed

2709
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:14,840
then the protein decreases

2710
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:16,680
That will of course cause changes in the electrophysiology

2711
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,000
What's not normal in that electrician

2712
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,960
For example, a conduction that is too strong, conduction of electricity

2713
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,080
That could also cause injury at the speed itself

2714
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:28,320
Then I think both ways are possible

2715
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,000
Okay, the second question is

2716
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,320
I would like to ask whether Parkinson's is the same as the general aging condition

2717
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:39,640
Is the molecular mechanism of his neurotic speed retreat different?

2718
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,400
i think it's different

2719
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:44,320
This can be seen that this found the gene

2720
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,760
Parkinson's has genes like Parkinson's own

2721
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:49,320
Alzheimer's this Alzheimer's this other kind of gene

2722
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,080
These genes are actually different

2723
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:56,400
So it should be. I think the molecular mechanism may be different.

2724
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,080
Well, is there any problem at the scene?

2725
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
i want to ask a question

2726
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Suppose the results of this experiment shown here

2727
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
you give it gastrodia elata

2728
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
0.1% is very effective

2729
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Then 0.5% and 1% are not very effective

2730
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:18,000
So does this mean that eating too much won't help?

2731
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
right

2732
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
that

2733
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
We've tried other bases and it's shown here

2734
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Its 0.02% doesn't do much either

2735
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
So swallowing it is actually 0.1% which is the most effective.

2736
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Then we know that the reaction to this drug is often a

2737
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Are they called U-SHIPs?

2738
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
and then just about to

2739
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
or a MERSH

2740
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
MERSH by itself

2741
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Just the right amount of base is the best

2742
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
too little too much

2743
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
So we often say that you should follow the doctor's instructions to take medicine

2744
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
in this way

2745
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Because of its high concentration of course

2746
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
It may act on other molecules

2747
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
If there is too little, it may not be enough.

2748
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
So this is a

2749
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
yes

2750
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
So this result is actually grandson, you ask me

2751
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Don't take it by yourself when you go home

2752
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
too much can be problematic

2753
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Okay, the last one will ask you later

2754
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Excuse me, professor, you just said

2755
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
When you use Pegasus

2756
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
It is the use of scientifically concentrated traditional Chinese medicine

2757
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
extraction

2758
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
yes

2759
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
we all try

2760
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Concentrated

2761
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
then additionally

2762
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
This experiment proved that concentrated

2763
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
We have put the principal components inside

2764
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
called Gasodin

2765
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
tried

2766
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
that works too

2767
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
But not as good as this

2768
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
so it looks like

2769
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
It's actually several ingredients together

2770
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
It might work best like this

2771
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
ask one more

2772
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Just happened to be right

2773
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
just now your slime shows

2774
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
There are more sketches about the autism

2775
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Sutu

2776
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Then Lomo's normal down

2777
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Then the other one is called

2778
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
mental disorder

2779
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I'm just wondering if autistic people are less likely to get treatment from Bakis

2780
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Relatively speaking

2781
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
this is a good question

2782
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I'm guessing

2783
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
I never thought about this

2784
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:16,000
That fear is like this in this life

2785
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
For example, for some diseases, sometimes some investigations will find that this is indeed the case

2786
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Even before, there was a person who taught the most general way of speaking

2787
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
That means people with cancer don't get that

2788
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Neural push

2789
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
You won't get cancer if you get nervous

2790
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Then they came up with a theory

2791
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
this one with protein

2792
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
folding is related

2793
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Protein folding is related to

2794
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Even if this life has something to do with Alzheimer's disease

2795
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Protect

2796
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
There are some things that are actually being investigated now

2797
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Some factors have had an impact on him.

2798
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
full of effect

2799
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
some effect

2800
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
The greatest effect on the two diseases

2801
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
is age

2802
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
The best age to talk about now

2803
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
The older you get, the higher your memory of getting sick

2804
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
The second most effective thing is exercise

2805
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Most sports have a great effect on this

2806
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
There are some reasons that I can't tell

2807
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
For example, drinking coffee is actually right

2808
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Mr Pan has some effect

2809
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
But the effect is very small, so don't write it down

2810
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Go back and drink more?

2811
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
can't sleep at night

2812
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Then there is another one that everyone is afraid to say

2813
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
is smoking

2814
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Once you talk about it, it will be troublesome

2815
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
People who smoke say I have a reason to smoke

2816
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Well, if you actually smoke, that's right.

2817
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Alzheimer's and Mr. Pan have a little protective effect

2818
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
This is also your game to read literature

2819
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
But everyone is afraid to speak, sorry to speak

2820
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I'm talking secretly now, please don't say that

2821
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
please don't promote

2822
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
But in fact there are reporters

2823
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Let me add that this type of research is all about correlation

2824
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
who you statistically smoke

2825
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
What are the odds of getting this?

2826
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
It's not about smoking

2827
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
will affect this matter

2828
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
OK, are we still there?

2829
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
friends have problems

2830
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
please

2831
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,000
That is, there are three nerves on the edge of the four nerves

2832
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
just mentioned three

2833
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
one is that shape

2834
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
on the edge

2835
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
one is color

2836
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Then another judgment is his dynamic

2837
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
that such a

2838
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Is it because his body's four nerves have different divisions of labor?

2839
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Are there any that are more sensitive to color?

2840
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Is there any division of labor in these nerve borders?

2841
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Or is it that the entire nerve border of our tetraretina is

2842
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Same work and same hatred

2843
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
and then add different dimensions

2844
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
you asked a good question

2845
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I'm not an expert there

2846
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
But I can give you some simple answers

2847
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,000
The first one is called parallel processing

2848
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
is processed together

2849
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
They do divide labor

2850
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
look at the color

2851
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:56,000
The color is also divided into red green blue

2852
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
three colors

2853
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
red is only for humans

2854
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
You go to some monkeys or to the general east house that red is gone

2855
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
So we humans can see roses

2856
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
beautiful roses

2857
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
That

2858
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
then that

2859
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
are different four nerves far in

2860
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
look at different things

2861
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
then put together

2862
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
So our eyes are actually very powerful

2863
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Sorry to add a related

2864
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
because i teach art

2865
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Then it seems that boys are less sensitive to social feelings

2866
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
right

2867
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
then to that

2868
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
in shape

2869
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
they have a good grasp

2870
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
is a boy

2871
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
you go to the department store

2872
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Boys, look what you all wear

2873
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
It's those colors

2874
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:42,000
keep it simple

2875
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Then they say women are more like children

2876
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
That color is very colorful

2877
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
And there will be a very detailed analysis

2878
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
It's also a human

2879
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
A division of labor for the development of an entire culture

2880
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
some are

2881
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Demon offers nerves to destroy it

2882
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:59,000
just don't be too sensitive

2883
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,600
I can say this, it's not good for boys, it's not good for girls

2884
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:11,400
We have a gene that recognizes red, it seems to be X

2885
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:15,600
If you know X, there is only one for boys and two for girls

2886
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:20,800
This boy is prone to mutations, so boys have a lot of color

2887
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:25,400
Some people are more sensitive to color, in fact, the photoreceptor cells

2888
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:28,000
That is to say, apart from recognizing red, he may have a little difference in length

2889
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
He may have different neurons to detect him

2890
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:37,000
So some people are really sensitive to those who study art or clothes design like you

2891
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
like us , like me is very insensitive

2892
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I probably only do experiments to see red, green and blue mixed together like this

2893
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Then there is indeed a natural difference

2894
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
As I mentioned just now, there are also animals, some of which cannot see red

2895
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
ok , we are running out of time , our last question

2896
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I can add to the lady's question just now

2897
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
She didn't mean that we were...

2898
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,440
Our nerve cells have a division of labor on the image

2899
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,440
My answer is to try

2900
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:08,160
Then its division of labor

2901
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:13,200
The color is that there is a kind of sight-seeking cells on our social membrane.

2902
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,600
It can identify RGB three colors

2903
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:19,520
There should be this related connection in fine arts

2904
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,680
So we can identify RGB

2905
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:23,520
Then use its brightness's

2906
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:27,360
It is to disassemble it to show our various colors

2907
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:33,280
Then in terms of pure brightness

2908
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,600
There is another type called sight-seeking cells

2909
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:40,960
it can be compared for brightness

2910
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,640
And finally the part of that shape

2911
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:49,040
Mainly when some visual areas of the brain are doing calculations

2912
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,200
it will have specific different cells

2913
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:55,200
is to analyze its shape or the direction it moves

2914
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,720
then activates a specific population of cells in the visual area

2915
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:00,000
Do more advanced processing

2916
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Thanks

2917
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
ok thank you very well said

2918
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
ok then i think our time is up

2919
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Thank you for your enthusiastic participation today

2920
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Hope we can come again in December

2921
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Thanks
