17
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Thank you for your cooperation

18
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Academia Sinica's 112-year-old governor Cai Yuanpei's popular science award begins

19
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We ask Vice President Zhou Meiyin to host for us

20
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ask Vice President Zhou Meiyin to host for us

21
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Ask Vice President Zhou Meiyin to host for us

22
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ask Vice President Zhou Meiyin to host for us

23
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Dear teachers Ma, distinguished guests and colleagues, good night everyone

24
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
In order to commemorate the 155th birthday of President Cai Yuanpei Gu

25
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So we are holding today this is the 2023 Governor's Vision

26
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Dean Cai Yuanpei's Science Popularization Award

27
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So we are very happy and honored to invite you to the Institute of Earth Sciences

28
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Ma Guofeng Distinguished Researcher of the Institute of Earth Sciences

29
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,400
come and give us a lecture

30
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,240
see this generation of light that initiates earthquakes

31
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,840
When the light first penetrates into the monitoring of the fault zone

32
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,440
this could be very interesting

33
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,040
Then we know that Mr. Ma graduated from

34
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,880
Department of Geophysics, Chuo University

35
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,960
Then at the Institute of Oceanography at National Taiwan University

36
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,560
Study abroad after earning a master's degree

37
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,920
Finally at Caltech

38
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,480
The Department of Geology and Planetary Sciences

39
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,040
very special one

40
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,600
received a Ph.D.

41
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,480
Return to Taiwan to serve after graduation

42
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Then enter Central University to teach

43
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
until 2020

44
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,400
Transfer to this institute as a special research institute of the Earth Institute

45
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He is also currently the Chief Scientist of the Taiwan Earthquake Science Center

46
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's also the director of the Earthquake Disaster Chain Risk Assessment and Management Research Center at Chuo University

47
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mr. Nama's main major is in seismology and political mechanics

48
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So wait a minute to hear him explain this to us

49
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,000
These studies are able to observe earthquakes that are very relevant to us

50
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
His greatest contribution was the first observation of the thickness of the Chinese belt of a large earthquake fault

51
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then, quantitative calculations can be used to obtain the energy for generating earthquakes

52
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
then what energy

53
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
military research on earthquakes, etc.

54
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,480
We'll hear some research on this later

55
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,560
What about the research on earthquake disaster risk assessment?

56
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
We can take the results of academic research

57
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,520
applied to related industries

58
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,400
To reduce the damage caused by earthquakes

59
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,600
So this is our Academia Sinica doing basic research

60
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,320
But it is closely related to the current situation of Paiwai.

61
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,640
Teacher Nama Guofeng has received many academic honors

62
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,440
as early as 2000

63
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,400
Elected as one of the top ten outstanding young women of the Republic of China

64
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,240
In 2011, he won the Taiwan Outstanding Scientist Award

65
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,840
Received the 17th National Award from the Ministry of Education in 2013

66
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,800
Measure right as long as it doesn't matter

67
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,720
and many other awards

68
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,800
2019 was elected to the American Geophysical Union

69
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,720
2021 is the Year of the Earth Science Society of Asia and Oceania

70
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,640
These awards of an X-Ware Medal Award

71
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,040
So now we're talking about today's lecture

72
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I will introduce this to you in particular

73
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,000
Our so-called vibration research on seismic waves observed by Mitsusen

74
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,440
can help us

75
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,600
The observation of this earthquake

76
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,600
And then going deep into this fault zone can provide high-resolution seismic signals

77
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,800
This is very important to our understanding of earthquakes

78
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Okay, now please give us a big round of applause

79
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,120
Welcome Ma Guofeng Distinguished Researcher

80
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,920
Give us a special lecture today

81
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,120
Thank you Vice President for your introduction

82
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,200
Also, thank you, my friends, for your special attention.

83
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Thanks

84
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,040
I am very happy to have this opportunity today

85
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Personally, I think it is in our seismological science supernatural

86
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
very important for a new generation

87
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Then I think each science is about 20 to 30 years

88
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There will be a new conversion into

89
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
then i'm glad to have this opportunity

90
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
when i was a doctor

91
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Seismology from flat to broadband

92
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How about when you are more senior?

93
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Having access to this highest resolution material again

94
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Analysis with the current big data data

95
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Earthquake Science Content

96
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
then i'm happy too

97
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
My idea has achieved a key breakthrough in the hospital

98
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
support for this project

99
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Only way to get this job today

100
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, this is actually a new attempt

101
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Then I would like to take this opportunity to introduce to you

102
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We now have the development of a new generation of earthquake science

103
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and why do we need this thing

104
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Of course, there are still many challenges in it.

105
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but i think it's the future

106
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,440
Towards that job, of course I am the main leader

107
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,280
But it takes a lot of teams to actually execute

108
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,680
Because it actually has a lot of technology in it

109
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,840
Not just data analysis Data analysis is

110
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,480
Now let's enjoy data analysis

111
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,720
But in the first two years it was actually a lot of labor work

112
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,720
researchers of technologies that matter to our planet

113
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,640
they are very important roles

114
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,160
Dr. Lin Qingren Dr. Gu Jinshang

115
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,080
And researcher Huang Xinhua

116
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,480
This is a very elite key figure in the whole team

117
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,040
Then it's me and Germany

118
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,000
Especially Sabastian and Philip

119
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,560
their instruments in europe

120
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,440
They first lent us the equipment

121
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,320
Let's understand what characterizes the whole instrument

122
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,400
So I am very happy to tell you today

123
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,720
Launch the Seismic Light Generation

124
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,760
Then I believe that those who are doing

125
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,120
It should be a little bit about earthquakes

126
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,880
So what I'm talking about may be more popular than general science.

127
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,720
slightly higher

128
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
a little deeper

129
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
but i think

130
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is a knowledge experiment at the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine

131
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and the audience may be more able to

132
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
what you want to contact

133
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So I will talk a little bit

134
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
General science is a little deeper

135
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, of course earthquake observation I just mentioned

136
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I am honored to be in

137
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
When I graduated from my Ph.D.

138
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The result is that the entire earthquake becomes broadband

139
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The observation is that I go from 1Hz to

140
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
1Hz should mean from 0.01 seconds

141
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I can write it all down to 100Hz

142
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So this is what we call a broadband seismic network.

143
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
In fact, in the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine

144
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Dr. Liang Wenzhong We started to promote

145
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
的 Broadband Array in Seismology

146
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This is BATS

147
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
At that time, I was in the Earth Institute of the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

148
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He has been in seismology in Taiwan

149
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
play a very important role

150
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That is, whenever an earthquake occurs

151
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Whether it's the shock of all the boots

152
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
or any earthquake in the world

153
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
happened we can all remember

154
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, of course it has something to do with the work of the weather bureau.

155
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Of course it's very close

156
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
From the Odds Bureau, it is of course more biased towards large-scale earthquakes

157
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,400
Scale 4 Scale 5 It's gonna start doing some of these enouncements of earthquakes

158
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,940
Its location may not be as precise as ours

159
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,340
But it needs to be within the fastest time

160
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,880
Tell everyone where the earthquake is and how big it is

161
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,480
But with the role of BETS of the Central Plains Earth Institute

162
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,080
It's just that I am very accurate for small earthquakes.

163
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,980
Then my scale also has a certain scale relationship

164
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,180
Only then can I have a series of high-quality data for earthquake research

165
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,180
Then this high-quality data is not just a study of Taiwan

166
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,820
is the world's earthquake science

167
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,660
Of course I think it's the same in every field of science.

168
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,220
That is, earthquake science is a very international research science.

169
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,220
Because of the large-scale earthquake, the so-called large-scale is scale 7 scale 8

170
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,660
Of course we don't want it to happen often

171
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,260
but as soon as it happened

172
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,800
The world wants to be able to share this material and understand its uniqueness

173
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,440
In particular, seismology is a very science of earthquake observation

174
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,400
It must have earthquake observation and disaster status

175
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,200
The more refined we are

176
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
theories of our science

177
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Then make the basis of disaster prevention

178
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So here at the Zhongyingyuan

179
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
In fact, it has always played a very important role

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This is from Teacher Liang Wenzhong

181
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We are on the official website of the Earth Institute of the Zhongying Institute

182
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Show it directly and GPS ground deformation

183
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That is, except for the situation that happened during the earthquake

184
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I still need to know

185
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Entire plate collides with Taiwan

186
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
how is it

187
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
how energy is accumulated

188
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
how much it accumulated

189
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
how fast it accumulates

190
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
that of course is back to us

191
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It was later shown with the so-called seismic hazard

192
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
such a job

193
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Then this is actually for Backbone

194
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just one he must be stable

195
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and he can't disconnect

196
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And permanently maintain the highest quality signal

197
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Then this quality control

198
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course the most important thing

199
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that besides this

200
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Many developments in the past twenty or thirty years

201
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Although I just talked about the generation of light

202
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's not that we were twenty or thirty years ago

203
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
didn't do anything

204
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
but twenty or thirty years ago

205
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
we have started to develop

206
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the entire earthquake signal

207
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hope to prevent disasters from earthquakes

208
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,460
Just mentioned by the vice president

209
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,080
A very important role in our earthquake science is

210
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,620
give back to society

211
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,000
when an earthquake occurs

212
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,460
how the hell do we get

213
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,240
what is the fastest message

214
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,040
So this is a solemn admission

215
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,940
the same is within us

216
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,360
Dr. Li Xianzhong received

217
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,680
is our signal

218
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,600
the signal just said

219
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
In fact I am every second

220
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,900
Actually every 0.01 seconds

221
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,280
The signal keeps coming in

222
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,200
So let's build

223
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,560
Database of Seismic Waves of All Taiwan

224
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,920
Then as long as the earthquake comes every two seconds

225
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,520
In fact, whether there is an earthquake or not

226
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,840
Every two seconds I react by myself

227
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,520
Going to explain my current vibration

228
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,560
Is it an earthquake

229
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,720
Therefore, we can quickly

230
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,040
two seconds or even ten seconds

231
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,120
we can book the earthquake

232
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,920
size

233
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,040
and its location

234
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,600
that this is now

235
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,160
There are many collaborations with the weather track list

236
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,720
or everyone here

237
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
may work for us

238
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,960
some familiar words

239
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,400
That's when we have an earthquake every time

240
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,240
We will directly poss up

241
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,880
Many friends also directly

242
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,680
just look online

243
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,920
I see a lot of friends on Facebook

244
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So directly put this network

245
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
As far as the post is concerned, where is the earthquake?

246
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
For example, this is the Hualien earthquake on February 6, 2018

247
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
At this moment, of course we can put

248
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
size, depth

249
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Solve for its positive element mechanism

250
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
All solved and its maximum position

251
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's totally intelligent

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It is completely Online

253
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Then Real Time directly and automatically

254
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
do the program work

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then this is one of the very important contributions

256
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It is just mentioned in the past 10 years

257
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Taiwan Earthquake Science Center

258
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
important work done

259
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
outside of scientific research

260
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
How to really feedback the information of the whole Society

261
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, this is of course another important task.

262
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
is also in

263
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It will be seen in the official website of the Earth Institute

264
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
every time an earthquake occurs

265
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There will be more than 600 steps in Taiwan

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We get Real Time's Share Map anytime

267
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the vibration chart

268
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
In fact, earthquake disaster prevention is very important

269
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
say it's a beauty earthquake

270
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,700
Maybe everyone is in the middle of the night and it's New Year's Eve

271
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,900
so no one knows what's going on

272
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,100
But if you come directly to this page

273
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,700
You can see that I am in Kaohsiung Tainan

274
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,500
Vibrations with a magnitude of 7 or higher are generated near here

275
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,100
That's because our earthquake blood is researching

276
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,700
We know this is bound to produce disaster

277
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,300
At the beginning, it was also NCDR who directly contacted and said

278
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,500
kink

279
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,700
it will surely produce disaster

280
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,300
Then make direct contact with other units of the fire department

281
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Then this part is also the shake map of real time every five seconds

282
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,300
That's because our Central Plains Institute is currently

283
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,200
There are many things that need to be strengthened in terms of law and order

284
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,300
So we are currently offline

285
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,700
Because of the maintenance of the security firewall

286
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,600
That's another challenge

287
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,200
That is, I want to open data

288
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,200
But I also need a very good firewall

289
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,300
it's a bit of a dilemma

290
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,400
but we want to find the balance

291
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,300
Then this is all open to all people can use

292
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
of course i now

293
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,600
I know Teacher Liang just met him

294
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,400
Said he would come too

295
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,100
we now hope

296
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I can play this real time intensity directly to

297
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
above the person's position

298
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If you put it in the corner where you are

299
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's what we want to develop now

300
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
work related to communication

301
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Then this is actually

302
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What we have done over the years

303
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Of course, these jobs have already played a certain role.

304
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Especially since everyone has become familiar with

305
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
what early warning message

306
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
some people will mention

307
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
is he borderline

308
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
why didn't he receive

309
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
why did he receive blah blah blah

310
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Of course if you want to be accurate

311
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It must be very high resolution

312
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Because everyone has heard that I am in Shichenglou

313
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You said the vibration level is 2

314
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't, I'm shaking too much

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
OK because Shicheng Tower has different

316
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
different shake sizes

317
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
There is someone in the Taipei Basin who has been shaking for a long time

318
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Some people shake it better on the side of the mountain

319
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
not so long

320
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But with the current earthquake stations in Taiwan

321
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Probably more than 10 kilometers as a resolution

322
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Well, that's still important in this part.

323
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
We must say that this most basic backbone

324
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,800
is to keep all signals stable

325
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,700
important key observation network

326
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,800
then it can instantly locate the scale mechanism

327
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,900
That probably means we have meteorological laws when we go to Taiwan.

328
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,600
basically we can't announce the location of the earthquake

329
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
We want the weather bureau to announce

330
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,700
then what we do is meteorology

331
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,300
But we are after this real time Maping

332
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,500
There is some interaction with the Meteorological Bureau

333
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,700
So but sometimes you'll see that the scale is a little bit different

334
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,800
the location is a bit different

335
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,100
That is we probably every earthquake is like last time

336
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Ikegami Earthquake

337
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,200
September's Ikegami Earthquake

338
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,900
a week later

339
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,900
We'll have a joint seminar with the Bureau of Meteorology

340
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,800
Discuss all communication and

341
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Understanding and analyzing data, etc.

342
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,400
Well, that's actually going to really see some

343
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
More precise slices

344
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,800
For example, the structure of the Taipei Flat just mentioned

345
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,000
you are next to the fault

346
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,260
on the hanging wall of the fault you are on the foot wall of the fault

347
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,420
etc

348
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,340
You need a lot of more detailed data analysis

349
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,420
that in the past few years

350
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,800
In fact, it is just a Geofone Array

351
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,820
That is, you will, we will go out into the field to set up a few side stations

352
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,620
Which station may be how to go is about a kilometer away

353
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,420
but you need it to have battery impact

354
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,020
It may be operable for about a month, three months

355
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,700
but you will do it with your needs

356
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,460
Well, this actually did a lot

357
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,520
Especially now that there was a geothermal seminar yesterday

358
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,320
You mentioned a lot of this kind of Geofone

359
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,520
To probe the entire structure in high resolution

360
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,520
OK, but while this high-resolution detection

361
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,180
There's something new, and it's called fiber optics.

362
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,740
In fact, everyone is using this optical fiber now.

363
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,440
It is Chunghwa Telecom, you will see 5G optical fiber

364
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,840
you have a cable

365
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,720
The current practice is to say

366
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,320
how do i bury us in the ground

367
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,320
Chunghwa Telecom these cables

368
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It becomes the observation of the earthquake chair

369
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Then its main job is to say

370
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm next to all the fibers

371
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Adding a DARS here is a

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
that is

373
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Distributed Acoustic Sensing

374
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
it actually shoots a laser beam out

375
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Then if you talk about disturbance

376
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
When the laser beam returns

377
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
you will have a phase change

378
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Phase change from

379
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I can figure it out and say

380
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
How much does it disturb

381
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
how much disturbance

382
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Of course I can decide

383
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Where did this disturbance come from?

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
the fiber optic

385
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Monitoring Of course it's not just

386
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
do earthquake

387
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
car waves weather water

388
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
all can

389
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Well, I'm just more focused today.

390
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
to mention its relationship to earthquakes

391
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's my current job

392
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
already like i last week

393
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Three months in Caltic in the United States

394
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
work i know has done froding

395
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It's now

396
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
America is now flooding

397
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
flooded quite seriously

398
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's about this aspect of Froding

399
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
natural test is

400
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,280
is allowed

401
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,480
of course this part

402
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,680
We still have many challenges

403
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
I'm buried in the ground

404
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,080
Then all disturbances will be sent

405
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,080
So how do I tell if it's a signal

406
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,320
still an earthquake

407
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,160
That requires a lot of data analysis of big data

408
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,720
so i will say

409
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,920
I am honored that in my senior years

410
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,600
Senior this experience when

411
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
to another generation

412
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,000
Of course, this is even more interdisciplinary.

413
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
it's not earthquake blood

414
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,720
It also includes the training of the AI

415
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,920
Training materials for Machine Learning

416
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
Because its data is a few terabytes a day

417
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,480
how about the whole data

418
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,960
make it fast and accurate

419
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,200
that's another challenge

420
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
that job of course

421
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,000
Just mentioned I've been thinking about saying

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Is it possible to do this

423
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,320
Advancing our earthquake science

424
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,280
to what extent

425
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,120
Actually, I've been thinking about it

426
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,080
That is, I can increase the resolution to a higher

427
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
So how can I parse

428
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,440
Problems in Earthquake Physics

429
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,960
to what extent

430
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
this is my thinking

431
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,120
But in terms of structure, it is absolutely possible to have higher-resolution structural analysis

432
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,520
Can it improve the accuracy of our earthquake early warning?

433
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,300
Accuracy of Earthquakes

434
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,100
For example, if you have a shock level of 2 and a shock level of 3

435
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,800
Can I get the correct data more accurately?

436
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,080
That's not to mention looking at energy

437
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,320
Because I just saw colleagues from Taipower come over

438
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,440
or some of the other ex-friends

439
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,400
Now we are talking about carbon dioxide storage in Taiwan

440
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Green energy and so on

441
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,760
So if I pump carbon dioxide into the ground today

442
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
how carbon dioxide travels

443
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,360
We can also map it out

444
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,960
because I can put all the signals

445
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,960
All perturbations down to a few micro and even down to a Nano

446
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,320
can detect it

447
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,200
Everyone, see where my Fiber is placed

448
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,760
That's now geothermal carbon sequestration

449
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,960
Or if you have questions about geothermal energy

450
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
geothermal exploration

451
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
For example in Finland

452
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,360
Or another earthquake in the Netherlands because of geothermal carbon deposits

453
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,640
So shut down the whole factory

454
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,320
Is there a way for us to come up with some solutions for this part?

455
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,080
So it can be applied in a wide range of

456
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,040
Then I just talk about it today as the beginning of an era of light

457
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,800
I must say the whole thing I'm going to share today

458
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,240
In fact, the future may be even more exciting

459
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,840
Today is just a bit of a kick off feeling

460
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,400
Well, the application of this is of course

461
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,160
why so accurate

462
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,040
we generally speaking

463
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,840
Of course when the earthquake comes

464
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
you want to shake

465
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,280
know how much i shake

466
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,440
But our real challenge is to say

467
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,480
the beginning of the earthquake

468
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,280
when the first person starts shaking

469
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,640
Do you know if it will be a scale seven or a scale eight

470
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,920
or do you think it's only scale five

471
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,680
Yes, we are usually when the earthquake hits

472
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
whether you were warned

473
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,240
You must feel it first

474
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,640
How big is my earthquake?

475
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,880
when you really get nervous

476
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,760
it just stopped

477
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,200
but can we do it

478
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Do we have scientifically

479
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,500
This ability even physically understands

480
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,440
Is there a way to know the beginning of an earthquake?

481
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,640
How big will it become? Is it possible?

482
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,440
Well, of course, this raises a lot of scientific issues.

483
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,300
But in general industry

484
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,840
The industry began to make a lot of contact with us

485
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,240
He will tell me, Mr. Mao, I am not doing earthquake prediction.

486
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,440
but can you tell me how long this earthquake will shake

487
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,640
Or can I make my machine

488
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,740
Such as the semiconductor process

489
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,480
I know when my machine shakes to 20G

490
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,180
it may contaminate can i let it be mentioned

491
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,280
It takes 3 seconds when I mention it takes 2 seconds

492
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,080
can i do it

493
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,080
So with this kind of dialogue, I actually feel that

494
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,240
very important conversation let me think

495
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,580
what can i do

496
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,480
Then this part of the information becomes very important

497
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,480
For example, when this signal comes in

498
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,980
when this signal comes in

499
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,140
I just mentioned my little signal from the beginning

500
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,280
you haven't you probably haven't felt yet

501
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,080
But suppose I

502
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,720
has a very sharp fiber optic

503
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,000
even very close side stand

504
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,120
I can tell it's already a signal

505
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,920
Then I know that from this signal

506
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,360
can know this signal

507
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,720
It arrives at the maximum acceleration value

508
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,880
Does it have a certain regression relationship?

509
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,320
How many seconds will it take me to be sure?

510
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,280
Will this earthquake cause disaster?

511
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,080
I may have no way of knowing where the earthquake is right away

512
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,680
Because earthquake location takes time

513
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,520
You have to have at least three stations to receive

514
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,880
that's earthquake scale

515
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,160
You may not be so accurate right away.

516
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,640
But I know when I shake to a certain degree

517
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,040
For example, our human feelings

518
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,520
I think everyone in Taiwan must have felt an earthquake

519
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,920
When you shake for more than 10 seconds

520
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,160
you will start to get nervous

521
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,800
Do you think that this earthquake will

522
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,480
I should protect myself

523
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,920
Is there even a disaster

524
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,720
Then our seismology

525
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,760
about 3 seconds

526
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,400
That is what we tell us from our empirical data

527
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,080
3 seconds before the earthquake signal comes in

528
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It can tell us it's about to turn into a catastrophic earthquake

529
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
or not a catastrophic earthquake

530
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That is to say, after it comes up in 3 seconds,

531
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
it may go down

532
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
After 3 seconds it keeps going

533
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
If you continue walking after 3 seconds

534
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
it can produce disaster

535
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Although I don't know if it's scale 7 or scale 8

536
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
but it will have disasters

537
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So I gave a warning

538
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
These are some related concepts of earthquake early warning

539
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Of course, in terms of decision-making

540
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's whether I can be in that moment

541
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
just make a decision

542
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Of course, this decision must be an intelligent one.

543
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So this is a high-resolution signal

544
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
its important precision

545
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
That's why I was referring to the fiber optic

546
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Can we make this more precise

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Because we don't want to have Force Alarm either

548
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
In general industry

549
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Force Alarm it also loses a lot

550
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
so they have to say

551
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I need to know my Early Warning

552
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But I'm not a Force Alarm

553
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Otherwise, my Impact would be huge

554
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So that's the whole challenge in this place

555
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Of course, this is an industrial application

556
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
It's about earthquake science.

557
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,160
Great connection with the social body of the whole society

558
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,580
Of course it also mentioned Taiwan

559
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,140
I think the news is familiar

560
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,940
Taiwan's semiconductor

561
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,140
is important to us

562
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,520
very important economic value

563
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Then Taiwan is a place with multiple arrays

564
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,180
then many people will want to say

565
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,820
Then I may have a lot of losses

566
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,720
Then I also thought

567
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,020
This is the situation facing Taiwan

568
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,520
So what angle does our science use?

569
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,920
can be impacted in this area when

570
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,420
keep us

571
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,520
won't be affected too much

572
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,120
At the same time, it has also become a business opportunity for us

573
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,320
It is now that the whole world is developing

574
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,360
In 2010, of course, Japan is doing a lot

575
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,400
California is doing it too

576
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,360
Italy and other countries are doing

577
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,500
But we have the most earthquake signals

578
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,000
that's because you want to train

579
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,840
You need a lot of data

580
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Then Taiwan is a large amount of information

581
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,180
important database

582
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,340
That's another

583
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,100
If the earthquake is far away from me

584
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That Early Warning is useless

585
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That is to say, five or six years ago

586
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But mainland China is developing a lot Early Warning

587
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Then the news mentioned that

588
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Earthquake warnings in Taiwan are poor

589
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Only three seconds, five seconds

590
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Look at the earthquake in Sichuan in Japan

591
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It can warn earthquakes for 20 to 30 seconds

592
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
In fact, there is a concept to know

593
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Twenty seconds, thirty seconds means the earthquake is very, very far away from you

594
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Giving you an Early Warning is actually useless

595
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Because I can't say it's useless

596
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It should mean that it does not actually cause disasters

597
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
so sometimes we talk

598
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Early Warning sometimes becomes Entertainment

599
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That's the earthquake warning

600
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Huh? Did you get it?

601
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Huh? Why didn't I get it? Why didn't you get it?

602
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
In fact the whole real purpose is to reduce the shock

603
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But sometimes there's this aspect

604
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
become everyone comparing me

605
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
under what conditions

606
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Of course, this is something we have discussed a lot with the Qiathlon Bureau and the NCD.

607
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That is, we must all test

608
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Everyone can receive this message accurately

609
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Okay back to the science question

610
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
There are many important scientific challenges

611
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
that is

612
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,500
i hope what we do

613
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,800
except for the folk

614
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Beyond contributions that are important to our country

615
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,500
Taiwan's role in earthquake science

616
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,500
What kind of leadership can there be in the world

617
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,500
scientific value

618
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
that just mentioned

619
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,000
Everyone is most concerned about earthquake prediction

620
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,700
as long as i say i am a seismologist

621
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,000
Including customs clearance to the United States

622
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,500
As long as I say I'm a Sesemologist

623
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
He immediately asked me if I could do earthquake prediction

624
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,000
Earthquake prediction is a matter of concern to everyone.

625
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,700
Is it possible that he

626
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
I just mentioned the earthquake

627
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,200
he was at the beginning

628
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Do you know how big he has become?

629
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
How exactly did the earthquake start?

630
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,700
how did he end

631
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,200
In fact, there is still no answer

632
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
then i keep saying

633
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
If you don't know how an earthquake starts

634
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,700
don't know how he ended

635
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
You can't do earthquake prediction at all

636
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
Earthquake predictions just stay in statistics

637
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
statistics it has a certain value

638
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,200
the industry I just mentioned

639
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
they want to know

640
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
earthquake forecasting

641
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,960
how is the estimate

642
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,300
Then we have a certain theory

643
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,040
can do this work

644
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,200
But earthquake prediction works

645
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,880
He still has many challenges

646
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,880
I even often say

647
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,480
If the earthquake prediction is successful

648
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,080
Earthquakes will still come

649
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,240
Not that you predict earthquakes

650
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,920
Earthquakes don't come, right?

651
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,880
so you really do work

652
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,440
In fact, earthquake disaster prevention

653
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,780
and earthquake warning

654
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,260
even

655
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,820
If Earthquake Prediction Fails

656
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,160
the disaster he caused

657
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,120
Possibly worse than a real earthquake disaster

658
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,620
Right, you can think about it

659
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,260
If I talk about a

660
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,960
Taiwan may be within a week

661
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,160
A scale period of earthquakes

662
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,860
Stocks may plummet

663
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,800
everyone wants to go abroad

664
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,240
or where are you going

665
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,940
last time there was a tsunami

666
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,540
The first tsunami alarm

667
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,480
As a result, there was a traffic jam on the highway.

668
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,840
that this is actually

669
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,740
When we're working on this

670
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,740
how are we getting ready

671
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,900
Then I often used to talk to students

672
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,600
my dream but my dream i don't think i can make it

673
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,200
That's me, if the earthquake prediction is successful

674
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,900
Then make it a hundred times the energy into a real energy that can be used

675
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,040
I think earthquake prediction is feasible

676
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,600
or worth doing

677
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,200
Otherwise the work we do

678
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,000
Earthquake early warning and earthquake disaster prevention

679
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,200
How do we proceed with earthquake early warning and earthquake disaster prevention?

680
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,400
For example, how do I put Taiwan but the whole world is the same

681
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
The location of these fault zones that may produce earthquakes in Taiwan

682
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
not very clear

683
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
This is what we do with geologists

684
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,500
However, the Geological Survey Institute, the Meteorological Bureau, and many related units

685
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,600
how do i know where the fault is

686
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,400
When will this fault move?

687
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,800
how much does it move

688
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,600
If it moves, what about the mayor of Taipei?

689
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,200
what will happen

690
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,200
what will happen to my family

691
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,700
the location of a place how it will be

692
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,200
That's what we're talking about now

693
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
National Disaster Prevention Science and Technology Center

694
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,700
Or something that the Ministry of the Interior Interdepartmental Council is doing

695
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,920
It is a drill for a large-scale earthquake every September

696
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,620
But this part is not precise enough

697
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,820
That's how I know about earthquake fault systems

698
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,460
For example, the Chishang earthquake on September 18

699
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,660
It moves both faults

700
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,060
Central Sanpai fault to the west

701
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,360
Chishang Fault to the east

702
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,460
both moved

703
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,400
The 1906 Meishan Earthquake

704
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,560
It actually you see an east-west Meishan fault

705
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,960
But in fact its real motion structure

706
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,560
is the movement structure underneath

707
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,860
Then the reverse fault becomes a strike fault

708
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,760
Is there a way for us to do these things first?

709
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,320
understand its shape

710
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,560
even academically

711
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,860
If my fault jumps to another fault

712
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,860
Or the 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung Earthquake

713
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,320
It is an earthquake with a greater disaster than 921

714
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,560
It is actually three faults

715
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,420
From reverse faults to dead faults to strike faults

716
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,120
How are these mechanisms formed?

717
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,320
so real earthquake science

718
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,660
I don't think it's just about earthquake prediction

719
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,820
real science is understanding

720
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,820
How did the fault break

721
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is there a way for me to know the shape of the fault in advance?

722
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
how to count

723
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And what happens to him when he moves?

724
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We are now finding more and more into fault vibrations

725
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You fault away from your location

726
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
when you fault

727
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
a very long period signal

728
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The stunned shout he produced will be introduced later

729
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
then again

730
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
How do I know which fault he's moving when

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Can I simulate it first?

732
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
that this morning

733
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm actually at noon today

734
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
National Disaster Prevention Science Center

735
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
we are talking

736
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
What we now call digital chaos

737
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Digital Twin

738
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
How do I take my Synaryl

739
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
become a VR

740
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Then I can have a solution

741
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
is coming in

742
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
that part too

743
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
digital transformation

744
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Or in the current big data data

745
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
work that can be contributed

746
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Then accurately predict the earthquake

747
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That certainly doesn't sound like it has anything to do with the light.

748
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the fact that light i mentioned

749
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it actually increases the resolution

750
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
let me all countries on this side

751
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Make a more accurate observation component

752
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Okay, so if the answer to an earthquake is a more scientific question

753
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That's how the earthquake started

754
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
How do I know the earthquake from the first 0.01 seconds

755
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
When it starts to bite, how big is it?

756
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Earthquake it's a random act

757
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
or is it a self-similarity act

758
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
so some people will want to say

759
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Why should I have an earthquake on a scale 2

760
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm even on a scale -1 earthquake

761
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Because I want to know how the earthquake started

762
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
How did that moment come out?

763
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
There are probably a lot of different theories on this part.

764
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to explore, for example, that it has self-similarity

765
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
or cascadia

766
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It actually doesn't know if it will do it

767
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It changes as it encounters

768
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
What if this is the case?

769
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's hard to predict earthquakes

770
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Which means my earthquake is actually a random act

771
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Of course it's not random

772
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It should mean that I did not judge the shape of the entire fault zone

773
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I don't know its strain value

774
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,400
Strength and fault give me resistance

775
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
who is bigger

776
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,700
I can decide whether I want to move forward and continue to break

777
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,800
still have to stop

778
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,200
The other way is to say

779
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
I Earthquake In fact there is one

780
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,900
preparatory behavior

781
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,200
I am in one place first

782
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,500
After accumulating energy

783
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,100
then start breaking out

784
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,500
Well, this is of course a scientific challenge.

785
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,700
The role of the science challenge

786
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,800
Of course, the previous data were all on the surface.

787
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,800
or that its data is limited

788
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,100
Farther away from the location of the real small earthquake

789
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,100
So there is no way to get it very precisely.

790
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,200
Not only do I hope that the future's glamorous data

791
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,800
is there a way to work on this

792
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,100
come up with a higher resolution

793
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,100
For example, a few seconds before the beginning

794
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
this is one second

795
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,000
or one to six seconds

796
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,200
Earthquakes of different sizes from 6.7 to 8.7

797
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,200
You will find it difficult to judge at the beginning

798
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,500
That is to say, we may very well imagine that

799
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,600
It may be relatively slow for small-scale earthquakes

800
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
massive earthquake

801
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,040
In fact, it may be shaking

802
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,960
no

803
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,000
it actually

804
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,840
It might be shaking at first for a small earthquake

805
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,160
but it flattened out again

806
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,760
OK

807
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,200
so tell us

808
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,400
I want a few seconds from the beginning of the 0.0 signal

809
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,600
to assess how big the earthquake will be

810
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,040
it is challenging

811
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,840
but where is its real challenge

812
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,200
Because my stations are all above the surface

813
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
Above the surface my various noises

814
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,000
I have a submerged reflection signal

815
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,960
I have this shockwave zoom in on the grade layer

816
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,640
i have all kinds of pollution

817
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,200
That's why we keep referring to earthquakes

818
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,840
I always hope that the deeper the better

819
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,440
So you will go to the so-called special police

820
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,200
That's what I just mentioned

821
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,560
Although such challenges have been encountered in the past

822
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,360
but in theory

823
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,360
We know that when 3 seconds

824
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,400
My initial signal can tell me

825
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,760
If I surpass a government like this

826
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,040
can tell me about the earthquake

827
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,800
At least scale 6 and above

828
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,800
So I can start giving earthquake warnings

829
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,040
Below 6 we may

830
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
but limited to the west

831
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,600
the regulations say

832
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,440
Positive degree 5 or scale 6 or above

833
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,000
Early warning of earthquakes with a scale of 5.5 or more

834
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
ok that job

835
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,400
This work was published in 2005

836
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,440
In 2005, the data base behind the important

837
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,880
All earthquake data from Taiwan

838
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,000
This is Mr. Wu Yimin

839
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,360
the one just mentioned

840
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,600
Initial work on the entire orthographic map of PLR

841
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,920
In fact, the whole of Taiwan is used

842
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,320
The most dense data about nearly 20 years

843
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
Do the understanding of the whole signal

844
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,920
To understand the possibility of explaining this earthquake warning

845
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,120
Of course, it goes without saying that in the past ten years

846
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
Everyone has become more and more familiar

847
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,720
That concept was actually being talked about ten years ago

848
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,120
Of course this concept needs a lot

849
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,520
All signals in the latter part

850
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,720
Let all the resources in the latter stage be completed

851
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,320
Of course it's not

852
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
doused and wet

853
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,120
That is to say, when the earthquake warning was issued

854
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
some people have a concept

855
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
but very accurate

856
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,340
his concept he mentioned

857
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,840
Earthquake warnings are useless

858
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,580
Because you can give early warning somewhere

859
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,960
He's not that bad anymore

860
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,840
OK because your government has decayed

861
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,620
But he is not necessarily accurate

862
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,960
I must say, suppose there is an earthquake today

863
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,580
How many times did the 921 earthquake hit Taipei?

864
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,280
About 10 seconds 20 seconds warning time

865
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,620
But Taipei because of its shock wave amplification

866
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,580
So you have a moderate amount of forewarning.

867
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,780
But not to mention high-speed rail, MRT

868
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,000
These things are already

869
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,920
directly already in use

870
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,240
But this concept is not

871
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,420
his concept

872
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,420
It is generally challenging the concept of earthquake early warning

873
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,380
nothing wrong

874
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,500
That is to say, my real challenge is

875
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,500
I On site Erling Undead

876
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,680
How do I make my blind spot smaller and smaller

877
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,040
Which means I'll build an earthquake signal in.

878
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,800
I have to have three stations to receive

879
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,220
So, I passed it through three stations

880
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,840
You are at a depth of 10 kilometers

881
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,960
It's already going to cost three stations

882
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,200
two or three seconds

883
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,800
Not to mention I also need data processing

884
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,360
I want to go out again

885
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,960
you want the signal to come in

886
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,360
You throw it out after you get it

887
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,200
Then the whole time is delayed

888
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,000
So there is a big blind spot

889
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,480
That's about 30 kilometers, 50 kilometers

890
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,000
That is to say, if Jingyuan is right next to you

891
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,640
you have no chance of getting

892
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,200
time to get warning

893
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,720
Of course we are developing now

894
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,840
Unsee Aluminium Wondering 4

895
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,640
Earthquake 10 kilometers deep in the ground

896
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,200
You may still have 1 2 seconds

897
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,960
Effective

898
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,520
But this is not from the weather bureau

899
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,400
Regional Earthquake Early Warning

900
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,040
Bureau of Meteorology We are now receiving

901
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,000
Earthquake warnings issued by Meteorological Bureau are regional earthquake warnings

902
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,240
just after some distance

903
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,520
you will get an earthquake warning

904
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,720
but you are there

905
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,960
For example, the Ikegami earthquake

906
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,160
you are on the pool

907
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,320
You have no chance of getting an earthquake warning signal

908
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,560
because time is too late

909
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,000
Then our real challenge now is

910
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,760
How do I future is there a chance to use

911
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,000
this bright signal

912
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,920
I can make the blind spot smaller and smaller

913
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,600
I can't say with absolute certainty that it's perfectly fine

914
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,640
But because the challenge is great

915
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,160
like me this morning ourselves

916
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,200
Guru Meeting is doing Aluminum Wondering of AI

917
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,640
just mentioned

918
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,800
It seems that after the Chigami earthquake

919
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,360
nearby

920
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Those stations are all disconnected

921
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So even if my data processing site is good

922
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,300
Well done Fly

923
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,000
Actually the earthquake shook it and it disconnected

924
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So we can't do it

925
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So I just introduced to you

926
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Real-Time Moment Tensors made by Mr. Li Xiancong

927
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So we later have many versions that are

928
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Scale 6 scale 5 both work fine

929
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
because it's all online

930
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
A scale of 7 has several stations that may be

931
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Will Centralize or disconnect

932
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
So we mentioned at that time that I really wanted to challenge

933
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
An earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 in the Ryukyu Trench is in the open sea

934
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Then we're going to use the Japanese signal

935
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Signals used in the Philippines

936
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Signals used in Mainland China

937
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
to skip Taiwan

938
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Then how do we have an instant signal exchange

939
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Then this is also the Earth Institute of the Chinese Academy

940
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Cooperate with many international

941
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
That is, I have direct data exchange

942
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
can keep me on our island

943
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
In the case of a large-scale earthquake and power outages

944
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
i can still function

945
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
If you have the opportunity to compare yourself

946
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
will know

947
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,460
During the 921 earthquake, the COFCO radio station collapsed and nothing was left

948
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,600
I remember back then that I still had to talk over the phone

949
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,160
Let my Japanese friends tell me what happened

950
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:13,200
Then as long as there is power, grab the signal and start analyzing it.

951
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,600
Of course, the experience of 921 taught our country a lot

952
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,600
So we are now in the Ministry of Science and Technology

953
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,360
When the National Science and Technology Council does these tasks, it will mention that

954
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,200
How do I ensure critical infrastructure is not compromised

955
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,700
So the simulation of the large-scale earthquake we just talked about

956
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,000
I want to know where the Taipower tower is

957
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
gas it won't it leak because

958
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
It's just that if there is a leak, it will cause a fire.

959
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,300
Are our facilities complete in this part?

960
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,000
Here's what we're doing with massive earthquakes

961
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,600
Well, of course, this is very early work.

962
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,200
But I think it's worth watching directly with you

963
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,600
For example, during the 921 earthquake

964
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,200
You can see that the earthquake took ten or twenty seconds

965
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,000
Seismic waves began to spread to Taichung

966
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The government here in Fengyuan is very big

967
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,500
it breaks from south to north

968
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,000
So there is a relatively large government in the north

969
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
You will see that Taipei currently has no

970
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,500
So we have about 40 seconds

971
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,000
Early warning to Taipei

972
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,500
Of course, this concept is already underway.

973
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,500
I just wanna say it's a really good

974
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,000
The demo lets you see what the concept of early warning is

975
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Of course I don't now

976
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I need a signal received

977
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and then send out these times

978
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But in fact these are already being resolved

979
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Then of course when you arrive in Taipei City

980
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Use three-dimensional transmission in this management line

981
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It is very important to calculate this information

982
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Of course there are layers of problems in the Taipei Basin

983
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,500
These signals need to be higher and higher resolution

984
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,000
We can see the seismic waves inside the basin

985
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
how does it shake and how long does it shake

986
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So you'll talk about when Earthquake Island comes

987
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
how long did you shake

988
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
because the longer you shake

989
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Of course there will be some disasters

990
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
How long can I shake it

991
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
This matter is also included in the information

992
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
This is what I personally consider my second generation seismic domain

993
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,800
I hope my second-generation earthquake warning is based on the floor level and the degree of shaking

994
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,000
It can be included in the concept of earthquake early warning

995
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
These tasks are actually the basic information behind

996
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
high-resolution basic data

997
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,500
This is also back to the bright

998
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,800
At that time, we hoped that several scenes in the Taipei Basin

999
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,000
I can also play bright

1000
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,500
I can parse the whole related construct more clearly

1001
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,000
the whole job of course

1002
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,500
this is what i just mentioned

1003
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
We started 10 years ago

1004
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,000
It is the Taiwan earthquake model under the framework of the Taiwan Earthquake Science Center

1005
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,500
Cross-departmental committees cast all these tasks in

1006
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,500
For example, the Shanjiao fault that everyone is familiar with in the Taipei Basin

1007
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,500
that in order

1008
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,500
In fact, September of this year is the Xin-Chen Fault, which is on the Hsinchu side.

1009
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,500
So your drill in September is also calculated by us.

1010
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,500
That is, the exercise in September will focus on new and old faults

1011
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,000
Then next year will focus on Chiayi

1012
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
That is, we will continue to work with ministries related to the Ministry of the Interior

1013
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
to get to know them

1014
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
requirements on the application

1015
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
If you want to be accurate

1016
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
That is to say, you are talking about the simulation of seismic waves.

1017
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Since ten or twenty years ago

1018
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
very, very many people are developing

1019
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Then of course we mentioned that

1020
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
simulation

1021
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
It is already difficult to write programs for agents

1022
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
After you build someone else's program

1023
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You just enter and then output

1024
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Then let me tell you that you are garbage in garbage out

1025
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
who knows right

1026
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
So the simulation at that time was actually

1027
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It took a lot of effort to convince that

1028
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
ours is

1029
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
of scientific value is

1030
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
validation came out

1031
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Because of too many different simulations

1032
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
can come in

1033
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So we have to be very accurate

1034
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I know that the data I entered is

1035
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
is reliable

1036
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
We spent a lot of time on that part

1037
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
With earthquake engineering and with national units

1038
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
do this communication

1039
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So we can take all the criteria

1040
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
list them all

1041
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Then I just mentioned the structure of the entire basin

1042
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
We still have certain limitations in resolution

1043
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,720
So my current signal is about 0.5Hz for 2 seconds

1044
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,320
5 seconds but the real one seems to be 1Hz to 10Hz

1045
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,400
Then your resolution must be very high, and the calculation program must be very large.

1046
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,120
Then we certainly hope that the future fiber will allow us to do this work

1047
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,400
push the structural resolution of my basin to become clearer

1048
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,080
The other teacher who just talked about cooperation, Mr. Huang Xinhua

1049
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,800
he is making mountains

1050
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,200
When I use optical fiber, is it shaken by an earthquake?

1051
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,600
Or when it rains heavily, there will be landslides

1052
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,040
Can I monitor the display of landslides

1053
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,960
That's also supported by the plan of the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

1054
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,280
we're doing the big death part

1055
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,880
In addition to earthquakes, there are also extended disasters such as landslides.

1056
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,240
For example, there are basin structures but no basin structures

1057
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,280
You can see clearly that this is

1058
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,080
When there is a structure in the Taipei Basin

1059
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,960
You will see the seismic waves when the ship lands

1060
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,200
He just showed you

1061
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,300
This is Dr. Constitutionalist's calculation.

1062
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,240
his resonant behavior in

1063
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,160
but you will see say

1064
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,460
Because this is a triangle fault

1065
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,800
which we provided to the Ministry of the Interior

1066
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
You sometimes mentioned on the news that

1067
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,460
so-and-so member or whoever mentioned said

1068
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,100
If an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 occurs in Taipei,

1069
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,200
How many houses will collapse

1070
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,200
how many people were injured

1071
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,960
That's actually what we calculated

1072
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,100
Give it to NCDR to see their entire

1073
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,360
the structure of the house

1074
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,960
then start pushing

1075
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,920
Internal reinforcement

1076
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,260
even new building codes

1077
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,560
Then I think these tasks are slowly going on.

1078
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,760
Then you see it's still biting

1079
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,120
This part is over

1080
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
so this is

1081
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,420
Fine Velocity Structure

1082
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,920
allows us to calculate more precisely

1083
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,420
so i've been thinking

1084
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,720
From 5 to have is relatively simple

1085
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,620
but from there to better

1086
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,620
I think everyone has experience with this challenge

1087
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,720
You can pass the test to 80 points

1088
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,320
you score 80 to 90

1089
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,720
Efforts can also be achieved

1090
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,680
But you're going from 99 to 100

1091
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,980
1 point for this

1092
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,240
In fact, it takes a lot of effort

1093
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,040
So now we actually want to go from 80 to 90

1094
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,800
slowly push forward to better

1095
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,840
Is there a chance for this signal first?

1096
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,080
let's do this

1097
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,200
Of course it goes into the process

1098
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,240
This is the time to enter section 921

1099
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,720
nearby station

1100
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,560
These are protected from wind bridges, shot collapse, and so on.

1101
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,880
The most important thing is this very signal from the Cheung Chau flag

1102
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,800
This speed signal is a possible way

1103
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,360
A Cheung Chau flag signal

1104
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,800
Push the house down

1105
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,760
How did the Cheung Chau flag signal come from?

1106
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,560
At that time we published

1107
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,400
It was our TCTP at that time

1108
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,400
We publish in some of the top

1109
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,760
Journals to discuss

1110
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,040
how the hell did it happen

1111
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,360
For example, it's actually when an earthquake occurs

1112
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,680
it can also accelerate

1113
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,360
a speed

1114
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,160
But when it reaches its maximum speed

1115
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,240
My displacement continues to slide forward

1116
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,640
Because my section contains

1117
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,360
If it is a very detailed

1118
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:57,080
If the ring keeps slipping

1119
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,200
My minerals and time-lapse

1120
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
In fact, particles down to the nanometer

1121
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
When it comes to nano particles

1122
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I fact many thermodynamic influences

1123
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
my big doubts arise when i have

1124
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
smoperturization

1125
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
After letting my faults open

1126
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I'll slide forward even bigger

1127
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
that this part we are not

1128
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
There is a way for casting

1129
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
is that I can figure out that

1130
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
if a scale

1131
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
When reaching 7.0

1132
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
behavior like this happens

1133
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Then I for my disaster prevention work

1134
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
it is very important to understand

1135
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
But science is more important

1136
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
At that time in 9.1

1137
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Many scholars come to Taiwan

1138
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
He explored why an earthquake

1139
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
can have so much energy

1140
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Theoretically, the hard force generated by the crust

1141
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Shouldn't be that hard

1142
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
In fact it's all kinetic

1143
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It is a passive kinetic behavior

1144
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
of course now

1145
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Dynamics simulation can handle this matter

1146
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
is in the stage of development

1147
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
that kind of signal

1148
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
we asked for advice

1149
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
All scale 6.7 and above

1150
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,500
Like the 921G earthquake version 7.3 and the version 7.2 earthquake

1151
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,000
The Landes earthquake 7.2 is a large-scale earthquake

1152
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,500
But everyone should still remember the Meinong earthquake in 2016

1153
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Scale 6.4 Same as a Long period of ground motion

1154
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,500
This Long period of ground motion is no longer a

1155
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,000
think it may have happened by accident

1156
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
We now feel more and more that it is a physical phenomenon

1157
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,500
it is a physical phenomenon

1158
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,500
It's just that the seismic instruments were not placed so densely before.

1159
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,500
so no detection

1160
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,000
That's not to mention whether the future light may have the opportunity to see more

1161
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,500
That's why I say earthquake science is an observational science

1162
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Had a lot of conversations with everyone in the engineering world

1163
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,500
The engineering world used to tell me back then

1164
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Of course we have an earthquake culture preschool attempt

1165
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
He told me, Mr. Meng, you gave too much shock

1166
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,000
This way you can find a way to make it smaller

1167
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Then I thought about how to think about it

1168
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
This is data, I can't think of a way

1169
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
it is data

1170
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,120
But in terms of data, they mean

1171
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,800
In our previous earthquake engineering, it was

1172
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,620
More than about magnitude 5

1173
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,000
my house fell down

1174
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,400
In fact we found

1175
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,860
A Taiwan egg with a magnitude of 5 may be a well-built house

1176
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,300
That's not all down

1177
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,060
So something actually

1178
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:17,960
I need to do a lot of dialogue and exploration.

1179
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,760
So from the beginning I thought

1180
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,920
This Cheung Chau writing signal happened by accident

1181
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,800
Up to now, our building regulations in Taiwan

1182
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,860
New building codes have broken into earthquakes

1183
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,820
These building codes all come in

1184
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,980
It was Cheung Chau who wrote the shock

1185
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,680
Buildings cannot be built in generations

1186
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,120
if you have a private building

1187
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,320
You must do a special review

1188
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,220
In fact, this part is included in the laws and regulations.

1189
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,620
it's my pleasure to have the opportunity

1190
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,320
More conversations with engineering

1191
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,320
Then wait a minute and I can introduce you

1192
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,060
It is in our MIDASData

1193
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,280
See the phenomenon that Cheung Chau wrote to shake it

1194
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,180
It is actually a fractured structure

1195
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,320
caused by the phenomenon

1196
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,640
Okay, that's what I just said

1197
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,040
The Chigami Earthquake of September 18

1198
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,800
It was the earthquake three months ago

1199
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,960
four months

1200
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,960
You may have seen this on the news

1201
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,000
these bridges fell

1202
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,480
Semi-11 in that domain is down here

1203
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,440
It's just like a very Long period of ground motion

1204
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,840
caused this disaster

1205
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,440
But some of the same signals are disconnected

1206
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,600
That's what I mentioned to the weather bureau

1207
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,240
We want a Resilient Society

1208
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,800
But we want Resilient Instrumentation

1209
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,400
How do we make earthquakes come

1210
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,360
My station on the nearest fault won't be disconnected

1211
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,120
Because many of my research materials need near-fault data

1212
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,640
then this is a challenge

1213
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,200
Of course I'm actually in the domain

1214
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,440
I set up some stations to see its signal

1215
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:43,720
good

1216
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,680
Okay, so back to the phenomena we were talking about

1217
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,640
of course i want to say

1218
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,560
Why am I talking to the side of the earth?

1219
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,880
Let's mention this key breakthrough plan from the Intermediate People's Court.

1220
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,400
because i know it's risky

1221
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,880
I will thank the hospital for mentioning that

1222
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,600
The essential

1223
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
In fact they understand the risks

1224
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I don't know if it will work

1225
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
but i think it's an opportunity

1226
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So I propose to try this

1227
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And at that time, I actually mentioned it to Taipower

1228
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Carbon dioxide sequesters these things

1229
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But everyone is very conservative about the light

1230
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Then go back to Academia Sinica personally

1231
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It is an honor to come to Academia Sinica

1232
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I know what we're going to do is a lookahead

1233
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Lead us to Taiwan to challenge a new

1234
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The possibility of scientific development

1235
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
that's nice to have a chance we made it

1236
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So start having a lot of conversations

1237
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
i can't say we succeeded

1238
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It should be said that we put it in

1239
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
The data research is still in the process of writing

1240
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Then this is us

1241
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
At least we are technically successful

1242
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
We even have conversations with Chunghwa Telecom

1243
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
We have a signal that uses Chunghwa Telecom's dialogue

1244
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
because the real purpose is

1245
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
All cables in Taiwan

1246
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
can become our signal

1247
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and submarine cables

1248
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
But it's a big challenge just take it step by step

1249
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,640
When I mentioned it to the hospital, I said

1250
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,800
In addition to these applications

1251
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,640
Not to mention the Millennium Fault

1252
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,600
Probably the most active fault in the world

1253
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,000
Every 70 years

1254
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,120
And it moves exactly the same

1255
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,600
This was moved in 1951

1256
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,600
It's exactly the same as in 2016

1257
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,800
In fact, the Ikegami Fault

1258
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,560
2022 Ikegami earthquake dynamic position

1259
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,560
It is exactly the same as the Yuli fault in 1951

1260
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,320
After the earthquake

1261
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,080
we've been thinking

1262
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,840
In 1951, this series of steam-scale earthquakes

1263
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,120
happen within two months

1264
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,040
what will its condition be like

1265
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,120
Seismic activity was high at the time

1266
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,840
So at that time, the chairman of the National Science Council

1267
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,240
At that time, he was the Minister of Science and Technology

1268
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,720
Also hold a meeting with us to understand

1269
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,240
What is the nature of its earthquake

1270
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,600
Well, Bai Guangguang once said

1271
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,360
Murren Fault it's already clear

1272
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,680
It is related to the Ryukyu Trench

1273
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,400
I just mentioned past life on scale 8.0

1274
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,600
Everyone is on the news sometimes

1275
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,160
What century-old politics are you referring to?

1276
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,160
since 1920

1277
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,460
A magnitude 8 earthquake

1278
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:04,400
Not to mention its entire fault system is linked together

1279
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,240
If an earthquake warning

1280
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,360
It should be said before the earthquake

1281
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,200
it is also possible opportunity

1282
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,800
So not to mention I was hoping to make a

1283
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,500
The biggest experiment is how I put the fiber

1284
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:20,200
Because the matter of optical fiber has been talked about for two or three years

1285
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
In fact, it has been talked about for a long time at home and abroad.

1286
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,860
It's just that there has been no actual operation

1287
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,000
my seminar abroad

1288
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,740
Of course the time of COVID caused some trouble

1289
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,540
But when in seminars abroad

1290
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:31,440
listen to me

1291
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,040
郭鳳,you have to talk about optical fiber

1292
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,940
I've been thinking that I'm going to smoke this hilarious

1293
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,040
You know sometimes scientific research

1294
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,940
still has some feeling of federation

1295
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,940
which thing is particularly popular at a certain time

1296
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,040
I want to say I don't want to dare to be popular

1297
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,440
But I feel more and more

1298
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,440
it may be the future

1299
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,640
if it is the future

1300
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,640
of course i want to try it

1301
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,840
what does it look like

1302
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,740
let me warm up

1303
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,040
that's to say nothing of me stepping over the fault line

1304
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,640
What does a fault look like?

1305
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,140
that just mentioned

1306
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
All over the world if I have fiber optics in all locations

1307
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,800
can i put the fault under the ground

1308
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,000
clearer

1309
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I'll put the location where I know the fault first.

1310
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Is it possible for me to go in the future?

1311
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,400
Test other faults first

1312
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
so i

1313
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,400
This is actually a bit of that

1314
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
already know the answer

1315
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,400
But I still want to know

1316
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,400
What does his answer look like?

1317
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,400
so we are here

1318
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,900
Seven Star Altar Very beautiful Seven Star Altar

1319
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,400
This is the Murren Fault

1320
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
We have a well A and a well B

1321
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
This is the upper plate This is the lower plate

1322
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,400
I want to be a control group

1323
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,400
Then in Well C

1324
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,400
We measure water, air and temperature

1325
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Do earthquake light and seismic energy detection

1326
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
the real challenge is

1327
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,400
I'm going to take an optical fiber directly from the surface

1328
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,400
all the way down

1329
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,400
700 meters position

1330
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,400
That's a big challenge

1331
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,400
we have to first

1332
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
Of course I still have to say

1333
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
Then don't talk so much about your heart today.

1334
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,400
That

1335
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,400
that because of covid

1336
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
I play the first time swing fiber optic

1337
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,120
To manipulate the light you have to have absolutely no folds

1338
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,060
Then if you want 100, it takes a day

1339
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,000
One hundred to seven hundred meters in one go

1340
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,960
Then our approach is on Jing A's side.

1341
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:16,920
there's a light starting to come down

1342
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,380
Go down to the suite

1343
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,700
then go up

1344
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,120
Then cross this scene A and go up and down

1345
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,920
Go east and go to Qixing

1346
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,000
It's where Murren Heights is

1347
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
In fact, the fire department in Hualien is going to connect us now

1348
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,500
Do disaster prevention education

1349
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:34,000
Then go back to Scene A

1350
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
I use Chunghwa Telecom for this section of blue

1351
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We had a long discussion with Chunghwa Telecom

1352
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So they now use our Chunghwa Telecom

1353
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
For our work, they are going to fight for Taiwan's sustainable award

1354
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The first time we talked to him

1355
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,000
How to put business work and forward-looking science together

1356
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Thanks to Lin Qingren and Huang Xinhua

1357
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
They put a lot of effort into dialogue

1358
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Chunghwa Telecom

1359
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,600
The main reason is that there are many houses here

1360
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,300
It is also impossible for us to dig any location

1361
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,300
Chunghwa Telecom

1362
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,500
Then he closes and continues up and down

1363
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,000
Then go to Qixingtan to cross the whole border

1364
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So we become a three-dimensional

1365
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
monitoring of the entire signal

1366
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,600
We are now writing our article

1367
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,600
But we in China say that I will extend my salary

1368
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,600
The salary extension of this special policeman actually took a lot of effort

1369
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,600
Well of course this is a long story to tell

1370
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,100
If you are interested

1371
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:35,100
That reporter has been following us for two years

1372
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:38,100
So his reporter wrote a very good article last year

1373
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,100
And China TV News Magazine

1374
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:45,100
And Dong Sen has come to make these documentaries

1375
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,100
So if you are interested

1376
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,100
You can read their reports

1377
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,100
I just mentioned that, of course I can't say

1378
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,600
Hit it out of nowhere

1379
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,100
Explain that at the beginning, of course, many policies

1380
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,100
This is after we must have done a lot of thinking

1381
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,100
I need to know that I'm actually certain that I'm going to fight

1382
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,400
about my location

1383
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,600
But it's not just talking about fighting

1384
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,700
People may not be willing to let us fight, right?

1385
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,900
And then again in such a beautiful place as Qixingtan

1386
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,400
I went there and thought Chihsingtan is really, really beautiful.

1387
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,000
We hope to combine this work with sightseeing

1388
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Combined with disaster prevention education

1389
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,800
Therefore, in the selection of the whole field

1390
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,700
we spent a year

1391
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,000
Convince Hualien County Government

1392
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,500
Disaster Prevention Office Central Disaster Prevention Office

1393
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:29,500
Our director went to Hualien and so on

1394
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,000
do a lot of public hearings

1395
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,500
Tell local residents why we do this work

1396
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,000
It took us a year

1397
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,500
all clerical visits

1398
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,700
I am grateful that is the House of Representatives

1399
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,000
some executives of key breakthroughs

1400
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,300
and hospital administrators

1401
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,500
help with a lot of work

1402
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:46,500
Chunghwa Telecom

1403
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,700
Chunghwa Telecom told us at the beginning that we would

1404
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,800
You have to charge us 300,000,500,000 a year

1405
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,300
1.5 million in three years

1406
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,200
I want to say we don't have the funds

1407
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,700
So we convinced a lot

1408
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,900
tell him why

1409
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,300
what do you think about this

1410
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,300
Chunghwa Telecom

1411
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
is also worth it

1412
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,000
So it took a lot of work to have this conversation

1413
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
So thanks to the many teams and all the observations in the field

1414
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
This whole thing took about a year to start earning

1415
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Start earning, of course the key is of course very big

1416
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
is when we reach earning generation

1417
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I have been worrying together all the time

1418
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
We took the exam for two months

1419
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
When I took the exam, I thought it was great.

1420
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
It should be that we reach Earn Generation

1421
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
But at the same time, I feel that I can't make money, what should I do?

1422
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
At that time, it was said that the hospital's plan was to talk about it.

1423
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Mr. Mao, your knowledge rate is too low

1424
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You need to finish it quickly

1425
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
So there's a lot of dialogue probably with the colonial side

1426
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
or the office on this side of the courtyard

1427
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Quick Technician does a lot of dialogue

1428
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
i can't give up

1429
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
But it was impossible for me to give to the money-making company the year before last

1430
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I have to be in place before I can give

1431
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Then this is fiber optic

1432
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
too much on this story

1433
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I will tell the result directly

1434
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
This is the fiber that actually runs from the UK

1435
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,200
COVID is very serious

1436
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,120
So when his instrument comes

1437
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,880
We put it in the middle of the situation for two months

1438
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,760
no one dares to touch it

1439
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,520
The British company is coming

1440
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,400
found the company

1441
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,840
We've spent all the money the madman cleared.

1442
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,320
It's impossible to make money from negative companies

1443
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,460
so by us young people

1444
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,520
Ph.D. Dr. Gu Jinshang

1445
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:22,160
And these drilling teams

1446
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,400
step by step to design

1447
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,120
Because when I take the whole case

1448
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,760
fiber next to me

1449
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,200
I can't fold the fiber

1450
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,960
But I want very good copying

1451
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,760
Then I'm going to fix it really well

1452
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,080
So the whole technique has been practiced N hundred times

1453
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,080
That is, every step we take every step to achieve

1454
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,320
Then I thank the British team

1455
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,760
at christmas time

1456
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,200
he is video chatting with us

1457
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,720
Our optical fiber was launched in December last year

1458
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,960
It should be the year before last

1459
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,360
December 31

1460
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,680
That's really the first signal coming in

1461
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,600
is January 1, 2022

1462
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,360
We are all welcoming the sunrise at Qixingtan

1463
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,320
In fact, there is no place to live

1464
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,960
Because Qixingtan is full

1465
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,680
So we are in fact

1466
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,000
Everyone find a place by themselves

1467
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,060
to finish but just happy

1468
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,140
When the signal is completed

1469
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,700
But Taiwan is not worried about earthquakes at all, the signal will come in immediately

1470
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,240
ok then this is

1471
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,540
Scene A on January 1, 2022

1472
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,880
Scene B on June 2, 2022

1473
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,960
In other words, June 2, 2022

1474
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,400
Our entire circuit is complete.

1475
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,600
That is, as soon as we put it down,

1476
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,160
Must be all 24 hours at once so

1477
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,320
And put all the wiring together

1478
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,560
is the completion of our entire signal

1479
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,840
follow the operation

1480
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,220
I think it's really about the signal of an earthquake.

1481
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,760
That's what it said

1482
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,180
Yes, all the work, is it worth it?

1483
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,020
I've actually been thinking

1484
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,140
for what

1485
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,400
my signal is beautiful

1486
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,300
At that time this was

1487
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,640
You see, it starts to go down on January 1st.

1488
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,260
I face the computer every day

1489
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:55,640
The earthquake on January 7, an earthquake in Taichung

1490
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,080
I think earthquakes are really good

1491
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,100
Because it has a scale of 4.7, it is neither too big nor too small, and it is very deep.

1492
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,200
So its signal to our station is almost vertically rounded

1493
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,720
I saw this signal and thought it was so beautiful

1494
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,920
but i mean earthquake repair

1495
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,280
so i feel very beautiful

1496
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,920
This is from the ground to the ground

1497
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:13,960
then it is symmetrical

1498
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,800
I just told me to go down

1499
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,600
then up again

1500
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,720
you can see it's symmetrical

1501
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,560
then you can see

1502
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,240
This is a two-second signal

1503
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,080
I can see when the batch comes in

1504
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,840
Then I've seen some disturbances in these

1505
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,960
These disturbances are seismic zones

1506
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,240
fault zone

1507
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,920
then i see some facial zone

1508
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,000
I am one and then how does the seismic wave reflect the selective shot

1509
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,800
I can see everything clearly

1510
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,640
Even so

1511
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,000
I'm still staring at it in a daze

1512
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,160
So what can you do?

1513
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:41,960
Ok

1514
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,320
You guys beautiful and then

1515
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,960
so I've been thinking about it

1516
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,680
But there are more and more important discoveries

1517
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,560
For example this is the same as an earthquake

1518
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,160
Of course I drew it in a better way

1519
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,400
you can see

1520
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,260
4 meters, sorry, forgot to mention

1521
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:02,060
we are one

1522
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,300
We have a resolution of 4 meters

1523
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,100
Then the signal is 1000Hz

1524
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,220
So it has a very, very large amount of data

1525
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,160
Of course we have to treat it as

1526
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,500
When sample to 200Hz

1527
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,200
Then we also follow what we get

1528
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,100
The grid center of our courtyard

1529
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,260
Thanks to Mr. Liang Wenzhong

1530
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,100
They have collaborated many times before

1531
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,100
on some basis of

1532
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,900
Do this same conversation with the grid center

1533
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,900
Our data is sent to the grid center

1534
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,700
Then our grid center has

1535
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,060
When we analyze data

1536
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,900
Put data directly from the center of the grid

1537
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,300
extract

1538
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,060
then this part is

1539
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,800
Collaboration between many units in the hospital

1540
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,100
then we

1541
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:36,800
An earthquake is coming up from below

1542
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,300
You can see this signal below

1543
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,500
It's standing in a row, it's quite beautiful

1544
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,300
After reaching the fault, it was disturbed

1545
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,100
then you have surface reflection

1546
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,300
Then your batch comes in

1547
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,500
your signal

1548
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,300
The structure of each signal and formation

1549
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,700
Can simulate one by one

1550
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,900
for real

1551
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,300
don't do any analysis at all

1552
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,600
You can see where it says I'm close to the fault line

1553
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,700
The whole government is amplified

1554
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,500
remember what i just mentioned

1555
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,000
Cheung Chau flag shakes near fault

1556
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,800
In this example it is

1557
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,500
you don't move anything

1558
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,300
you actually see it is fault behavior

1559
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,300
it doesn't happen randomly either

1560
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,300
As long as your fault zone is certain

1561
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,500
The difference in material

1562
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,500
it produces a government amplification

1563
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,400
fault zone

1564
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,800
not very clear

1565
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,300
about 20 meters

1566
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,100
Then this is a fault zone only 20 meters

1567
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,500
So, if you take Jinxia earthquake today

1568
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,100
you'll miss it too

1569
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,400
because after you cross the fault zone

1570
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,300
It behaves exactly the same

1571
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,400
So you can only rely on this very high resolution

1572
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,800
Only then can you know if your long fingers have been magnified

1573
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,300
Did you really see the Yanpan signal?

1574
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,200
Going back to the beginning of the earthquake just mentioned

1575
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,600
0.01 seconds how long is it

1576
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,500
If you look at it from a shallower position

1577
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,900
it has been disturbed

1578
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,000
what you really want to see is

1579
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,300
You have to start looking at the Yanpan signal

1580
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,200
This is what we now want to continue to

1581
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,840
Inquiry, if I detect a magnitude 1, magnitude 2 earthquake

1582
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,160
Its initial signal that it is certain

1583
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,480
Hold on to the relationship on the road to explore

1584
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,280
that this

1585
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,360
Of course, there are many discussions about fault generations.

1586
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,160
For example say I am in my three months

1587
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,480
This fault generation was mentioned in the AGU seminar in the United States

1588
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,780
Then many people must want to say when did you see this fault generation

1589
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:27,400
The most important value of this job is that we can also gain

1590
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:31,760
This word heart is just a double stare after I take it in.

1591
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,080
I took out Yanxin and could see very fine fault mud

1592
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,640
Just mentioned that it's stuck all over the drill

1593
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,480
Our drill bits are actually very hard, even diamond bits

1594
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:45,080
But because this has been informed to Nano, there is a lot of water

1595
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,880
So when my drill goes in, the whole

1596
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:52,480
You just cover it all up so my drill bit can't move the hole at all

1597
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,800
So the whole technical thing

1598
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,800
It took about two months

1599
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,960
Then I also think our Taiwan team

1600
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,640
The engineering team is also very strong

1601
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,140
He also understands that our work is a scientific challenge

1602
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,680
so he is not in a hurry

1603
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,740
But he is also in a hurry

1604
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:13,580
Because they still have a lot of geothermal greed projects to implement

1605
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:14,600
he mentioned

1606
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,380
Mom, teacher, if you don't continue to specialize

1607
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,200
I'm about to be fined again for my civil service plan

1608
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,480
because I'm tired

1609
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,540
But thank you all for some support

1610
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,860
This is very important. It can be seen from the heart.

1611
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,140
Of course the words

1612
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,500
The same is that you can publish many top-level articles

1613
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,540
because the behavior of the entire fault zone

1614
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,120
It depends on these territorial studies

1615
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,440
Then these are some English students of my summer vacation

1616
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,500
This is Lai Xuanrong, he told me he would come today

1617
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,780
then during the summer vacation

1618
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:46,600
Let's look at some data from Taiwan for several months

1619
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,880
you can see the fault line

1620
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,440
Every earthquake he is a continuous amplification

1621
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,720
The location of this fault zone

1622
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,500
Then see Decay on the surface

1623
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,060
But the upper plate has a relatively large magnification

1624
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,320
It's Decay

1625
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,100
So at that time, I often said that you bought a house

1626
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Be sure to buy the lower order, don't buy the upper order

1627
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,680
that of course means

1628
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:05,680
You need to know where your upper plate is and where your lower plate is

1629
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:06,840
that or

1630
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,480
But Taiwan has many faults

1631
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,200
So the footwall on your side may be the hanging wall of another fault.

1632
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,800
So the standard of the whole struggle is the real

1633
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,080
place to analyze

1634
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,080
But this is very important to understand

1635
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,480
then you fault

1636
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,680
When you get close, you see your whole government zoom in

1637
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:22,760
abnormally long

1638
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,160
But on the sidelines the whole thing changes

1639
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,280
So this is actually

1640
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,880
We are talking about this change in history

1641
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,240
That's as far as we mentioned back then

1642
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,360
A scale as small as this is 20 meters

1643
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,360
So of course small earthquakes we can see very clearly

1644
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:39,040
But the far positive signal comes in for a few seconds

1645
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:42,920
That is, my wave is already a signal of more than 10 seconds

1646
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,360
how can i still see it

1647
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,760
but we're far away

1648
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,240
still see it zoomed in

1649
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,000
That's the article we're writing right now

1650
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,080
just to explain

1651
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,960
The reason for this magnification is actually the material of the fault zone itself

1652
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,520
It's Lumps constant

1653
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,560
when changes occur

1654
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,720
It has some government amplification factors in it

1655
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
This part is very important to say

1656
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,600
We've been talking about earthquake induced

1657
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:06,920
I don't know if you guys mentioned it on the news

1658
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,920
After the Great East Japan Earthquake

1659
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,680
Earthquakes all over the world turned into gunpowder

1660
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:15,560
Also, after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami in 2004

1661
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,680
Everyone has heard that earthquakes all over the world seem to turn into gunpowder

1662
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,840
The reporter asked

1663
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,480
Teacher Meng, do you think this is related?

1664
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,400
Let's say it's a different board

1665
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,400
But in fact, we actually feel in our hearts that

1666
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,400
Indeed its behavior is amplified

1667
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,000
That's why we haven't found the theory

1668
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,280
But when working with this

1669
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,400
I think it's a good inspiration to say

1670
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,240
So no matter how far the earthquake comes from

1671
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,760
if you have fault

1672
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,760
your strain will be magnified

1673
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:41,920
so what

1674
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,920
if your self faults itself

1675
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:48,200
It belongs to the critical academic situation

1676
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,720
you are easily induced

1677
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,880
So this is of course another article that I think can be developed

1678
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,840
That is, my fault zone is not just the near fault.

1679
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,440
Is far positive fault I will also be excited

1680
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,960
Actually how much is it

1681
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
So maybe it can explain

1682
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,840
Why the scale of the world

1683
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,320
More than eight large-scale earthquakes

1684
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,680
Seismic activity around the world has increased

1685
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,040
that means otherwise

1686
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,160
There are many faults in our Taiwan agent

1687
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,800
so i can put fiber

1688
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,040
can see some signals

1689
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:15,240
but to europe

1690
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,760
or to other countries

1691
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,720
Earthquakes are not as active as we are

1692
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,920
but they still need to know

1693
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,520
where is the fault

1694
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:23,480
If he puts the optical fiber

1695
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,560
He doesn't have to wait for the earthquake next to him

1696
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,080
Earthquakes around the world

1697
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,240
he has a chance

1698
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,280
Know where his fault is

1699
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,840
So this is what I think is a

1700
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,600
very important application

1701
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,960
That's Chunghwa Telecom

1702
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,960
Chunghwa Telecom's signal

1703
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,400
Of course not as beautiful as we thought

1704
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,480
because it is along

1705
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,000
The ditch goes like this

1706
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,960
but

1707
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,120
We've been doing analysis with them

1708
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,240
but you can see

1709
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,160
But our job is to see some

1710
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,000
enlarged

1711
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,960
Continuous zoom position

1712
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,760
This is actually the same as our wild

1713
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,560
The tomographic magnification position is the same

1714
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,720
So Chunghwa Telecom's signal

1715
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,080
Our future challenge is to

1716
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,920
how do i put him

1717
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It works by applying the above

1718
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,700
business work

1719
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,600
applied to our science

1720
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,500
Then there are these reflections on the surface and so on.

1721
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,400
I think this might be too thin

1722
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,800
that real other job

1723
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,700
For example, how did my fault break?

1724
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,400
Like the March 22 earthquake

1725
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,900
I have a total of small earthquakes

1726
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,500
I can work out the mechanics of massive earthquakes

1727
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,700
this is what we do

1728
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,400
inside a fault

1729
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,000
This is the same from the bottom to the top

1730
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,800
i can every second

1731
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,500
I saw a patch

1732
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,200
That is to say, above the fault level

1733
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,100
it actually has several

1734
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,700
The so-called patch is composed of

1735
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,800
Then each patch

1736
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,400
There will be the possibility of the signal from Cheung Chau

1737
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,000
This is another scientific challenge

1738
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,300
It is because when we did the analysis in this area before

1739
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,900
They all use signals from Cheung Chau

1740
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,800
The previous signal took about 2 to 30 seconds

1741
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,600
2 to 30 seconds

1742
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,700
P-POS 6 kilometers per second

1743
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,000
Your resolution is 10 km

1744
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,800
so you'll see our fault line

1745
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,500
Calculation is very smooth

1746
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:00,100
with current mechanics

1747
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,600
With the signal of the present light now

1748
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,160
I'm up to 1000Hz to

1749
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:06,260
This is a direction signal at least 200Hz at 200Hz

1750
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:09,100
I can map every piece of every piece

1751
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,600
Then we are working with Captain now

1752
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,500
it's my mechanics

1753
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,900
how do i break from one piece to another

1754
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,600
after the earthquake

1755
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,500
Going back to how the earthquake happened

1756
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,300
its a cascadia act

1757
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:24,700
If it encounters a relatively large Stress

1758
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:27,100
It's about accumulating energy around here

1759
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,500
Then on a Patch I just mentioned

1760
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:33,000
It actually continues to break forward after accumulating energy.

1761
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,600
to what extent is it accumulating

1762
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,700
it will stop

1763
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,800
That's what I think the light is about.

1764
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
future available jobs

1765
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,000
But I'm talking on paper now

1766
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,400
All I can say right now is that I see the signal

1767
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,100
I'm thinking

1768
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,900
Inside the new Generation

1769
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,600
what can we do

1770
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,700
Then of course I hope I have a chance in the future

1771
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,400
verify my ideal

1772
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,400
Of course the same

1773
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,100
Earthquake early warning work

1774
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,100
its whole signal

1775
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,200
actually huge

1776
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,000
So it is absolutely necessary to use the technology of AI

1777
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,500
Because we have a way to wait until we take it one by one

1778
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,000
So how do I use whatever Visualization

1779
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
That is, I use images to directly respond to the strain

1780
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Or when the documents come in, I will scan them first.

1781
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,500
Do training in this area

1782
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:23,000
This is our work combined with big data

1783
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And how to analyze the coupling of the entire data, etc.

1784
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
It's all done step by step

1785
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
So I'm probably going the easy way today

1786
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Let me introduce to you the coming of this light generation

1787
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
But I don't know if I really have the means to achieve my ideal

1788
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But I think it's a start

1789
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Then at least the key to this technology

1790
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Work on current energy, green energy, etc.

1791
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Initiative work can be produced

1792
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Then our place is very beautiful

1793
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Welcome to Qixingtan when you are free

1794
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Then our place, I also hope that it will become a work of education.

1795
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Then

1796
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,300
Today a seminar in Japan is held here

1797
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,860
We will also do these related discussions here

1798
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,680
I hope this is a start

1799
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:11,260
Then last week, I know that some units have already visited

1800
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,060
I want to know how they're going

1801
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,880
It is currently technically feasible

1802
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:18,680
I also hope to have more opportunities to share with you

1803
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,200
Thanks

1804
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:27,400
Okay, we are very grateful to Mr. Ma Guofeng for giving us

1805
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,440
such a brilliant speech

1806
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:32,520
Indeed, Qixingtan is a very beautiful place.

1807
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,300
If you have ever been

1808
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,880
then we start now

1809
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,720
Open to questions on site

1810
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,280
In particular, I want to announce that

1811
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:47,880
Top 10 Questions

1812
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:49,400
audience friends

1813
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:53,000
You can get a 9-pound flat souvenir

1814
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,780
here we are

1815
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,580
Secretariat staff will

1816
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:58,360
will be delivered to you

1817
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,900
ok so now everyone

1818
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,500
Raise your hand if you have any questions

1819
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,700
Then you have a microphone in front of your desk

1820
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,960
The problem with pressing the microphone down

1821
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,760
we can all hear

1822
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,700
ok sir please

1823
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,500
i have a lot of questions

1824
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,000
But first I ask two questions

1825
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,500
The first question is the fault just mentioned

1826
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Our intuition in signaling

1827
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,500
basically a resonance

1828
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,500
It seems that there is no so-called resonance problem on the fault side.

1829
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:35,700
i don't know if

1830
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:37,700
but we have another problem

1831
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:39,700
Cascade just mentioned

1832
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:44,000
That is to say it has something of this wave that it reflects

1833
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,200
So there's an exposure wave and there's a reflection

1834
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,000
reflection in reflection

1835
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,100
So it could very well turn into a so-called positive backtracking

1836
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,600
Positivity of the feedback

1837
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,000
Make it taller than that Embed to

1838
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,300
I don't want it, right?

1839
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,000
But it is interesting to say that the fault

1840
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
This looks like its Mesh is that quality

1841
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
It seems like these problems are resonating with

1842
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Or the NPU becomes larger

1843
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
It seems that it doesn't matter much

1844
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But I'm curious, so let's find out

1845
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
The second question is that I ask first

1846
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
have a question about communication

1847
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You only rely on Fiber or sending signals

1848
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Does it look like it's still being used?

1849
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Other communication systems are doing the dissemination

1850
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
because actually

1851
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I happened to be in Dulan for the earthquake in Chishang

1852
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I'm actually standing on a board

1853
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
i fell

1854
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
But we are not afraid of earthquakes

1855
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Because there is a distance of 1 kilometer between the residents there

1856
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
so you just look at that

1857
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Seems like it won't fall off

1858
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
you won't run

1859
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
i mean

1860
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Fiber laid by Chunghwa Telecom

1861
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's actually on the East Coast on Coastal Highway 11

1862
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
It's actually pretty bad

1863
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
That is to say, the transmission rate

1864
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
is bad

1865
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,600
so you put Hualien

1866
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,300
I think Qixingtan may be a good location

1867
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,000
The question is how to manage it

1868
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,100
So I guess the part about the newsletter

1869
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,800
I want to ask here to compare

1870
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,600
Thanks

1871
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,100
ok i'll be the first to mention

1872
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:17,200
The incident wave you just mentioned

1873
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,600
reflection

1874
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,600
reflection is completely simulated by us

1875
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,100
So the three-dimensional vibration simulation just mentioned

1876
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,000
just doing

1877
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So in terms of the fault zone

1878
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,700
is all our trip waves

1879
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:28,200
That is, I may have a signal in it

1880
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
Then of course it was previously thought

1881
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,500
Government Amplification of the Fault Zone

1882
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
May be caused by trip wave

1883
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,200
Then our current analyst sees that

1884
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,600
In fact, it is caused by the difference of materials

1885
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,300
Of course it may also appear as a trip wave

1886
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,500
just say our biggest key

1887
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,000
It's not just a trip wave

1888
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
this is one

1889
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,500
Then if you briefly mention

1890
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,800
the signal you just said

1891
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,700
it's two things

1892
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:53,200
We just use fiber optics as a tool

1893
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,800
The transmission of the signal depends on

1894
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,300
Wi-Fi

1895
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,300
or

1896
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,100
Of course, the two elders have just

1897
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
see it near you

1898
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,400
The data of our Proband

1899
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,400
some even rely on artificial satellites

1900
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,400
on various

1901
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,900
Then we just talked about Chunghwa Telecom's fiber

1902
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,900
Not all fibers can be used

1903
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,900
If you're that kind of Black Fiber

1904
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,900
In fact it still doesn't work

1905
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:18,900
So you have to go to fiber optic 5G

1906
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,900
part like this

1907
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,400
Therefore we now

1908
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,400
Chunghwa Telecom is in Midas

1909
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,400
fiber optics

1910
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,900
because I'm going to the depths

1911
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,900
I have to resist temperature and pressure

1912
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,900
So my fiber optic is actually

1913
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,900
Not affected by temperature and pressure at all

1914
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:35,900
then we just want to say

1915
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,900
If it is really going to be popularized

1916
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,900
We can't do it all by ourselves

1917
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,900
So we're going to use the commercial

1918
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,900
that commercial

1919
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:46,900
He can't do it for us

1920
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,900
So we have to strike a balance in the middle

1921
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,900
So his Maintain is completely

1922
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,900
commercial company

1923
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:54,900
Maintain themselves

1924
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,900
Our future cooperation of course

1925
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:57,900
hope is to say

1926
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,900
I know

1927
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Two researchers in China and ancient and modern times

1928
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,400
They also have a relationship with Chunghwa Telecom in Taipei

1929
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,400
Because you know some of Chunghwa Telecom's grids

1930
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,900
Not every paragraph can be used

1931
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,400
because you must have a loop

1932
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,400
They first try a circuit for analysis

1933
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,900
it's the same

1934
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,100
Tell him about our negative life here

1935
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,100
very expensive

1936
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:23,300
They want 300,000 a month

1937
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,500
then we feel

1938
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,100
what am i going to try

1939
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,900
Can I try it for a week?

1940
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,000
don't try for a month

1941
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,600
But this is in a speculative stage

1942
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,600
So I just said

1943
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,600
These fibers on the East Coast

1944
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,800
Chunghwa These cables may not work yet

1945
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,400
but we're talking about the future

1946
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,400
Because the optical fiber in the future must be better and better

1947
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,300
Probably the simple answer is this

1948
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,000
Thanks

1949
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,400
Okay, thank you

1950
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,700
we'll follow

1951
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:53,100
ok that one is behind

1952
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,300
Okay, thank you

1953
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,520
Because it means 5.5 and above will have that

1954
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,600
Is that the transmission tube?

1955
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,600
It's an emergency signal.

1956
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,440
then again

1957
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,440
if you are in

1958
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,040
If it is located in Zhenyang

1959
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,040
you won't

1960
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,540
when you get the signal

1961
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:22,040
you already happened

1962
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Does that mean that if

1963
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,400
feel an earthquake

1964
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,400
then heard the signal

1965
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,560
that means this

1966
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,560
I am facing this

1967
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,560
This earthquake will be severe

1968
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,060
Duality will also be more serious

1969
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:37,060
this means

1970
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:39,060
That's right.

1971
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:39,560
right

1972
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,560
but

1973
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,060
I must say that now we are doing

1974
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:46,060
The so-called method of earthquake prevention and disaster reduction is

1975
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,060
Just a little shock

1976
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,060
Nothing will happen to Xiao Zhen

1977
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,060
Moderate earthquake

1978
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:53,060
A moderate earthquake, a major earthquake, etc.

1979
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,060
such a concept

1980
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,060
is how we keep our defenses on cover

1981
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,060
Even if it is an earthquake resistance specification

1982
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,960
There is no way to meet such a large standard of resistance

1983
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,340
but it's slanted

1984
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,120
instead of whole crushed

1985
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,640
It's not like the whole building of the pseudo-officials fell down.

1986
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,680
The man has absolutely no hope of surviving.

1987
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,000
but

1988
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,600
It is impossible to make it infinitely superior to the earthquake resistance code

1989
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,680
So because it still has some cost considerations

1990
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,640
So it is indeed a means of earthquake early warning

1991
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:26,080
But it's not entirely possible to do all the work around

1992
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,880
Shock resistance is still important

1993
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,920
That's why I said

1994
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,240
We're talking to the Ministry of the Interior

1995
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,440
old house reconstruction etc.

1996
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,640
When I mentioned it to the Ministry of the Interior, I found out that

1997
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,040
Many units actually

1998
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:42,280
That is, they put about 3 billion yuan for earthquake resistance

1999
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,200
Earthquake resistance assessment but no one came to apply

2000
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,440
There is no one to apply for the reconstruction of the old house

2001
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:50,120
That of course starts with everyone's information

2002
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,880
They think that if I apply today,

2003
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,680
Am I not here without shadow three hundred taels?

2004
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,280
Say later that my house is not good

2005
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,440
That's the concept we're pushing

2006
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,640
Just like all of you here

2007
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:00,000
just say

2008
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,600
In fact, the disclosure of information allows everyone to do things more bravely

2009
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,160
Because when your information is not public

2010
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,220
you actually grow

2011
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:11,260
when it grows

2012
01:26:11,260 --> 01:26:14,080
Everyone doesn't even know where it is

2013
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,620
so i can come up with a solution

2014
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:17,660
So I think the point now is to

2015
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:21,000
I face it when I can make it public

2016
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,800
then we can make it better

2017
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,340
that's what we're talking about risk management

2018
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,620
Thanks

2019
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,920
Okay, thank you

2020
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,760
ok let's see if there is any more

2021
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,060
this gentleman

2022
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,140
Hello Mr. Ma

2023
01:26:38,140 --> 01:26:43,000
I know this plan is his from the 2018 earthquake

2024
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,040
start after the shock

2025
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,840
to explore

2026
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:51,440
In fact, speaking from the public's point of view, it means that everyone

2027
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:55,540
An earthquake in the southern part of Canada will be like destroying the city of Liujia

2028
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:56,820
Central axis structure

2029
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:57,580
this kind

2030
01:26:57,580 --> 01:27:00,140
He will also be me in the next fifty years

2031
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I refer to Mr. Ma's information

2032
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,760
His chances are very high

2033
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,760
Will you talk about this plan in the future?

2034
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,260
The faults that will be transferred to other places to make carbon bricks

2035
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,260
For example, put fiber optic bricks into the hexagonal fault

2036
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,760
Thanks

2037
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,760
I think so, but it's a big challenge

2038
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,760
When I published

2039
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,760
when i publish

2040
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,960
middle school teacher said

2041
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,960
Ma, when are you coming to Jiayi?

2042
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,960
this

2043
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,960
This Labr has a lot

2044
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,960
but it's really my idea

2045
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,960
Even we originally hoped to go to the Meishan fault

2046
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,960
Where is the Meishan fault?

2047
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,960
Actually it's still not clear where it is

2048
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,960
someone said

2049
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,960
Did it go into the mountain or not?

2050
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,960
The Tainan Earthquake of 1852 on the Hexagonal Fault

2051
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,960
It may be related to the hexagonal fault

2052
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:48,960
150 years now

2053
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,960
next to it is chinese reservoir

2054
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,960
so in fact it does

2055
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,960
this is a start

2056
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,960
we hope for the future

2057
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,960
don't even need us to show

2058
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,960
Using Chunghwa Telecom's signal

2059
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,940
way to understand where his fault might be

2060
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,440
but i have to buy the ambassador

2061
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,140
the ambassador itself is expensive

2062
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,800
Thank you for your support

2063
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,140
The ambassador wants 7 million to 10 million

2064
01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:11,600
but it is potable

2065
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,140
That means I can spend two months here today

2066
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:16,240
Then go to another place for two months

2067
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,340
that this is now

2068
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:19,700
but we currently feel

2069
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:23,100
Because ambassadors are becoming more and more commercially competitive

2070
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,300
So the price goes down every year

2071
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,300
because everyone knows

2072
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,300
After it is very important, many manufacturers have begun to appear

2073
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,200
So maybe there's a chance in the future

2074
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,860
Can be more decoration

2075
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:34,860
Thanks

2076
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,360
Okay, thank you

2077
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,400
we have no other

2078
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,200
Casual good

2079
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:42,400
this one is behind

2080
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,900
please turn on the microphone

2081
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:48,960
Mr. Man, I have no problem.

2082
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,660
but i want to say thank you

2083
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,860
feel so hard

2084
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:55,900
I just stopped all the way feeling sad

2085
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:56,960
that is

2086
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,160
Thank you

2087
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,960
is what we do

2088
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
But I do have a doubt

2089
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
because we're an earthquake nation

2090
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,000
why are you doing this part of the research

2091
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
He is a great contribution to the country

2092
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
But why so little money

2093
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I just feel sad the more I listen to it

2094
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
but i want to say

2095
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
say thank you

2096
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Thank you

2097
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Thank you for your recognition

2098
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
try to

2099
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
It's okay

2100
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
At least the hospital has supported us in this project

2101
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
The matter of large-scale earthquakes

2102
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
In fact, I have been talking for more than ten years

2103
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,000
At that time, the vice president just mentioned

2104
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
sort of telling a story

2105
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
But the vice president mentioned that

2106
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I started TEM Taiwan Earthquake Past Life

2107
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I'm actually in the hospital

2108
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,000
we will write a white paper

2109
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
At that time, Academician Liu Jiahan wrote a white paper

2110
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
You have to turn against the talent of engineering

2111
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
engineering say

2112
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
A certain teacher, you get out the money map

2113
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
No one dares to invest in Taiwan

2114
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
because the money is so high

2115
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,240
Then why do California and Japan have solutions?

2116
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,920
yes we don't hide the problem

2117
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,720
It's about what kind of situation we're facing

2118
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:08,840
The results of it

2119
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,680
The one really interested in that graph is TSMC

2120
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:13,520
So after the Tainan earthquake

2121
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,120
TSMC came to us and said

2122
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,280
Teacher Ma, I completely follow the government's regulations

2123
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,840
Why the Beauty Earthquake

2124
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,360
My plant has suffered so much damage

2125
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:26,800
He started asking us to do a series of calculations

2126
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,560
then to massive earthquakes

2127
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,720
Start working with the hospital

2128
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:34,280
So I think also those conversations are formative

2129
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,040
Then from a scientific point of view

2130
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,560
is when we are ready

2131
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,640
he can play when he can play

2132
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,000
Just like a tsunami

2133
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,760
My doctoral dissertation is doing tsunami

2134
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,480
My first plan is to do a tsunami in Taiwan

2135
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,920
At the time, the National Science and Technology Council of the Ministry of Science and Technology said

2136
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:48,840
There is no tsunami in Taiwan, why do you make a tsunami?

2137
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:51,360
After the Great Sumen Earthquake in 2004

2138
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,520
He said Mr. Ma, you can do the math

2139
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:54,480
Tsunami potential map for the whole of Taiwan

2140
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,560
Then it will be completed within three months

2141
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,120
Of course we must also do it well

2142
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,000
So I guess it's

2143
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,800
That's the science, we're ready

2144
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:05,200
When the country needs it, we want a chance to be seen

2145
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:11,200
Okay lady please turn on the microphone

2146
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
thanks thanks

2147
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
thank you thank you

2148
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Thank you maybe in China hope you can accept

2149
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
ok lady please

2150
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Hello, Mr. Mai, I would like to ask for advice, because I am studying architecture myself.

2151
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I don't want to say this is from the National Earthquake Research Center

2152
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Because in fact there is a that in Jingmei

2153
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
The earthquake of the one-to-one model The earthquake of the structure

2154
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,540
the demonstration center

2155
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,840
Then I also took students to see

2156
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,540
I want to say that the Construction Department of the Ministry of the Interior

2157
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:07,940
I don't know that there is cooperation with the teacher

2158
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:10,600
Because I think many people don’t know it’s because

2159
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,840
Say I buy a house

2160
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,940
Are there any fault zones near Arbor

2161
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:15,640
Then I'm breaking above and below

2162
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:16,780
Just the teacher mentioned

2163
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:19,240
what is his influence on my future

2164
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:20,640
Especially in Taipei

2165
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,140
In fact, the commentary we just watched

2166
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,680
Only then did I know that the spray ground has a kind of

2167
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,380
It is the effect of the microwave is returning

2168
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:28,540
In fact, near the 101

2169
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:30,180
There is also a fault zone

2170
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,480
so i've been talking to you

2171
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,340
For example, our sprayed ground is a mud station

2172
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,340
Silt formation

2173
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,040
and build a house on it

2174
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,980
The assumption is that this can be molded

2175
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:41,880
Is it possible that it's on the ACD's side?

2176
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,680
When the builder develops

2177
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,080
Just ask him to cooperate with this academic research

2178
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,180
He can buy an optical fiber to go down

2179
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:50,180
Well, in fact, the feedback information

2180
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:51,640
volume will be more

2181
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:53,380
This is my question above

2182
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:54,180
Thanks

2183
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:55,340
yes thank you

2184
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:56,080
I think so

2185
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,940
but in actuality

2186
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,340
been challenged a lot

2187
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,760
So I just mentioned that building codes actually

2188
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,620
Sometimes you may see some of my essays in the media

2189
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:09,520
They mentioned that this affects investment

2190
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,340
impact real estate

2191
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:12,960
At that time I remember when I wrote an article

2192
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,620
Tell me, Mr. Ma, you will affect real estate

2193
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:18,940
So I said affecting real estate is something I have to worry about?

2194
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:20,360
that's not my business

2195
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:24,560
OK, what I want to do is to tell everyone what happened

2196
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,140
So back to what we just said about the CSA

2197
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,240
or the National Earthquake Engineering Center

2198
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,240
Then we probably have a lot of conversations.

2199
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,460
So the National Electrotechnical Center it has the shakers now

2200
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:36,340
or Construction Department

2201
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:38,980
I just mentioned that earthquake-resistant reinforcements have started to be planned

2202
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:42,940
At that time, the vice president and I were committee members of some projects.

2203
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:46,740
It's the directors of the State Council, etc.

2204
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:48,180
we'll mention that

2205
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:50,060
how do you make information public

2206
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:52,900
or your seismic specification

2207
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,840
Why did you spend 3 billion for example on the Menon earthquake

2208
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,180
I spent 3 billion to tell everyone to apply.

2209
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:00,200
I can help you with free insights

2210
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,400
no one applied

2211
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,560
There must be something wrong with the dialogue

2212
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,160
then i think step by step

2213
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:08,160
The real ideal, of course I hope

2214
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,260
I'm working with another project

2215
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,640
That is, I hope to place instruments in each Builder

2216
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,540
So back to what was just mentioned

2217
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,940
If I want to use the Taipei Basin

2218
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,640
If all the signals are analyzed clearly

2219
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,040
If I am in every

2220
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,040
Seismographs are placed in every house

2221
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:25,380
The current price of the seismograph itself is actually

2222
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:27,920
Let me cooperate with Teacher Liang's team

2223
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,440
is very cheap

2224
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,880
So we can use smart things

2225
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,980
send the signal to the user

2226
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:38,720
that also builds my database

2227
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,640
As my database becomes clearer

2228
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,180
The faults in each place are enlarged and reduced

2229
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,920
It has a big data to do

2230
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,680
But what about building data

2231
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,240
no one wants to help you

2232
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,680
willing to disclose

2233
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:53,420
So we now put instruments on it

2234
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:54,160
but that's

2235
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:54,980
I can let you swing

2236
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,740
but you can't make it public

2237
01:34:56,740 --> 01:34:57,960
This is also understandable

2238
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,460
so we are now

2239
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,460
The other will be with the United States and Japan

2240
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:03,060
That is to say, we are going to write a white paper on

2241
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:05,040
because the whole world is in the same situation

2242
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,840
Then I know that the United States and Japan already have laws and regulations

2243
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,140
Your building is more or less new, you definitely need a seismograph

2244
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:14,440
But he didn't say to analyze the seismograph

2245
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,640
that's a challenge

2246
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,040
If you want to analyze it, you may not have to disclose it to everyone.

2247
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,640
OK so when we mentioned

2248
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:23,340
Then I'll be linked to earthquake insurance.

2249
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:25,120
if you have a pendulum

2250
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:27,880
Can you lower the earthquake insurance, etc.

2251
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:31,160
Therefore, many ideals and legal aspects are carried out.

2252
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,480
I also learned a lot

2253
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,520
But scientifically, I think it can be done

2254
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,960
Then the only way we can talk now is through the public sector

2255
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,280
If he is willing to help us

2256
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,360
like this thank you

2257
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,480
ok, this one is at the end

2258
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,960
our last question

2259
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,320
Hello, Mr. Ma, I am here today because of the famous name.

2260
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,560
then your speech was really wonderful

2261
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:53,360
Although I am a layman in earthquakes

2262
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,460
But it's also delicious

2263
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,820
Then I have a question about

2264
01:35:56,820 --> 01:36:00,120
Muming just talked about the glamorous generation. This technology is not only

2265
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,360
can be used to understand faults in Taiwan

2266
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,200
It can also be used for forward-looking energy planning now

2267
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:09,300
Technological breakthroughs in geothermal and carbon sequestration

2268
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,500
you can specifically say

2269
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:12,800
This kind of light is inside the ground

2270
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,400
How can we help us break through

2271
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,360
Now look forward to these energy

2272
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:18,240
Used to go in and stop the geothermal

2273
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,240
Then I think this pit is really big

2274
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,960
there are many problems to be solved

2275
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,060
Then can you be more specific?

2276
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:26,100
How can this thing help this

2277
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:27,640
Underground exploration

2278
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:28,840
ok yes thank you

2279
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,940
I just mentioned Dust

2280
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,700
In fact, when we put the light in

2281
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:34,440
You can also measure the temperature directly

2282
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,440
So now of course I just said it was Dust's instrument

2283
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,740
I still have a DTS instrument now

2284
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:41,300
I can directly measure how the temperature changes

2285
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:43,140
Then my job now is to see

2286
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,800
How temperature and water affect each other

2287
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,440
Then if the geothermal temperature

2288
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,600
but the important part

2289
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:52,500
Then if you are EGS

2290
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,600
That is, after you want to pour water down

2291
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:55,700
Bring the temperature up again

2292
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,940
You need to know how your water flows

2293
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,500
Although your light if

2294
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,200
because of you

2295
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,740
This company is only a receiver

2296
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:04,860
So what do you get from these receivers and the government size of his vibration

2297
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:08,460
You can't comment on how big the water flow is

2298
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,620
and what is his direction

2299
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,920
It is specific to the direction of his entire SCPG

2300
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:14,980
direction of water flow

2301
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:16,380
But it's ideal

2302
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:19,660
This is to say that his possible application of the above work

2303
01:37:19,660 --> 01:37:22,700
If it is carbon dioxide madness

2304
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:25,580
But now the situation is that he may have another earthquake

2305
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:28,920
Previously, the Environmental Protection Agency was mentioning these tasks

2306
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:31,600
If I want to know that there will be another earthquake today

2307
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,360
How old will he be?

2308
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,800
I can actually get in with a fiber optic signal

2309
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:37,800
I do realtime monitoring

2310
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,360
I only want

2311
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:44,280
Because of the crazy storage of carbon dioxide, it must be pressurized into my neck.

2312
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,920
Because when I'm under pressure

2313
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,920
possible recurrent cracks

2314
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,820
So I made the crack from again

2315
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:52,640
I can figure out what the size of this earthquake is

2316
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,520
so i can know right away

2317
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:58,200
If my earthquake reoccurs

2318
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,040
much more than before

2319
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,560
That is when the V value of the GRL increases

2320
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,200
I can give direct Shutdown signal

2321
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,120
So our current concept is red and green

2322
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:09,620
The concept of red, yellow and green lights

2323
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:12,920
Should be green light yellow light red light concept

2324
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,820
that's if you've been pressurizing today

2325
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:17,720
Your seismic activity is not particularly high

2326
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,320
Because Real Time has been on Monitor

2327
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:22,320
So the rep said you can keep doing carbon dioxide sequestration

2328
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,000
But when you get stressed enough

2329
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,800
Your little earthquake signal is getting more and more

2330
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,920
The representative said that your earthquake has been disturbed by you

2331
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,260
you may want to stress lower

2332
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,420
reduce the pressure to a certain extent

2333
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:36,020
So that's the yellow light

2334
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:39,060
Then if its scale jumps from 3 to 4

2335
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:40,220
Of course it is Shutdown

2336
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:42,120
It's you that turns into a red light

2337
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,820
That Shutdown does not mean that you will never be able to use it

2338
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,720
that's what we're talking about

2339
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:50,500
Like the Shutdown situation caused by the earthquake in Oklahoma

2340
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,260
We mean after you Shutdown

2341
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:54,320
How long can you recover

2342
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,720
Well, this is my other idea, of course.

2343
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,280
For example, the scale of the earthquake is the scale

2344
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Scale five it's probably up to magnitude five there might be some damage

2345
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,600
That can also incorporate the concept of earthquake insurance.

2346
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,800
Or the manufacturers of these energy sources

2347
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,000
It first places within a radius of 30 kilometers

2348
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,600
Generally speaking, the impact of Scale 4 and Scale 5 is within 30 kilometers

2349
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:18,300
The house is made of earthquake-resistant reinforcements to a standard earthquake intensity of five or more

2350
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:21,100
