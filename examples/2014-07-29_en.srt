1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,360
Climb, UK.

2
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:42,940
you.

3
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:52,520
Can you can provide

4
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:01,460
how about you?

5
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,340
find your treatment.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,260
this knowledge test

7
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,900
Then we invite people from this information office today

8
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,120
around red garden

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,720
Distinguished Researcher

10
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,560
explain to us

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,420
he is

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,600
The Second Decade of Academia Sinica

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,860
Multimedia Studies and Digital Archiving

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
then i want this

15
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,960
After I saw this topic

16
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
I said he must be ten years

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,460
Almost ten years ago he gave

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,860
a similar speech

19
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,960
I didn't have the honor of hearing his first speech

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,460
but i'm looking forward to this

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,460
this

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,960
we know this recently this

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
this twenty or thirty years

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
perhaps

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,460
Anyone would think that saying this is

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,960
knowledge explosion

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,460
we use this

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,760
media

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,060
Or use this power

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
benefit from this consultation

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,800
then you can be anywhere

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,200
as long as you have internet

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
You can probably find what you want to know

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
So today we are looking forward to this talk

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
also hope

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,400
Researcher Yaoyao especially wants to explain to us

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,900
That is to say, it's not uncommon for you to find such advice.

38
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,400
Then he will ask for the old consultation that is no longer available

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
fix it again

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,900
We commonly call it to explain the resurrection

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,600
and this thing

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,500
Whether it is this image

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
or video

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,800
see him later

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,900
then let me make a brief introduction

46
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,200
Dr. Naruo is his student

47
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
He is powerless Tsinghua University

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
1981 Physics Series

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then 90 years at Northwestern University

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Northwestern University received a Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical Engineering

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Then come back in 91

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come to our hospital to serve

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So it is probably the same from 1991 to now

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
20 years

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that's in the middle

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He also served as the Deputy Director of the Information Office

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And also our India Branch

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It is now called Indo Center

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Formerly known as the Institute of Indian Technology and Engineering

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Acting Director of the Preparatory Office

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Also worked as the director of the computer center

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In addition to being in this hospital, he is currently

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In addition to the special researcher of the Information Office of the Institute

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He is also in the Engineering Department of Jiaotong University

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Chengda Electrical Engineering Department

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Professor of Peace

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Also from Chung Yuan University

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
be a professor

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,840
Of course, in China for more than 20 years

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,340
numerous awards

71
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,340
all important awards

72
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,840
he got it all

73
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,340
Young Assistant Award from the Central Hospital

74
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
this one is for young people

75
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,140
Speaking of young people

76
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,140
This is the highest honor in the country

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,140
National Science Council Distinguished Award

78
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
three times

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,640
Then National Invention and Creation Award

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,640
There is also the rooting plan of the Central Academy of Fine Arts

81
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
This is our Central Academy

82
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,640
forward-looking rooting

83
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
with the theme plan

84
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
these are encouragements

85
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,640
someone who does research well

86
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Internationally

87
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
he too

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
unmoving fellow

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
in service work

90
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
he also does a lot

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Domestic and international conferences

92
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,040
He also made many arrangements and agreements

93
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,400
I think I won't waste any time today

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,440
then we are very much looking forward to hearing

95
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,440
We want a special fellow to give us a great talk

96
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,440
The editor-in-chief thank you, Dean Wang, for the introduction

97
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,900
last time i said

98
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,900
In fact, it is about February 22, 2006

99
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,900
That's the private flight 222

100
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,400
I was going to say 10 years

101
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Because I was also working on the agreement article before

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,900
Say I hope 10 years from now

103
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,900
Because of the research we comprehend

104
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,900
You have been working for 10 years and can only speak for an hour and a half

105
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,400
because I can't speak math

106
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,900
can't talk about everything else

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
So not only can I edit that picture for you to see

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,860
So the 10-year thing will be about an hour and a half

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you retire in 2024

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,340
probably my whole life research

111
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,840
Can speak for four and a half hours

112
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,960
I did the math

113
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,800
four and a half hours

114
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,780
wait a minute listen

115
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,280
why can only talk for an hour and a half

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
then let me talk briefly

117
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Today I talk about this topic

118
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,480
I suggest the second decade

119
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
The second decade is there for a reason

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
I am in 1998

121
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,480
At that time, there was a plan to start digital singing

122
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,980
That's a national industry

123
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
it hadn't started yet

124
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,480
At that time it was a pilot project

125
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Maybe it's a little simpler like me

126
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Then I want to talk about this topic and the Internet

127
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
is related

128
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Internet circa 1993

129
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,480
At that time began to be developed

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,480
So in 1995 and 1996

131
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
I felt at that time that for us

132
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
For people of our time

133
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
was a big shock

134
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,480
That is to say, when I was studying, I was 19...

135
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
University is 1970

136
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Graduated in 1980 and 1981

137
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
That 83 823

138
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
When I went to study in the United States in 1983

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When I went to Wang Kruyman

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In fact, Batch is still used in many cases

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's the one that stacks the box with dirt

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
level

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then the main fear

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They're all going to be messed up

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
sometimes get it wrong

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
will do it again

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So we were not the same back then

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, the Internet was actually in 1993

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since then it has flourished

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
that 1996

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In 1996

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
we can use the Internet

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to the floating museum in france

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to see their painting

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's a digital painting

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
can go to browse

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
At that time, for people of our generation

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
People who have always been the information

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
was a big shock

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
more shocking things

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
actually another thing

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that is

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
At that time, we in the East actually did not

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
make good use of the internet

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So in fact culture

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
In terms of culture

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is a hassle

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
why

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Because we all only look at western culture

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But our oriental things

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
we didn't build it

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
no words for him to type

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
so then

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
i'm guessing

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If we hadn't started doing it then

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
20 years later we are all

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,500
In fact, culture is taken away by metaphors signed by the West

178
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,300
because they have cultural connotations

179
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,400
They can come and affect our whole youth

180
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,800
these new generations

181
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,500
like japanese manga

182
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
affecting our children

183
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,900
has a deep influence

184
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,600
is the same reason

185
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,700
So starting in 1998

186
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,900
In Taiwan, we started to do some Internet

187
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,800
right

188
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,100
I just want to lose it

189
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,000
At that time there were several lead-type intensifications

190
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
good

191
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
back then in 1998

192
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,700
There are three Pilot Projects

193
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Pilot Project is pilot intensification

194
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,400
One is the International Digital Library Corporation Plan

195
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
it was 2001

196
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,600
The seventh year's mission project was in 1998

197
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,800
But since 1998, it has been investing in

198
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,900
At that time there was National Archive Digitalization Program

199
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,400
2001

200
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
make a pilot plan

201
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,400
if our career loses it

202
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,100
hope that these cultural connotations

203
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I hope that these cultural connotations will start

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
on our inner east side

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's Taiwan that constructed some cultural connotations for him

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Then there is a problem

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we took some money

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's finally one of them

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
National Taiwan University too

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
At that time, a host said

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
let's not happen technology now

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We just have to let him go up

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's good to be able to use it

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's good to be able to see

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that's not for me

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
i can't do this

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
when i first started

218
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I feel like saying

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
if you're going to do this with me

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Then take my postdoc

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
or my PhD students

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Although you give me money

223
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But from the point of view of our field of information

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If I want to do RMD

225
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If I just do some service

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
do some digitalization

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
a sacrifice for my students

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the other side is unfair

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because our Chinese medicine hospital must have research

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
there is a laboratory

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then we're doing this

232
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If it is simply input

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
very unfair to students

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So we insisted

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't care what he says

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm doing research anyway

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's okay if you can't do it

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Then we were in 2001

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,660
There has been a first episode since 2002

240
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,620
called

241
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,700
Your permission to use the Digital Archive Program

242
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,960
the MDAP

243
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,160
That was from 2002 to 2006

244
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,820
At that time, I was developing technology very quickly.

245
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,700
At that time including Kiwi Jiufu watermark

246
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,200
include this

247
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,700
DESOLATED DETECTION

248
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,320
those i did some of that

249
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,860
The news bureau uses the automatic technology of the storyboard

250
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,260
THAT DOES MATTA DATA

251
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,760
did something at that time

252
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Then in 2006

253
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,660
This is the RMD of NID

254
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,340
No one wants to be an RMD host

255
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Because when the PI of RMD

256
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,640
it's tiring to report

257
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,540
i can't take some money

258
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,140
research i like to do

259
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,540
As long as it's related to the plan

260
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,400
that 2006

261
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,900
that time

262
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,560
At that time, the host Jian Lifeng

263
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,360
Dr. Jane

264
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,040
he later begged

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,960
Hired by Google as general manager

266
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,700
That

267
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,240
at that time

268
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,800
Mead Choi

269
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,300
you know

270
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,960
Now President of Zhouding University

271
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,360
he lied to me

272
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,500
not far

273
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,300
you are the director of the computing center

274
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,500
your computing center

275
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,140
There are more than a dozen people who take this

276
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,740
plan money

277
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,040
you act temporarily

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I will be silly, because I didn't think too much, just say yes

279
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Take it, take it and you won't be able to throw it away

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
By the end of December 2012, I have been the P.I of RMD

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
At that time, in 2007, the second five-year intensification of the digital arena will begin

282
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But at that time the National Science Council would have a

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
On the contrary, it is said that there was a digital learning national program at the Central University at that time

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It is very strange that you want to do rituals but not study

285
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So the National Science Council insists that the two plans should be merged together

286
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So in 2007, 2005 and 2008 to 2012, the name of the second phase was changed

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It is called Mational Taiwan Etonian Digital Archive Program

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
TLDAP for short

289
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Then I will still be the P.I of this RMD

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Invote at that time, many people, many people now

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,220
Let me tell you about this sharing of R&D

292
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,900
It was the share I hosted

293
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,600
The annual gold fee is 140 million

294
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,100
When you get that much money your hands shake

295
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,100
especially when signing a contract

296
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,500
in fact when signing

297
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Sometimes I have to ask if I will be arrested and imprisoned.

298
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,900
Of course this congress will put 100 million of it in it

299
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,700
is to build a homework team for digital learning that year build a team

300
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,900
In fact, only 30 to 40 million can be used to do R&D together

301
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,300
Of course there are a few eight to share

302
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,600
The first share is that we can expand the content

303
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
The second share is for R&D

304
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,700
The third sharing is digital, these platforms are platform

305
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,100
make a union directory

306
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,500
This place is very important

307
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,200
There are many institutions involved

308
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,500
have included the Ministry of Education

309
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Including National Taiwan University

310
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,700
including history museum

311
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Gu Guangde College

312
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,300
Including Central University

313
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,100
including Tsinghua University

314
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,500
Including National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, etc. have participated

315
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
Basically these people

316
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,400
These institutions are basically

317
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
provider of digital content

318
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The content provider

319
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In particular, there are a lot of sayings in Chinese and English

320
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The timekeeping station or various

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
they have a lot of literature

322
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
so what i'm gonna say

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's basically a comment provider

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
then come again

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
We also have a total request for proposal

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
for example

327
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
quarter university has some

328
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
back then

329
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
music department has many

330
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The great musicians of all ages in Taiwan

331
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
For example, Jiang Wen and so on

332
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
they have some

333
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There are some sound content and their manuscripts

334
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
so let's talk about it

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
it doesn't matter the sound or the music

336
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So the manuscript has a lot of content

337
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
but you all know

338
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
These things are actually

339
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It is rendered in domainty way

340
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That is to say, its content has sound

341
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
with video

342
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
have text file

343
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and video files

344
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Video files are the most troublesome

345
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There are many issues involved

346
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
For example, video has a very large amount of data

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because the video it's kind of like a cartoon

348
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
it wants to fragment your visual comrades

349
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
so it stipulates

350
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,820
More than 24 cards are required, it will fool you with more than forty strategies

351
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,720
So European specifications are different from US specifications.

352
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,520
One is 25 sheets and the other is 30 sheets, one second

353
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,680
When there are 25 or 30 images per second

354
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,520
The data of four sheets is very large.

355
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,360
Then we knew that we were going to digitize a lot of old videos, old photos

356
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,280
Then these things will be digitized and put in the database

357
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,560
To texture nearby is to spend a little labor

358
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,400
But what to do next

359
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,600
The quick way, the self-styled way to find what you want

360
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,920
that self-proclaimed method

361
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,040
We all know libraries, when we're looking for books

362
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,400
You gotta know Bosser's name best, don't you?

363
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,000
then what is its title

364
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,600
So when you go to search, the book will be quickly available

365
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
Then we will suggest a multimedia database

366
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,960
Including movies, digital movies

367
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:52,000
Including sound, including video, including old photos, digitization

368
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,880
You have to search for these things, how to search

369
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,080
This question is what our RMD sharing said to do

370
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,000
let's do a

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,820
able to address these complex, say video

372
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,520
able to do compression

373
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,000
Compression is a big problem, why?

374
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,720
Because you use a lot of video now

375
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,160
That's because it's huge, so we have to do compression

376
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,720
Now the more commonly used compression may be

377
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,520
Previously MPEG MPEG 1 2

378
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,000
1 MPEG 1 VCD MPEG 2 VVD MPEG 4

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,560
Then change to H.264 next

380
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,760
If I say I use a little standard

381
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,760
But let me tell you that MPEG and H.264 are different specifications

382
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,360
MPEG it uses DCT 4 8x8 block

383
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,480
A block to lead me to code

384
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,160
H.264 uses four-layer

385
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,960
So there's a lot of engineering in between

386
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,920
If at the beginning, now I save it in MPEG

387
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,960
Compressed, I passed 20 years later

388
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,160
After a few years it became H.264

389
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
That's the middle shift. How to shift?

390
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,720
this is all issue

391
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,280
Both are research issues

392
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,120
Then it's how we go to fast

393
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,040
able to do with these large amounts of data

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Notes Search

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
These are some e-sion

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
it's all we have to deal with

397
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So I don't want to say

398
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
just do it

399
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
supplementary work

400
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
because you have to get these things done

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Only then can we compare with the world

402
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
so this is

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
At that time we insisted

404
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
must do research

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
a very important reason

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's what we built again

407
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
a theme

408
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This is Poto

409
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then what I'm going to say next is

410
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The first topic is imaging pending

411
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
imaging pending

412
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This is called the creation number

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
image creation

414
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's because Liao Hongyuan

415
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
then a few digits long

416
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you want to change history?

417
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
you want image creation

418
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you want to remove Mao Zedong?

419
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Or put Chiang Kai-shek in it

420
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Anyway it is

421
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
what do you want to change

422
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's not like that

423
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The purpose of innovation is to

424
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
everyone knows

425
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You Leonardo acted in a movie

426
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
called ghost certification

427
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Inside the certification of ghosts and ghosts

428
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
you Leonardo

429
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He is a top player in the world

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Innovation Check

431
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
just change the check

432
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He was later caught by the FBI

433
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
that is also that him

434
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,860
He was a Wuhan guest and an FBI agent

435
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,200
Later this Ninaide

436
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,140
later worked for the FBI

437
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,800
Because as long as you have a five-photo profile

438
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,100
He knew at a glance whether this house would

439
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,940
this is fake

440
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,440
because he uses something

441
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,560
you take your fake stuff

442
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
he will know

443
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,100
So in fact the highest master

444
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,360
He must learn how to steal

445
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,200
He will know how to take pictures

446
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,440
So we have to start with the string change number

447
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
How to change the number of strings

448
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,700
Make string changes in a photo

449
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,800
let me show you this photo

450
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,460
This picture is my student

451
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,860
It's a doctoral class at Jiaotong University

452
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,260
is working now

453
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,400
He went to Egypt in 2009

454
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,260
an international conference meeting

455
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,600
They opened an art gallery to see this

456
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,900
my student

457
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,760
He is a Boban student

458
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,100
Students from SJTU

459
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,160
This is the beautiful professor of Qing University

460
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,260
Professor Xu Qiulin

461
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,760
At that time, he took a picture from the side

462
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,160
Then Teacher Xu will come back

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,900
According to this one, wow this one is really correct

464
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,600
But the place where we take the high light is who is behind it?

465
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,240
This is Huang Zhonglin from Qingla Electrical Engineering Department

466
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,360
He just stood there looking bored

467
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,840
So he Xu Congming said over there

468
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,760
Then can you please get rid of him?

469
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,500
I get rid of him

470
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,440
Removing it is visually there is nothing there

471
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,360
this is tampering

472
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,500
This is tampering

473
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Last time Shao Guangzhao was the senior, former director Shao Guangzhao

474
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,300
He took a photo for me

475
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,000
He said whether to be as good as you

476
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,800
did you do this

477
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
you have a photo

478
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,200
there are four people on it

479
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,500
can you remove one of them

480
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,800
take the other three and bring them all closer together

481
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,300
Because he said because the photo was a journal guest

482
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,700
Gest Editor has three of the four in it

483
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,000
He expects them to just delete that footage with

484
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,600
Take a picture in mainland

485
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,900
tell me to take one of them off

486
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The other three can all be together

487
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,500
I'll take it back then

488
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Just follow my Post-art

489
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
they're doing that mic

490
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,000
He's the doctor who plays and plays

491
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
say hey come come

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
you help him

493
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
fix it

494
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
Then he said teacher

495
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
You tell him how you can call us like that

496
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Those four people were all put on it.

497
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,000
understood

498
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
that photo is fake

499
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
right

500
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
just go to the newspaper

501
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
As a result, the mainland said

502
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
very powerful

503
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Our Taiwanese children are good

504
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,000
good

505
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Then do such a photo to do

506
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
when buying photos

507
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Usually the old photos he sends are yellower

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So the first thing we have to deal with is brightness

509
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
so we have to find a way

510
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Take yellow photos

511
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
become like this

512
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,500
the wrinkled part of you

513
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
no way

514
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
why would the photo

515
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
will change color or

516
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
wrinkled

517
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
the reason is because we

518
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Many times we used to be early

519
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It was taken with negatives

520
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
100 or 400 exposures

521
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Then there are 24 or 36 discs like that

522
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
so take that glue dot

523
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to wash out the photo

524
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
put on ass face

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
after a long time

526
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm blocking you, after a long time you can use the inch white tree to help me remove it

527
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That, maybe, maybe, that after a long time

528
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He will sometimes have a tree crushing him, he will have wrinkles

529
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
My wrinkles will produce something like this, of course the color will change after a long time

530
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So how do we think of a way to bring him back to his color

531
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The second one removes his wrinkles and does it automatically

532
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's the archives office, back then we had a lot of these things in the archives office

533
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We need to deal with some old photos, but we want to be lazy

534
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Because we don’t want to talk about the Archives Bureau, we will just say it, because at that time all the photos of the items here will be given to you, please help us get them

535
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Our best approach is to ask people, because that is to say try to develop some albums

536
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Let people who can't even use computers can use it, but we are lazy

537
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Then we have to be smart to be lazy, so we have to make some automatic tools for them to use

538
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This technology was transferred to the International in November 2010

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,580
The National Archives, wait a minute, has a video doctored book.

540
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,000
was calculated to the National Archives in December 2011

541
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,500
It took us a year and a half to make this interface

542
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,700
let them use

543
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,580
ok, this is this part

544
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,080
Then you will ask me what the hell is this doing?

545
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,700
it's math math this

546
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,200
For parts of this photo we used someone else's stuff

547
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,580
because someone else has done it

548
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,420
Let me introduce the colored part first

549
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,000
In fact, it was said that the photo was destroyed.

550
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Like the white part is destroyed

551
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,000
The part with the color on it is good

552
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,720
These two maths are to tell you

553
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,620
that is

554
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,620
This is a called confidential data control

555
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,720
These two look complicated

556
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,620
ignore them

557
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,720
what is he talking about

558
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,560
that is

559
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,420
Photos from this nice side

560
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,520
We hope to use good data to slowly simulate here

561
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,460
Use good to influence to guess

562
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,060
What should be the bad place

563
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,120
diffusion

564
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
then here is a line

565
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Red Curve

566
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
it

567
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,420
In fact, using the block of this road

568
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,420
just along this line

569
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This customer is not loyal

570
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,240
Where should the customer want this width?

571
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
start tinkering

572
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,920
tell a story

573
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,540
this is too difficult

574
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,420
i tell a story

575
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,920
I said why only 15 years

576
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,620
The reason why 10 years of things can only be talked about for a minute and a half

577
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,960
because i tell stories

578
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,040
there is an old lady

579
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,540
he made taipei

580
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,880
Then he was a little demented

581
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,080
so he got lost one day

582
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,580
just run to the police station

583
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
the police asked him

584
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,420
old lady

585
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,420
What are the characteristics of your neighborhood?

586
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,380
I said

587
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,500
What

588
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,080
You'll cops all fall off the fish

589
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,740
There are 3,000 restaurants in Taipei since Holy Communion

590
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,080
He said

591
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,580
He said

592
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,640
there is one elsewhere

593
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,240
female wife

594
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,740
My policeman stood up slowly and said

595
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,340
He said

596
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,240
you will go far

597
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
He said

598
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,080
OK for you

599
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:41,740
for you

600
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,000
That's a pity for everyone

601
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,740
Because the whole of Taipei City

602
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,700
There may only be 30 such combinations

603
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,580
easy to find

604
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,620
but I shrink

605
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,740
how do i tell a story

606
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,620
these two things

607
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,840
i tell this story

608
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,740
i'll tell you

609
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,500
where do you start

610
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,620
Just find a place to do complicated

611
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,620
the most complicated place

612
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,500
The most informative place

613
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,320
when repairing here

614
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,680
It will generate the least error

615
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
That's because this kind of error is here once wrong

616
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,440
it goes somewhere else

617
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
will affect other places

618
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
So we want Aeropropagation

619
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,840
The less passing of this error the better

620
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
So let's find a

621
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,160
The most informative place

622
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,840
So it has a Conditon Stain Delta

623
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,440
Together it becomes a Priority Tent

624
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,240
it's easy

625
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,360
it's easy

626
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,680
that's what we're looking for

627
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,040
Then we will deal with this photo

628
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,560
用Conditon Stain Delta

629
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,880
that's the whole thing

630
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,800
Then what

631
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,960
we just surround

632
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,920
Put it together and let this

633
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,800
Miss and Mr. Archives

634
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,640
won't get better

635
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,440
These guys have a flower rope

636
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,400
it judges where

637
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,360
need to be changed

638
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,200
What places do not need to be changed

639
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,640
just tick

640
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,200
Tick ​​a tick

641
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Then the fabricator will do it for you

642
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,640
this is done

643
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,360
Of course there are still some disadvantages

644
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,880
Because some things are still not done right

645
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,040
But compared to this one

646
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,920
This one is a lot of people

647
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,080
good

648
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,720
this is about that

649
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,520
Sugui doll

650
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,200
So it's image tampering

651
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,600
I'm going to talk about video tampering next.

652
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,000
The reason for video tampering is the same as just now

653
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The reason for video tampering is because

654
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I have to tamper with it so I can fix it

655
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,300
So let me talk about tampering first

656
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,000
fix it later

657
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The tampering here is my postdoctoral fellow.

658
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
do this topic with me

659
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
he is

660
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
He's been working with me for a long time with a Ph.D.

661
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,500
Because the school he was born in is more famous

662
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
So he suffered a lot

663
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,000
but he did a good job of researching

664
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
That's exactly what happened

665
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
that is

666
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,200
if we do video

667
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,700
what are you going to do

668
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,000
usually

669
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,300
video i just said

670
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,700
he's a visual strategy that will fool you in a second

671
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,200
So he is twenty-five per second

672
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,100
or thirty sheets of speed

673
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,700
then in this situation

674
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,300
I'll pick the first one

675
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,100
here is a dog

676
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,300
I want to make this dog into this first picture

677
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
brush it up with a brush

678
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,700
Then the yarn that is surrounded on all sides

679
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,900
will gather inside

680
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
It's just that Emmy sister is very kind

681
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So find a way to trick your eyes

682
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Then you see things that don't seem to happen

683
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Then it will be automatic from the beginning to the end of this piece

684
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
it will remove the head

685
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Then this is probably like this

686
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
There are only so small words like this broken place

687
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's just use a simple Pixel Inc. Coca-Cola Circle

688
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
it's easy to do

689
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
this photo is so beautiful

690
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
This girl is also pretty

691
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Many boys have this problem

692
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I gave it to other girlfriends when I was young

693
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
how would you describe this photo

694
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But I don't want your wife to see this

695
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
If you take it off

696
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
After holding it off, it will be a black piece

697
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
it won't follow

698
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It won't be dug out and there will be a view behind it

699
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Will not

700
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So we're going to use this method

701
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
in all directions

702
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Use Patch for large blocks

703
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
make it up

704
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Then you four...

705
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
it doesn't have to be true

706
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
but you seem to think it's real

707
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Especially video is better

708
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Because of the video it has many

709
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It has a lot of consecutive pictures around the time

710
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
so you can borrow another one

711
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
other places

712
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
come fix it

713
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,100
So it's probably like this on the face

714
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,200
Then we'll just use this picture

715
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,700
remove everything

716
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,300
Do brightness first

717
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,700
movement on the time axis

718
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,700
let's try to find it

719
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,200
If it's broken, I'll fix it

720
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,700
Then after the time axis is processed,

721
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,900
I deal with space

722
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,300
Handle broken ones in each frame

723
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,200
patch it up

724
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,800
then we've done our job

725
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,900
Then this is Motion

726
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,800
Motion has two

727
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,900
One is Global Motion

728
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,100
There are two kinds of the same as wet

729
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,800
Damp has a cold exchange

730
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,300
a rhinitis exchange

731
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,200
I think it's advertised very, very sincerely

732
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,500
Why?

733
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,400
Because I will know rhinitis to eat?

734
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,500
There are two kinds of colds

735
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,600
one kind of communication

736
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
because its ad is honest

737
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,300
because I carry it all

738
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,200
so i get a cold

739
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,700
So I bought wet to eat

740
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,100
that usually makes sense

741
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,600
There are two kinds of sports

742
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,500
There are two types of movement in a VD

743
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,700
One is Global Motion

744
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,900
One is Low Commotion

745
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,600
Global Motion is Camera Inch

746
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,900
when you are using the mirror

747
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The whole inside is moving with the Keymark

748
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,440
So it's a Global Motion

749
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,440
Local Motion is what's inside is moving

750
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,840
We're going to sneak around something that moves inside.

751
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,440
Previously had to deal with Global Motion first

752
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,840
make it up later

753
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,920
Only to deal with Local Motion

754
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
this will be correct

755
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
ok , then it ' s

756
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,000
That's when we make up

757
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,960
Because we have the advantage that

758
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,280
because it's on the timeline

759
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,720
it takes 30 frames per second

760
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
So it can go back and forth to find

761
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,560
some lost some

762
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,200
something that wasn't there before

763
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,080
go back and forth to find

764
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
make it up

765
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,480
then again

766
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,400
if you can't find it

767
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,440
It has the advantage of saying

768
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
It turns out that there is no other place available

769
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
use it

770
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,160
what about the end

771
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,320
is the show result

772
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,640
this dog is innocent

773
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,480
But it's been shown many times

774
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
this dog

775
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,800
that dog

776
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,000
That

777
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,680
That

778
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,600
take a closer look everyone

779
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,880
did it really work

780
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,680
the dog is gone

781
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,520
Hey, you're still here

782
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,600
This is how the movie was shot

783
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Actually I told me you don't need to be afraid of ghosts

784
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
The ghost is actually what dad did

785
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
wait a minute there are more ghosts

786
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
look here

787
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This was seven or eighty years ago

788
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
when the national assembly is in session

789
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
4th Treat says

790
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Because the lady wants to parry the reporter

791
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So the National Assembly represents Mrs.

792
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
she just walked out

793
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I was trying to be a little bit of a prank

794
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because my wife is hard to read

795
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I was thinking how could she put

796
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
stuff it in take one out

797
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
my wife in her thirties

798
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But I was afraid she would hit me later

799
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
so take a look here

800
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There is a red line here

801
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Let her go past here

802
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
This is an old photo

803
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
here is the video

804
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
it was originally made of film

805
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So let's plasticize it now

806
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Then one can do something like this

807
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You have seen ghosts, right?

808
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
gone

809
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
right here

810
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And it's another time-space gate

811
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
In the past, I only saw shadows

812
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
then next

813
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We use a Person

814
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Farmering of Person Lang

815
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
just look at it this way

816
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Once it's fixed, it's done.

817
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
it becomes clear

818
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
so think about it

819
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Is it possible to wear white history

820
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It is possible to wear white history

821
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It is not difficult to wear white history

822
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
i can wear white

823
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I put the people inside

824
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
it all looks the same there

825
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
can take it off

826
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
but our purpose

827
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
not wearing white history

828
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's fixing an old movie that's broken

829
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
fix it next

830
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Here is Zeng Ying's old video

831
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
just nine seconds

832
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
here will be white

833
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
because the film was placed underground

834
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
it's been a long time

835
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
it's wet

836
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
so it's long

837
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Then we use steel rods like that

838
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
tamper number in turn

839
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Anyway, let's find a way to go

840
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
make it work

841
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
we can

842
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Of course not but white is very beautiful

843
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
but

844
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You can do better than the original repair

845
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Compare

846
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
is better than the original

847
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
There are a lot more

848
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
this time we compare

849
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:29,000
This is repair, it’s easy to say, it’s easy to say, we want to take this software directly to the National Party Bureau and tell those ladies and gentlemen that you can use this software to repair this thing, it’s impossible,

850
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So it took us a year and a half. It took Dr. Tan a year and a half. He made an interface. This was in 2012.

851
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,000
This video, this FRIENDS is to be repaired, the red part is to be painted with a brush, so this part is long, I want to brush it off,

852
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
The ten versions made by Dr. Tan, for example, the first version may use the previous timeline, and there are three previous versions.

853
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The second version is the last two, the third version is the first two,

854
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,900
Two pictures in the back, two pictures in the back, so there are ten versions, different versions

855
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,900
It takes different intervals to fix this one

856
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Then these versions are its different versions

857
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,900
So this gentleman or lady who restores old videos

858
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,900
She only needs to look at these ten versions and decide which one to look at

859
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
These seven hook up, and then replace this one

860
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,900
In this way, we can do this automatically and automatically

861
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,900
But it is much more convenient than before

862
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,900
In the past you had to fix this thing, especially if you were on a photo table

863
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,900
how does it fix this thing

864
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Of course it will make you prettier

865
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
I really can't make you beautiful

866
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,900
But at least some bad things can be put away

867
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
fix it as much as possible

868
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
it's automatic

869
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,900
what was just said

870
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,900
Here I go, doing such a boring thing

871
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,900
it can make a good push powder

872
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,900
is that you just put your heart on it and put it above the science

873
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,900
Heart to science, don't use borrowed material is bad

874
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,900
Because that thing is hard to push powder

875
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But I just want to think of a good topic

876
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
it's all above

877
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
can also be used in real applications

878
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
can really let go of anything

879
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
i would not sacrifice my students

880
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
My students have a future

881
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
i can't sacrifice them

882
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
But I want to do such a bad topic

883
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So I want a good science inside

884
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
What is Twitter doing here?

885
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
is done when there is an action

886
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Because what we've just talked about is background stuff.

887
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It is easy to make up for the background

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
because time goes by

889
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That background doesn't move very well

890
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But if foreground something

891
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
How do you move if you happen to be covered by the head of the sect?

892
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Let's say I'm walking halfway

893
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
something happened to be broken

894
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
There is an action in the middle

895
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
When six or seven cards are dropped

896
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
how do i fix it

897
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Human movement is a very complex movement

898
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because people are highly valued sports

899
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
that's worth it

900
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It is articulated motion

901
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
it will move a lot of joints

902
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You don't look like you move on you

903
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
just have a lot of joints

904
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Then this problem is a very complicated sports problem

905
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
so when it's walking

906
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
In fact, many places will move

907
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So how do I use a very short

908
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
very precise description

909
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
then pinch him in

910
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,500
that's a very difficult question

911
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Let's take an example of the simplest

912
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,700
He walked over from one of these two people

913
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,000
this is my student

914
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,100
one came over there

915
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,600
one walks over there

916
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,900
There is a rendezvous in the middle

917
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,400
what about this guy

918
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,200
can i take him off

919
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,600
let the one blocked

920
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,000
Walking from left to right without being blocked

921
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
can you

922
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That's the problem we're going to do

923
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,900
It's a matter of tenure

924
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,900
that's what i just said

925
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,500
when blocked

926
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,700
or a video somewhere

927
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,000
Where it moves, he is

928
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,500
It's not long, it's not broken

929
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,200
How can I get him back to school?

930
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,100
this problem

931
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,000
The previous problem is easier

932
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,700
because of the background

933
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,700
here is the foreground

934
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,600
The prospect is more difficult

935
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,000
good

936
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,300
Then of course we did a few moves

937
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,400
The first is to say

938
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,200
I put the complicated

939
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,400
my section

940
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,900
simply use some projection

941
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,500
divide it

942
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,200
Here are a few of the simplest things

943
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,900
My boys and classmates

944
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,200
Boy students speak

945
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,800
you have to listen to them

946
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,200
you see

947
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,700
This place is just pissed off

948
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,160
The place where the least movement is projected is the navel

949
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,820
So if your belly button is big, watch out

950
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,360
In fact, the amount of exercise is the smallest

951
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,160
Because we put the belly in different movements

952
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,420
After projecting it over

953
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,600
After Number 20, I found your place with the lowest amount of exercise

954
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,720
It's where the navel is

955
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,200
So we divide this person's body into the upper half and the lower half to describe

956
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,600
Then we have to make a specific description

957
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
We have a way to fix it, right?

958
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,800
Then the method we use is to choose Context

959
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,100
So it doesn't have to know

960
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,400
Anyway, it's just a description, right?

961
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,900
But this one is more important

962
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,800
Here's what you, a good doctor, should know

963
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,100
You know your professor should be at

964
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,900
I dare not speak nonsense about the mathematics department

965
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,800
I know for sure it will come, but I dare not talk nonsense

966
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,300
That space conversion is like this

967
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,100
That is to say we speak phonetically like this

968
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,900
That is to say, I hope to say that in MISPACE

969
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,700
If I want to describe the job

970
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,100
It is very complicated to measure it differently for each person

971
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Can I convert it to a converted Space

972
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,100
Then his average rotation here and there has nothing to do with the size change

973
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,700
this problem

974
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,100
So we have to make the original knowledge

975
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,600
It turns out that I have done a lot of knowledge

976
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
One knowledge moves its hope elsewhere

977
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,900
Then this law is issued using an ISO-MAP

978
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,600
It is a method of induction and high learning that can be applied

979
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
that's how it works

980
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,900
That is to say, I hope to move all the people in Taipei to Kaohsiung

981
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,200
But there is a limitation and a conditional limitation that is

982
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,400
I hope people in Daan District are still in Kaohsiung or Daan District

983
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
People in Daxiong District are still in Daxiong District

984
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,600
People in Wenshan District used to be able to get together in Kaohsiung

985
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,500
So the interior will put it out

986
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,300
In this case, through a so-called ISO-MAP method

987
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,200
It's easier to explain with this picture

988
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,700
Suppose I have a continuous action so many

989
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,100
In the space of this transform

990
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,200
I just talked about the maple space of the transform

991
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
It's not as if going here to here is

992
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,720
That track came this way, transported here

993
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,940
there is a red line

994
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,640
Let's say I'm short because of my age

995
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,400
A few friends are broken here

996
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,360
It's equivalent to saying that I'm broken after I got here

997
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,840
and start again here

998
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,640
So how do I follow this path from this place

999
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,040
There are many points along the way

1000
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
I find a most appropriate trajectory

1001
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,800
let it go here

1002
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
make it look

1003
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,880
after connecting

1004
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,080
make it visually continuous

1005
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,320
this is what we do

1006
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
the problem is this

1007
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,640
then i just said

1008
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Let's flip that Nebel all over

1009
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,040
So Nebel is still Nebel

1010
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
When I arrived in Kaohsiung, it was still Nebel

1011
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,280
So in this situation

1012
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,080
we ask to say

1013
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,520
when we search step by step

1014
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,920
the next person you're looking for

1015
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,520
Must be your Nebel close by

1016
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,960
The second is the directionality when you look for it

1017
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,760
Must be directional

1018
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,040
Can it change too much

1019
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,720
Because it wants to say it can't change too much

1020
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,200
So we have these two constraints of doing

1021
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,160
So we did some traditional

1022
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Then do a BitWord prediction

1023
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Then we arrange a Priority list for each point of Ford Word and BitWord prediction

1024
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It is the definition name definition name definition name definition name each age point each has a definition name definition name definition name definition name definition name

1025
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So here's a story to tell, a story about my life.

1026
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Each defined name and the last set define the name

1027
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Obviously my kid knows it, obviously the kid takes the first place in the exam every month, he doesn’t necessarily define the name in the exam every day

1028
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So this means that there are a lot of people who are in the local area and they can comment on it.

1029
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
But he has no exceptional majority, he has no greater vision, no one thinks

1030
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The general direction is relatively large, a thought of Wei Mou

1031
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So it's like he takes the first place in every exam but he only defines the name there

1032
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
He will not define the name when he goes out, because some he dare not watch him do it as if he kicked a lot of things

1033
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Because of the things that come out of the test, how should the football style be blown?

1034
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
There are so many lectures in the textbook

1035
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So many times we learn

1036
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Actually

1037
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The book is messed up and I missed it

1038
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
so in this place

1039
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
we just use one

1040
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Marco Manfio

1041
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,500
what he does is

1042
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,000
Blood Over Optimization

1043
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
that is to say he

1044
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
not take everyone down

1045
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
He just takes something and puts it together

1046
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Will definitely in the future

1047
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
total downturn

1048
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
make you visually look

1049
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
is very free

1050
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
very eye-catching

1051
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that this one

1052
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I will learn here

1053
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
this is my student

1054
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's the student who was just presenting

1055
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This is too big

1056
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I found out he has graduated

1057
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
he works on his own

1058
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Then here's his action

1059
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
what we are going to do here

1060
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Our interface is like this

1061
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That is to say, what I just did

1062
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
deduct

1063
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
from own

1064
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
get your share

1065
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
remove it all

1066
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's human animation

1067
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
remove it

1068
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Then we use Forework

1069
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Bitwell Tracking

1070
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Then Optimize

1071
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
find these things later

1072
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I figured it out and plugged it in

1073
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
just hope he visually looks like

1074
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Although the seven chapters are missing

1075
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
but i go somewhere else

1076
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
unfolded

1077
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,720
After it is inserted into the sip, your movements seem to be continuous

1078
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,640
Okay, maybe that's the case, then I'll fix it

1079
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,040
Here is a road section, which often happens abroad

1080
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,480
This is when we lost the journal, that Evita said that you should try this benchmark

1081
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Can I compare myself with others

1082
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
this is me again

1083
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,240
it walks through this pillar

1084
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,920
Then we have to do something like walking through this pillar without that pillar

1085
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Okay, let's take a look

1086
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
yes sorry

1087
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,920
right it is

1088
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,920
We are all better than the best, I don't want to broadcast it now, then I will quip to see that there is a problem

1089
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,920
Then this is another example, this is the example we originally gave, this is one of my students, I am looking for the fattest student

1090
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Because, why find the fattest student, because when it walks over there, the fattest student can cover the column

1091
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,920
Well, that's just that difficulty is the hardest

1092
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,920
then we can take a look

1093
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,900
You see it's been covered for a long time, because it's so thin, it's been covered twice as long

1094
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,400
This is how we find a way to identify a crude object

1095
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,900
This is the result we made, as if that didn't stand there either

1096
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:21,900
So in fact, this problem can be solved

1097
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,400
In the following part, you will feel even more that one day the current computing center will discuss Wang Dawei

1098
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,000
Wang Dawei told me, you are so powerful, you are like this

1099
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,500
The two Chinese in front of the activity center, can you ask him to type

1100
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,000
I said you are crazy, you bought it for 9 million, you don’t want to give it away

1101
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,500
Because what if it breaks in the fight?

1102
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
But he gave me an idea, a good idea

1103
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
That means can I just give me a picture and I'm going to apologize

1104
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,300
Let me take another photo for you, I tell you to move, is that okay?

1105
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,900
It's ok, because that thought just now is ok

1106
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
so we can be like this

1107
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,160
never talk

1108
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,200
That's it, this is the eight-star female president

1109
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,700
It's just that mother is miserable recently

1110
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,600
It's her eight stars who spent more than 10 billion

1111
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,640
Then Cosmopolitan

1112
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,900
then no first place

1113
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,140
so miserable

1114
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,400
Then we only have one picture of her

1115
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,240
i might be able to make her move

1116
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,540
may be able to make her move

1117
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,540
Because this goes back to the question

1118
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,040
I made a mistake just now

1119
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,900
If I'm not wrong you correct me

1120
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,900
Because the law should not be corrected

1121
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,100
i'm actually talking

1122
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,400
that we are doing that

1123
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
I just talked about transform

1124
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,000
If I get to the mask of transform

1125
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,300
Manual's Mask Words

1126
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,400
I can

1127
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,100
rotation, translation, scaling, environment

1128
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,700
Just stay the same

1129
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,500
Then I can't call this president

1130
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,300
So show me these moves

1131
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,500
what should I do

1132
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,900
because the front side

1133
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
rotation, translation, scaling

1134
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,400
I just ask a student to do it

1135
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
i am a student

1136
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,600
and leave some tracks over there, right?

1137
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,360
So I can Normalize this picture

1138
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,560
Then switch to that Space to find its trajectory

1139
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,720
See which point the Match is at

1140
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,280
Pull to both sides after Match arrives

1141
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,360
Then put StoeD's Match on it

1142
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,400
this is done

1143
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,400
so it can stare

1144
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,880
Of course there is still a disadvantage

1145
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,400
I can't help it because of our sleeve

1146
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,320
some things are not so easy

1147
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,760
but it moves

1148
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,360
and you look up beyond this angle

1149
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,000
down beyond this angle

1150
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,960
So you can move without words

1151
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,760
Mao Zedong can also move

1152
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,000
The dean can also move

1153
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,520
The dean can also move

1154
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,400
So the dean only has this photo

1155
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,760
And it's the picture we rotated from up

1156
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,280
then be able to move it

1157
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,720
So research is actually quite fun.

1158
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,740
So it doesn't count too much if you don't limit yourself

1159
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Actually doing research is very interesting

1160
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
good

1161
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,740
The next thing I want to talk about is Tangyou production

1162
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,740
What is the relationship between this and the length of the digit point?

1163
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,740
When some old films were shot, it was

1164
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,740
Because the previous camera was not good

1165
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,740
so the old one

1166
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,740
It wasn't digital before

1167
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,740
digital now

1168
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,740
It used to be that analog

1169
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,740
So when he was

1170
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,740
Not well tuned without contrast

1171
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,740
It's because his contrast is not good.

1172
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,740
He actually has some places

1173
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,740
His performance will be very bad

1174
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,740
so this

1175
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,740
Tangyou production means

1176
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,740
Automatically find the inside of the photo

1177
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,740
That comparison is poor

1178
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,740
Where the contrast is relatively poor

1179
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,740
Because usually the contrast is poor, which means

1180
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,740
little change in his routine

1181
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,740
so often

1182
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,740
so you can't see the details in him

1183
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,740
can not tell

1184
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,740
So our

1185
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,740
This classmate is Xiao Deyu

1186
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,740
I have written an article about cover-up

1187
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
we are doing this research

1188
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
After the result was written, it was so touching

1189
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
A lot of girls who are always vegetarian ask me where she is

1190
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
want to marry her

1191
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
while she is excellent

1192
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
she's still in that seattle

1193
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Watching the Seattle

1194
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
because i'm about to graduate

1195
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I have graduated from National Taiwan University

1196
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Then this is Thorough Production

1197
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
This is the only one I can't see clearly

1198
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
After I passed Thorough Production

1199
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I can see this love quote on Saham

1200
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
considering

1201
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
This was done earlier

1202
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Made in 2008 and 2009

1203
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
good

1204
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
The first step is to compare

1205
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Find it in a lower place

1206
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Then what

1207
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Make adgregation of these places that are relatively close

1208
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
then again is to put it simply

1209
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
adgregation

1210
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I will also compare it and enlarge it

1211
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
For example, the rules here

1212
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Originally only 10

1213
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I now increase it to 50

1214
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Then it will be compared

1215
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
it's easier to see

1216
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
But there is a difficulty with this rule

1217
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
That is to say, you put this

1218
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,100
This is an area compared to

1219
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,200
what about other places

1220
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,900
It's somewhere else

1221
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,100
So we handle the bounds with

1222
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,320
We use Biofeter

1223
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,100
Biofeter's Fetter

1224
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,300
After processing it, it becomes like this

1225
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,500
really easy

1226
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,100
really easy

1227
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,100
but did it for a year

1228
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,100
been doing this for a long time

1229
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,900
not so easy

1230
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,200
So I just told you

1231
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,400
decade east west

1232
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,800
It's over in an hour and a half

1233
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,600
this is what we made

1234
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,900
the result made at that time

1235
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,700
there's a downside

1236
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,500
so we go out and take pictures

1237
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,000
because it doesn't matter anyway

1238
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,200
this is that

1239
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,900
Model photo

1240
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,900
grabbed from the internet

1241
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,300
This is real

1242
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,800
Look, this is Baojing

1243
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,100
Just use the agency to do this

1244
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
This is a posing picture, he thinks he is black enough, so he can see the camera, not necessarily like it

1245
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It didn't turn out well, so he found out

1246
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
This is an old photo, because our target is actually an old photo, the old photo you want to do

1247
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It is actually very difficult to make old photos, because the bottom of his table is dark

1248
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:33,000
There are no cultural relics in the cake here, so as I said, there are cultural relics in the cake, and the efficiency of children is not as good.

1249
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:41,000
You can also see things under the table, which is the old photo he improved, the quality of the old photo posted by Su Bai

1250
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:51,000
The next one is what we are going to do, it is also in, I am an old film, because he was filming on the battlefield, on the battlefield

1251
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So when shooting, there was no way to fix it at that time, because you can’t fix it in the battlefield, and the fixation is hit by the side.

1252
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So while shooting, the bullets will fly over.

1253
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,480
So it will have a lot of vibration problems like this

1254
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,720
So let's take a look at the vibrating thing, it's probably like this

1255
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:15,200
This is the one from the ship

1256
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,360
Taken from the top of the other car

1257
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,200
A car that vibrates like this above

1258
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,320
how do we do this

1259
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,880
What we actually do is

1260
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,680
We want to say something that can be shaken like this

1261
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,240
compensate it back

1262
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,240
Look at the one next to it, everyone

1263
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,360
side shock absorber

1264
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,480
also absorb it

1265
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,240
just suck it up

1266
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,800
very stable in the middle

1267
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,240
Well, we should know better now

1268
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,120
Why do rich people wait so long

1269
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,800
Because the rich man drives a double-avoidance car

1270
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,960
The shock absorbers of the double avoidance are not good

1271
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,320
That's more like my home

1272
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,560
I drive the clear suspension

1273
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,240
that is worse

1274
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,440
You know there are a lot of shocks among us

1275
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,760
that many arrangements

1276
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,800
that's the sport

1277
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,760
jump over five will six

1278
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,160
But if you open the double V, it will be sucked up by righteousness

1279
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,600
So it can live 5 to 9

1280
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,800
Because in fact, I often suspect that my internal organs are abnormal

1281
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,000
good

1282
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,200
good

1283
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,300
That's probably how it's done here

1284
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,300
That is to say, this is how we do it

1285
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,400
Because an X axis along with the time axis is called XT slice

1286
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,600
Y axis This Y axis changes a Y slice with time

1287
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,100
Y軸YT slice

1288
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,700
So XT sliceYT slice

1289
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,600
I seem to have gone very badly

1290
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,500
because it vibrates

1291
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
So we figured out how to use image processing

1292
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,400
Do Panel smoothing now

1293
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,200
After bringing it back, the video was patched

1294
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,900
just like

1295
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,700
hot hills california have some houses

1296
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:39,700
It is because after the earthquake

1297
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,800
It's designed like a sink

1298
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,700
put a lot of water in it

1299
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,700
Then

1300
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,900
When the earthquake comes

1301
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,600
house didn't bite

1302
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,200
It's the bucket of water biting

1303
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,500
Then take off these things

1304
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,100
i put it

1305
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,900
This will also come off

1306
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,000
fix it

1307
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,100
right

1308
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,300
so

1309
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
I'm not necessarily right

1310
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,000
I just

1311
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
it is sucked

1312
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Then this is on the left and here is that

1313
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
On the right this is the one that was stabilized

1314
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
The one on the left can jump

1315
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
On the right is the result of being stabilized

1316
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
This is the way to fix the old one

1317
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Problem with video shake

1318
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
there is another story

1319
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I will talk about this research with my students

1320
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
We come from this study

1321
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Every study has a story to tell you

1322
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
this story first

1323
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
This Dr. Chen Dengyi is now

1324
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Associate Professor of the Department of Virology at Raw University

1325
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
he did very well

1326
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Now a fast-track professor

1327
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
At that time it was my post-doc

1328
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
At that time, I did post-doc with me in the middle

1329
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
His Ph.D.

1330
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
This Dr. Chen is married

1331
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
What about this topic?

1332
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
This topic is like this

1333
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
just say

1334
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Because I was in 2004 to 2008

1335
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
From 2008 to 2001 I participated in a book

1336
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Another program called Specialized Science

1337
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Department of Mechanical Engineering

1338
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,900
His host is Cai Wenxiang, Vice President of Jiangdong University

1339
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,140
He is also the former president of Asia University

1340
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,040
They are very strict, so he set us up

1341
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,960
Therefore, for the financial plan, he pays the university himself as the main body

1342
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,560
He stipulated that we say that you have to transfer one million in four years

1343
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,360
In the past, I rarely thought of counting transfers.

1344
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,720
This part is well done, it doesn't really cost money

1345
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,720
that's enough to make you happy

1346
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,200
And he's busy and doesn't have time to spend money, and he's quite rich

1347
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,800
so you don't think about making money

1348
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,300
But because the college stipulates you, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates you, you have to transfer

1349
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,000
20% of the transferred money belongs to the Ministry of Economic Affairs

1350
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
The Ministry of Economic Affairs also needs to have performance

1351
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
10% will stipulate that Kangdong University

1352
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Because I don't like messing with middle-aged homes, because you will be...

1353
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,500
Because he can only give back 10%

1354
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,000
For me, if I do this project, if it is finished

1355
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
He gave me 70%, I can let the students go abroad

1356
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,800
let them do a lot of things

1357
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
What about Chen Dingyou?

1358
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,400
One of the topics we did was to put a camera on the TV field

1359
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:13,120
When the exhibition is going to be held, I hope to know when it will be on display for 8 hours today

1360
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,980
How many people have watched this TV show, watched this advertisement, or this boost

1361
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:21,940
So he must look here, then I count how many people there are

1362
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,660
Then you can’t double count, because if the count is inaccurate, the owner doesn’t want this advertising machine

1363
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,260
So this Chen Dengyi, at that time was in the business world in 2008

1364
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,500
Because he gave me 800,000 yuan, then I want to say, I thought at that time that the middle business was capable, and you were still very important

1365
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,820
So I told him, you can tell someone a good

1366
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,260
I said tell him, if you can't do it, you don't need money

1367
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:49,060
But at that time, I was in business in 2008, and I made three post-docs to do this

1368
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:53,680
Waiting for money is not enough, that is to say, one person and one group

1369
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,700
As far as Chen Dengyi and Chen Duo are in one group, the other two post-docs are in another group

1370
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,320
Actually there are two I know they can't do it because they are not the specialty

1371
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,080
I'm negative

1372
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Ingredient moon

1373
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,600
Don't let them do it in three months

1374
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,100
Because the business is going to be full

1375
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:04,900
so i just say

1376
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:05,540
we are monday

1377
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,300
your monday

1378
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:08,000
we'll have a meeting

1379
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,900
Manufacturers discuss here on Thursday

1380
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,200
how to continue

1381
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,900
Monday is an internal meeting

1382
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,600
Monday I just need to see the DD of the composition month

1383
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,600
I don't even know it's over

1384
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,800
then we will be in january

1385
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,000
It's almost New Year's Eve in January

1386
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,100
January to February

1387
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,300
I haven't made anything for a month

1388
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,700
Because we just wanted to be lazy

1389
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,000
The one who wants Open Source

1390
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,100
Make Decatur

1391
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,400
Then you can't use it

1392
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,200
So we later actually

1393
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,600
We only do it for two months

1394
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,800
just made it

1395
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,200
That

1396
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,100
Dr. Moon Cheng

1397
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,400
his wife

1398
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,600
It didn't take long for their hearts to grieve

1399
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,900
Bi Xiao is still very small

1400
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,600
that component month

1401
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,800
you know i'm on monday

1402
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,900
right or wrong

1403
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:41,300
the meeting

1404
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,700
he monday

1405
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:45,000
you'll know he had a miserable saturday

1406
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,200
that sunday

1407
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,100
every time he

1408
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,000
His wife is more painful

1409
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,300
because he didn't eat that day

1410
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,800
Take this camera home with you every month

1411
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,000
he kept changing clothes

1412
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,600
Then his son kept changing clothes

1413
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,900
That's dad going to test the system

1414
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,500
is it good or not

1415
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I'm finally changing clothes

1416
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'm called rescue, I'm a first-class rescuer, you see I'm so poor that I'm dying

1417
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And then tell me to keep changing clothes

1418
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So, but we made it four months, three months later

1419
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
we made it

1420
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I won't go into the details, we'll just make it

1421
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:29,000
This is Chen Deying, Dr. Chen

1422
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
This is Xiao Deying, the Tangwei Hiroshi University that I just talked about, because of the one by Ilu Watson

1423
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
This is Dr. Sun, who is now at the University of the Arts, and his assistant is called

1424
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
These guys, he's doing the test

1425
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
that's probably it

1426
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
The result of the test is

1427
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
This is that year

1428
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,200
The thing just now was made in April of 2004 and 2008

1429
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,380
made by the system

1430
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,260
And then we get the end of the year

1431
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,100
Get Small Business Week of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

1432
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,900
That product got the Weekly Small Business Contact Research Award

1433
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,600
2009 Typec Computex Typec Best Choice Award

1434
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,160
Really 800,000

1435
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,520
Then I also gave him the technology of this technology

1436
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,720
HG that environment company

1437
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,400
That's 800,000

1438
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,720
That's the 800,000 he said

1439
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,660
You get paid when you make it

1440
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,380
That's the logo they won the award

1441
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,580
then this is an exhibition

1442
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,460
Exhibition in April

1443
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,580
3 days from April 16th to 18th

1444
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,580
8 hours a day

1445
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,820
24 hours in total

1446
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,060
The environmental company sent two people down below

1447
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,620
Calculate light out

1448
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:46,060
Count how many people are right or wrong

1449
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,260
90% accuracy

1450
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,420
it's august

1451
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,720
August 21 to 24

1452
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,420
also 4 days

1453
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,320
7 days in total

1454
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,220
It is also 90% correct in 6 hours

1455
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,880
for ad groups

1456
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,880
90 is the best number

1457
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,100
you 150

1458
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,040
Because he only uses paperwork

1459
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,120
How much is it? 150 is too much

1460
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,400
90 is a little discount

1461
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,600
because it will not be too low

1462
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,120
50 like a toy

1463
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,760
50 is not as good as counting with some battalions

1464
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,840
Okay, so that's what we did just now

1465
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,080
yes, just haven't finished

1466
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,200
The most perfect future 80

1467
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,440
70% people, 13% off

1468
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,640
Because 20% goes to the Ministry of Economy

1469
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,840
10% to Jiaotong University

1470
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,560
so the toy comes with

1471
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,360
70% back to my lab

1472
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,360
I will give 200,000 to Chen Deng and Chen Shi

1473
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,560
Then I had two conferences that year

1474
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,360
one in germany and one in sielog

1475
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,160
I will use the funds from our department

1476
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,760
Let Dr. Chen Dengyi go to the meeting

1477
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,960
Then take his wife with him

1478
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,960
I give him 200,000

1479
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,960
after going twice

1480
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,160
After the meeting, his wife came back and asked him

1481
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,160
Do you have any plans?

1482
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,760
It's good to go abroad, right?

1483
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,960
You can go abroad by sitting in the cinema

1484
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,360
so sometimes it's like that

1485
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,960
it's fun it's fun it's here

1486
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,560
Most of you are very incomprehensible

1487
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,960
But you can change a lot of clothes to go abroad

1488
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,260
sometimes good

1489
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,760
then next

1490
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,900
I just forgot to tell Rui

1491
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,700
What the hell are we doing at PinkPinkCondom

1492
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,360
It doesn't matter how long it is

1493
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,000
It counts a bit long relation like this

1494
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,860
Because I just said we got a lot of V streams

1495
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,300
Ditch type V flow inside BetaFace

1496
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,760
we wish to say

1497
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,200
quick search right?

1498
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,660
If I have a way to quickly know about this V flow

1499
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,160
calculation past

1500
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,460
I know the clip that says this V flow

1501
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,800
about how many people

1502
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,500
I can do a quick search

1503
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,800
i can say ok

1504
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,200
We put so many V streams inside this clip

1505
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,000
you find me

1506
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,800
There are too many clips with less than 10 people

1507
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,500
find it for me

1508
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,700
In this case, it is a shooting group

1509
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,700
So PinkPinkCondom is already important

1510
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,500
So we did another study here

1511
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,200
It is a method of Tutas to calculate

1512
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,260
This algorithm is different

1513
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,800
This is in front of that advertising machine

1514
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,200
look different there

1515
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,700
Because this place belongs to L780

1516
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,800
That is, how else can you tell me how many people are here?

1517
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,100
You have to do the math for a while

1518
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,800
this place too

1519
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,800
how many people have to count

1520
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,800
it's difficult

1521
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,640
The reason for the difficulty is that usually the resolution of the cancoder is not good

1522
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,400
Furthermore, crowds often have problems covering each other.

1523
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Then the appearance is different, some people are squatting and some are standing

1524
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,800
Some feet are in a hurry

1525
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,900
So there are many, many different questions

1526
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,700
Then do this thing I just said

1527
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,200
It can do a search, that is, search for video information

1528
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,200
But it has other business opportunities

1529
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,400
What business opportunity?

1530
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,500
For example, here at this intersection

1531
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,300
If I put a cancoder here

1532
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,400
put one or two cancoder

1533
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,200
Then I know that now there are many

1534
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,500
I can do traffic control

1535
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,000
I can issue that traffic signal and say

1536
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,300
you can put it now, there are many more

1537
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,200
Because there are a lot of tools here

1538
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,000
In MRT or when not to take a taxi

1539
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,700
It may have several scalators

1540
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,000
defense ladder

1541
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
if open anytime

1542
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,200
It's actually very bad

1543
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,800
So if I can use this way

1544
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,400
To estimate how many legal persons

1545
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,100
or by MRT

1546
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,800
When there are multiple legal persons, I can only open one step or three steps

1547
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,500
That's how you do crowd control

1548
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,000
so it will

1549
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
so many things

1550
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,400
Our approach is not to go into details

1551
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,600
There are two PASS

1552
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,400
one is the part that counts

1553
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,200
One is the part that requires learning tools

1554
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,000
Because it is easier to see the picture

1555
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,600
Our first pass is

1556
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,600
We do not use BASS

1557
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,000
Because it is impossible to use the human form to calculate

1558
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,200
because it would be too slow

1559
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,400
because you're going to say

1560
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,400
here alone here alone

1561
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,200
use a model to correct

1562
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,000
don't count too slowly

1563
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,600
So we treat a person as a bunch of people

1564
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,200
Just a group of people is a bunch of people

1565
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,000
relatively large lump

1566
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,400
Then a person is relatively small

1567
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,400
It is BLOCK

1568
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,800
Use BLOCK's BASS method to calculate

1569
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,700
So we're talking like this

1570
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,400
there are two people here

1571
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,800
But because they cover each other

1572
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,100
so he will

1573
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,800
In fact, its area will become smaller

1574
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,000
will be deducted in the end

1575
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,400
So in our second step

1576
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,800
just add it back

1577
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,400
Another one that will come out is

1578
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,300
in turn will be more

1579
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,700
is the shaded part

1580
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,000
if the shadow

1581
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
it was actually a person

1582
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It becomes 1.4 1.5 people

1583
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
in this situation

1584
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,100
We are on the second pass

1585
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,800
recycule

1586
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,800
During the recycle part

1587
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,400
to buckle it back

1588
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,100
So we devised some way to do

1589
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
This is B's PASS

1590
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Then use Escender's Colonel

1591
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
there is some math don't tell this

1592
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
of course we need to know

1593
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Gento in different locations

1594
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Because of that Perspective effect

1595
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So farther, closer

1596
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
it varies in size

1597
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So we're going to deal with these issues

1598
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
no flat problem

1599
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
This is B's PASS

1600
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
even the shadow part

1601
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
As far as the part of Acclusion and shadow

1602
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
We have to find a way to add it back and get it back

1603
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
we are going to estimate this

1604
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
How many people are there in Field View?

1605
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
How fast are we going?

1606
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
10 sheets per second

1607
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
10 pictures per second is actually more than a mistake

1608
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
why

1609
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
because now i have to estimate

1610
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
The government also wants this

1611
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
especially when exercising

1612
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
How many people does the president actually have?

1613
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
how many people with him

1614
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
sorry to say

1615
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The police are actually looking for me

1616
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
use this suggestion

1617
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
OK, let's see the results of the experiment.

1618
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Then of course we have to experiment with the best stuff

1619
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,460
This paper is actually a topic that I mean is actually very applicable

1620
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,460
It's not that you can't get the best stuff

1621
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,100
Our paper is an air separation called ACM's Malhany UV

1622
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,100
Its Rooge UV is probably less than S

1623
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,100
This Longpaper

1624
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,100
It's actually a pretty good paper

1625
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,100
Then let's compare it to the best interpretation

1626
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,100
What I want to explain is that people count

1627
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,600
It's a yellow line wait a minute and you'll see a micro Curve

1628
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,600
Then if there is a State of the Art called Gaussian Process

1629
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,700
Use Green Green Curve

1630
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,700
Then From A to G it is used to have a Curve

1631
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,700
Then our method we use Blue Curve

1632
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,700
So wait a minute and see if Blue is the closest to Red

1633
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,700
just know if our result is the best

1634
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,700
Then we use two KMalhany

1635
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,700
so you can take a look

1636
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,700
It is walking these four lines, four curves are walking

1637
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,200
The blue and red lines are actually close together

1638
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,200
The yellow and green lines are farther apart

1639
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,700
I don't necessarily share too much

1640
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,700
I only share the easier one

1641
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:25,000
This Benchmark is UXD, which is what Shengli Diego learned from them, and it is one of several Cameras made

1642
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
They want to do experiments, so they use Benchmark, so everything has to be compared with them

1643
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Use this thing as a base, and then compare it to something else

1644
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Wait a minute, he has a lot of places suddenly wrapped up by one person, you can take a look

1645
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Our method is the closest to that light place.

1646
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
People start to pack up now, just a group of people

1647
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
He has about 10 pictures per second, and the original speed is 30 pictures per second

1648
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
We can probably count 10, so he should actually be pretty close to an appointment

1649
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
enough for one second

1650
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,500
It is enough to report two records

1651
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,000
this is my last sentence

1652
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,400
You can't talk about this

1653
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,500
does it matter

1654
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,200
In fact, when we were a little long in this book,

1655
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,700
We have to deal with a lot of content

1656
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,800
is the content

1657
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,000
So if I can randomly lock in

1658
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
like say

1659
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,000
I said the eyes in martial arts movies

1660
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,500
I don't know if you watch martial arts movies

1661
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,300
The brightest thing about martial arts movies is

1662
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,800
In fact, a Jianxia

1663
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,300
He just made that one thousand and two yuan

1664
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,300
the best

1665
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,300
The most powerful Jianxia may use a builder

1666
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,300
The most powerful thing is to use the builder

1667
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,800
the kind that weakens you

1668
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,300
The most powerful thing is to use liquid surface

1669
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,300
soon everyone

1670
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,300
so we do anything

1671
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,300
just a mirror

1672
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,300
do not make a mirror

1673
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,300
That is, who is stronger

1674
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,300
then we will do now

1675
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:49,300
to do one thing

1676
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,300
Let's talk about what you're going to do now

1677
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,300
you have no command

1678
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,300
It doesn't matter

1679
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:56,300
That Ye Zehua here

1680
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,300
just now i can't say one

1681
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,300
Ye Zehua is not here

1682
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,300
There is a very important wave in the middle

1683
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I'm done now

1684
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,400
That's what we think now

1685
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,900
I won't correct me it's okay

1686
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,400
Let's move in front of a camera now

1687
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,400
compare with

1688
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,900
just compare it

1689
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,900
But it doesn't matter if you do numbers

1690
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:13,900
casual

1691
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,900
But I was going to make it last now to say

1692
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,900
you can conduct any music

1693
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,400
Speed ​​size

1694
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,900
I'll make you in a second

1695
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,900
can be like this

1696
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,900
But it seems like you're directing this

1697
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,900
But the final question is a bit more difficult

1698
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,400
Then our first step is to deal with

1699
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,400
From two-dimensional space to three-dimensional space

1700
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
There is a big Gab

1701
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,400
take a look everyone

1702
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,400
This is the size of Gb

1703
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,400
This is what we hope to use Kinnet

1704
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
on the microphone

1705
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,400
Scalaton sequence captured by Kinnet

1706
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,900
we want it to become

1707
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,900
Two things

1708
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,900
hope it turns into something with measurements

1709
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,900
Then it becomes the action of the skeleton block

1710
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,400
But finally there's a big Gab

1711
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,400
It's just using the two-circle thing

1712
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,400
What's around again is actually

1713
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,400
scared

1714
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,480
if it is large

1715
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,720
Then we want to say that this two-dimensional thing

1716
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,740
I just because I was talking I took a

1717
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,800
also such a thing

1718
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:10,360
Wait a minute to conduct all kinds of different music

1719
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,680
Of course, we need to deal with three-dimensional

1720
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,080
After the three-dimensional estimation comes out and then goes back

1721
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,160
to manipulate the action

1722
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,240
You're the only one who can manipulate. It's beautiful. It's great.

1723
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,920
So there's one in the middle that we need to fill up

1724
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,560
So we do it in two ways

1725
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,800
Ye Zhehua, Dr. Ye has someone who taught him

1726
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,960
Skip over first Skip 2D to 3D

1727
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,200
Just use Kinet Microsoft KINET

1728
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:31,880
directly

1729
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,080
Because of Microsoft KINET when he shoots he can

1730
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,280
can shoot

1731
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,560
It is RGB is the usual RGB sequence

1732
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,840
Square sequence with DEVS

1733
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,280
跟Square sequence

1734
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,200
All three can be shot

1735
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,840
But it has a property that its distance

1736
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,480
Or within three years and five meters

1737
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,760
Only then can you shoot well

1738
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,640
So it is impossible for us to have every sequence such as

1739
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,720
Of course we

1740
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,880
you like that

1741
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,200
It's okay to be in front of a certain camera like that

1742
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,240
because it sure can shoot

1743
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,400
That Kinel is more expensive

1744
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,000
you can use an ordinary video camera

1745
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,400
it's best if you can do it

1746
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,200
Then what we Kinel will do is

1747
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,400
How to fill the relationship between the two and the three

1748
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,400
That

1749
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,700
for example

1750
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:12,900
I am using Kinel here

1751
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,100
Catch this person's RGB sequence

1752
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:15,900
Is there DAPS

1753
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,900
this is the depth

1754
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,400
This is the Spalding sequence

1755
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,300
that I just said

1756
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:22,100
its greatest difficulty is its distance

1757
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,800
Must be within 3.5 meters

1758
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,800
Now we have a question, which is

1759
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,600
I ask my classmates to help

1760
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,800
Everyone in our laboratory will go to exercise

1761
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,500
is to do various actions

1762
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,900
MultiNet

1763
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,200
grab two angles

1764
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:34,900
one is 0 degrees

1765
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,200
one is 45 degrees

1766
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,400
is this 45 degrees

1767
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,000
right

1768
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:40,700
45 degrees

1769
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,500
these two angles

1770
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,900
Because everyone acts differently

1771
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:43,800
do a lot like

1772
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,900
I remember I went jumping around that day too

1773
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,700
this is me

1774
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,700
student score student score

1775
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,700
Actually when I

1776
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:51,500
teacher, you go back

1777
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,000
Go forward

1778
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,100
jump up

1779
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,700
climb down like this

1780
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,600
stop that

1781
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,400
pat this thing straight

1782
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,000
good

1783
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
that's how we think

1784
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,800
I can use RGB, because the RGB system does not have the 3.5 meter one

1785
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,920
Usually because of my Pinet it will build this DataFace

1786
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:10,800
Its limit is 3.5 meters on one side

1787
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,500
But my video just happens to be

1788
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,000
I didn't have Pinet at all when I was doing it

1789
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,800
Then it has an RGB that is a Sequence of 2 degrees

1790
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,840
how do i use it to tune

1791
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,000
to the corresponding action

1792
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Then by the way, you can use its depth and its skeleton

1793
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,000
Use these actions

1794
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,400
This is my idea

1795
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,400
So what we do is say

1796
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,400
I first use the RGB system to tune

1797
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,400
You can use it at the same time after you transfer it

1798
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,400
Depth and Skeleton Information

1799
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,400
It's not that easy to do this

1800
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,800
If you want to use RGB and UDAVS Information at the same time

1801
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,800
Its two marking systems and its Future Space are different

1802
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,000
So we have to go through a program called Communical

1803
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Communical Coordination Analysis

1804
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,800
Bring these two marking systems into a standard marking system

1805
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,800
These we can use

1806
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,420
use two things together

1807
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,460
it's a must do

1808
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:04,960
Then with this we can see

1809
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,920
You can take a look

1810
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,460
Yesterday, these two people were far away, right?

1811
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,300
He is over 3.5 meters

1812
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,660
One is to search out in Check

1813
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:13,260
One is Cross-on

1814
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,360
Then we use these two Sequence

1815
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,960
To call DataBase

1816
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,760
Corresponding RGB Sequence

1817
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,120
Bax that we can use it later

1818
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,300
let's just say

1819
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,960
OK I use CheckWatch

1820
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,800
Then I can we get from the DataBase

1821
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,260
Get the first year, the second year, the third year

1822
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,460
Then this Cross-on

1823
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:34,420
You can also get the first year, the second year and the third year

1824
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,300
i fell out

1825
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,260
fall out first year

1826
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,000
or fall out the next year

1827
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,500
it's all close action

1828
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,000
Then we can use it at the same time

1829
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,100
Depth and its Skeleton stuff

1830
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,720
to do the following

1831
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,760
mine is

1832
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,460
Ours is filling the second dimension

1833
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,220
Cang Min between the three-dimensional space

1834
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:51,560
OK, let me give you an example

1835
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:56,460
Does this have a T?

1836
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,660
OK

1837
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Then you can adjust its depth and its Skeleton T action

1838
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Then there is this thing that is very useful

1839
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Why? Because after some actions

1840
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
We can use it to change the size of its movement and its speed

1841
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
The size adjustment of the speed is to use the mood of the music

1842
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So this project is actually a combination of many professors.

1843
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:32,000
That is, the previous one from 2D to 3D is based on self-created things, and the neighbor is cooperating with Dr. Neighbor

1844
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Then, of course, my Ph.D. will study, and the housekeeper has joined

1845
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
And then the emotional part of the music

1846
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Here I will talk about the results they tuned out.

1847
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
The results we call out are all better than State or be R

1848
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
So Pay here is actually on Igboe's Generation

1849
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
If there is an IP, I will skip it

1850
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Then what we have next, the next step is how to get it

1851
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Because some of us already have Skeleton

1852
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
But it this Skeleton is music

1853
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,600
Because you just came to measure like this

1854
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,860
OK, that Squad

1855
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:03,960
then i want to change now

1856
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,560
then it directs all kinds of music

1857
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,460
Because the beat of the music will be different

1858
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,560
The form of music will be different

1859
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,200
so the size will be different

1860
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,140
So we're going to analyze the mood of the music

1861
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,940
You ask me what kind of music mood analysis

1862
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,440
Musical mood can be analyzed

1863
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,040
I said advanced moves are bigger

1864
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,240
Sometimes it's weird to be angry

1865
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,740
Well, we happen to have a research assistant at the Capital Innovation Center.

1866
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:25,460
Yang Yuxuan

1867
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,060
He happened to be working on this part

1868
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,260
so we have to bring him over

1869
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,900
let's get him together

1870
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,860
The hardest part is saying

1871
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:35,460
How do I go super power this exclusive

1872
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,260
super power this exclusive

1873
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,140
make it faster, slower, bigger, smaller

1874
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,640
That's why I made a book about Master Wu

1875
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,340
I just lost a Robardis book

1876
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,300
I lost a book of songs, songs, songs

1877
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,200
He didn't miss it when he came

1878
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,300
I just throw him a book

1879
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:47,840
music book

1880
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,040
That was when I was studying in America in 1985

1881
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,340
A textbook was used to read Robardes

1882
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,240
Inside Inverse Kinematics

1883
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,140
Wait a minute and I'll tell you about Kinematics for music

1884
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,900
I know I need to solve this thing

1885
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,100
rely on that thing

1886
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,000
just throw it to him

1887
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,440
Unexpectedly, he made it in two months

1888
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,740
He is very smart, he saw this committee, he went to find similar software on the Internet

1889
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:13,060
He just found one, and he modified it as soon as he changed it.

1890
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,840
so he finished it quickly

1891
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,480
Then I changed the movement, the size and the rhythm of the music

1892
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,020
This is the tutor, right?

1893
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,060
Well, it seems to me that four months and three months are enough.

1894
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:27,660
So I threw these well-made assistant teachers to the professors of Tsinghua University

1895
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:32,000
It is the constant fruit, let him change the original tation

1896
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,620
Just pasting the stance of the body so that it doesn't change visually

1897
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,460
this is what we do

1898
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:45,320
Then I teach, we just did it like this, this is done casually, this is my student, he is in music

1899
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,380
so he looks good commanding

1900
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:50,700
This is casual music, just ask him to conduct

1901
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:57,860
Just according to the concept I just had, we use the mood of the music

1902
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,700
because we need to keep quiet

1903
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,700
this is pasted

1904
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,600
it just didn't move

1905
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,600
move now

1906
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,900
This is what we hope to say

1907
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,900
you just think it's over

1908
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,000
Might be able to get a product in the future

1909
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,700
maybe you're getting bored

1910
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,600
So it's not bad for you to go back and get this

1911
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,200
you go live that

1912
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,400
The product with six points

1913
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,200
Is the live broadcast good or not?

1914
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:34,600
and you

1915
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:35,700
What you have to do

1916
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,800
right in front of my camera

1917
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,100
no casual comparison

1918
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,200
we'll figure it out

1919
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,300
make different music

1920
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,300
race by statue

1921
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,200
that is

1922
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,500
Anyway it is

1923
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,000
Is it right?

1924
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,600
good

1925
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,300
for this part i think i will

1926
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,500
I won't talk too much about the details

1927
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,300
I just want to achieve the result

1928
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,000
Because this part is a little bit involved

1929
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:57,500
what i just said

1930
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Problems with Inverse Kinematics

1931
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,480
That's because I'm telling you why its trajectory matters

1932
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,380
Because when we command, our hands are in space, right?

1933
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,140
The mine disaster is said because its trajectory

1934
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,000
How is this trajectory determined?

1935
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:11,520
you have a dead body here

1936
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,280
A digger looks like a corpse with a digger

1937
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,600
If you are in space, there are still a few points

1938
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,480
When you use one point of its constitution to count back the round

1939
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,080
your light festival place its angle

1940
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:22,320
can be counted

1941
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,680
What about diggers

1942
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,180
The angle of your light festival must conform to the

1943
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,000
the same for people

1944
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,400
Then in human rights you are

1945
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,560
This place might have a wiping attitude

1946
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,520
So when you look at this path planning

1947
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,720
When coming down the same road

1948
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:36,680
In fact, this angle and this angle

1949
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,680
is always changing

1950
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,160
Then we can use

1951
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,080
U-IN-LESS

1952
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,720
Call IN-LESS-KIMATICS round count

1953
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,200
So here are the angles

1954
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,000
how many here

1955
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,320
to the next point

1956
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,240
how much can i calculate this angle

1957
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,120
how much is this point

1958
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,480
So it's a little bit mathematically frequent

1959
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,240
Then, in order to keep its speed relatively controllable

1960
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,560
Because there is an angle change

1961
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,880
Calculate its speed so it doesn't flatten

1962
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:09,440
This, this, this, at least it looks like this, but this, well, that's a function of Jacobian, well, let's see first,

1963
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:16,400
This is the practitioner method. Dr. Ye found out a piece of software, and then he improved it himself. Originally, Wei Wo could improve it.

1964
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,800
Because the one on the left is also the original, not the Skeleton caught by Kinio, he only has the Skeleton to click,

1965
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:26,360
So we use Jieshi's method to find an array. After we have this array,

1966
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:31,160
His problem becomes analyzable Egnatic, so I can plan his path,

1967
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:43,580
You are so fast and slow, I can do it big or small, okay, then this is the path I just talked about, using Inverse

1968
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,800
Maybe the ities will go back, and the part of Midzidimotion is like this, that is to say, Dr. Yang Yuxuan, who I occasionally serve,

1969
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:51,020
Because it can still be divided into secret systems, that is, he has a few superficial studies but wants to talk about Tension,

1970
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:58,440
Tension, tension, activity, he wants to be active, and then Valence, it becomes different,

1971
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,940
That means that in music,

1972
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,480
when each note is played

1973
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,600
It can fall all over it's called

1974
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,940
Affective Space

1975
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:08,520
is the space of emotion

1976
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,280
so your current situation

1977
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,880
You're taking advantage of my brother again in every tone

1978
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,760
can't be destroyed here

1979
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,200
Why are you happy and angry now?

1980
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,360
He quantifies it in this Space

1981
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,200
and this thing

1982
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:22,440
We use two-dimensional things to explain

1983
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,880
There is no sound during this time

1984
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,680
so it is 0 at distance

1985
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,680
it's time 1

1986
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,040
Its Venom is positive

1987
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,000
Its Arrow So is positive a little bit

1988
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,160
it will be here

1989
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,600
T equals 2 will be here

1990
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,680
T equals 3 will be here

1991
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,320
In this so-called Affectual

1992
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,560
Affectual in the Space

1993
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,360
Affectual Space

1994
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,560
It's that emotional space

1995
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,760
Emotional Space

1996
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,120
Then if it counts the distance

1997
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,480
The distance at which time can meet the origin

1998
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:48,640
The distance at which time can meet the origin

1999
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,080
it can become like this

2000
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,600
that its size

2001
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,720
Intensity can be used to command

2002
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,920
Strength

2003
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,560
So use this way

2004
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
we see clips of docs doing

2005
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Everyone see there is a wall

2006
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
It waits to see that the walls will change

2007
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
there are walls

2008
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
The student he was wearing black was a bit of a fraud

2009
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
us

2010
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Because in fact, in this process, I

2011
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,600
I'll show you all

2012
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,100
What we have now is this original version

2013
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,300
It will have Dex Data

2014
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,400
Then to Skeleton

2015
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,700
Then we're going to use Skeleton to do it

2016
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,900
We're going to grab some key Skeletons

2017
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,600
Then take the three spaces I had

2018
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,200
The Front of the second space pushes it up

2019
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,400
try to push up

2020
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,200
and then to analyze its shadowing

2021
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,800
because when we command

2022
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,800
It turns out that when the movement is relatively small, the cover is less

2023
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:29,900
But when you move a lot, the covered area will exceed the original things

2024
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,000
Then all I had was something like this

2025
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But what I'm dealing with the best stuff is

2026
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,500
where is there no

2027
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,200
Then how do I have the same problem as before?

2028
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,100
How do I go and where to grab the proper material

2029
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,300
put it there

2030
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,500
Make your visual look as if it's real

2031
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:46,200
Then I will affect the speed of its command with such words

2032
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,200
The size of these issues

2033
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,800
so I can match the rhythm

2034
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,300
to conduct different symphonies

2035
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,500
Then I just changed the 2D to 3D thing to Skep it

2036
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,400
Then this is the so-called 2n and 2d

2037
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,800
A processing method of 2.5d

2038
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,160
Let me refute it first. The left side is the original one, and the right side is pasted up.

2039
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,560
well, this is now

2040
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,720
Take a look at changing its amplitude

2041
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,360
That is, I can change its amplitude, which is smaller this time

2042
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,680
The action is relatively small, this time

2043
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,480
It's more delicate, you can just put it down

2044
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Alright, the one with the bigger movement this time will only be put down

2045
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,720
Synthetic this time

2046
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,360
Okay, let me refute first, at this time

2047
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Then the next thing is its speed

2048
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Of course it is not the

2049
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's not engraved, but you can see it's already in place

2050
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
ok , this is faster

2051
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
that's all

2052
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Here's where we're looking at its limits to a painting

2053
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
How much is the angle, it will die

2054
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
This is a group of rabbits, it's a little strange that they wear different clothes

2055
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
If it's 30 degrees

2056
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It can be seen from here

2057
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I can still talk about a third decade

2058
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Many questions are constantly sung

2059
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
so what do you think

2060
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,900
It's about people's life

2061
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,800
It is about people saying that life plays its role

2062
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,400
bright future

2063
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,500
it depends on how you see yourself

2064
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,400
you like to solve these problems

2065
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,000
you are full of bright future

2066
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,200
won't you like it

2067
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,800
Then I finally want to talk about my other thing

2068
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:23,400
Every hand has that giblet paper

2069
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,600
The viscera paper, let me explain to you

2070
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,200
That was ten years ago ten years ago

2071
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,800
that once my daughter

2072
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,300
I was in elementary school when I was very young

2073
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,300
She sometimes comes home and asks me

2074
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:37,100
Dad has a kid in the next class

2075
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,100
she has no money for lunch

2076
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:40,800
I said why no money

2077
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
She said her mom gave her 10 bucks a week

2078
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,700
So it took her two days to die this class

2079
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,600
I said so

2080
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,700
so I

2081
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,800
I happened to be at that time

2082
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,600
what did they choose me to be parents will pay my parents

2083
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,200
So I ran to the next class and asked the teacher

2084
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,500
So this child I helped her teach

2085
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,200
But in the future, I will ask the school like this

2086
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,900
how many children does she have

2087
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
have such a problem

2088
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Because when I figured it out, there were ten or twenty students in the school.

2089
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
like this

2090
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
so i go back to the lab

2091
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I tell my students

2092
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
do him a favor

2093
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Then

2094
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
then my relatives

2095
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
and my colleagues

2096
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
My colleague has several colleagues

2097
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
what female robot

2098
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Gao Mingda

2099
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
those I said again

2100
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
i scraped together some money

2101
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
and let these twenty children

2102
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I will be compensated by tutors from all classes.

2103
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
all the money like this

2104
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
but it didn't work for me

2105
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
A house for a group of uncles and aunts who love you

2106
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Then this article is

2107
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I was

2108
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
they thank me

2109
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
thank us with a card

2110
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
thank us

2111
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I write

2112
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Written in the name of a group of uncles and aunts

2113
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
That

2114
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
this poem is

2115
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
That our Editor

2116
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
English Editor

2117
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
English poems he gave me

2118
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I translate it into Chinese

2119
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
and then give it to these kids

2120
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That

2121
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
when i was studying

2122
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
when i went to the interview

2123
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
my advisor

2124
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
i am him

2125
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I was the first PhD student

2126
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I don't know how long he will let me read

2127
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Actually I don't know

2128
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
But many students who go to Taiwan

2129
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Students who go to mainland China will find an American professor

2130
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Because American professors graduated in three years and six years

2131
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
when you read for a long time

2132
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
How did I get my doctorate?

2133
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Two years for master's degree, five years for Ph.D.

2134
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
that sometimes it seems really

2135
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Am I really that far behind?

2136
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
feeling

2137
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Then one day I went to my teacher

2138
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I tell you

2139
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
will you care about him

2140
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
You see their standard is only this

2141
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
my standard is here

2142
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
just do it well

2143
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
later i graduated

2144
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
He told me actually

2145
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
He shoots so high

2146
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Actually you crawl slowly

2147
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
when climbing here

2148
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
He lowered the standard and said you graduated

2149
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
but you should be here

2150
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
i found out that

2151
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
So this is what it looks like

2152
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I'll look at this first

2153
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Why does my project kind of look like

2154
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,880
This is the most concrete manifestation of a young life

2155
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,680
It's the courage to stun Han in the tiger water and blood

2156
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,280
He may encounter many setbacks

2157
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,600
his will

2158
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,760
But his will will not be broken

2159
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,800
If life is a learning process

2160
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,760
He represents our greatest gain

2161
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,520
It is how to grow up in setbacks

2162
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,160
look at the diamonds

2163
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,000
This is the most important

2164
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,840
look at the diamonds

2165
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,120
It is a product of extreme high pressure

2166
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,080
if less stress

2167
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,520
it might just be crystal

2168
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:29,720
if only less stress

2169
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,600
it may be a phase

2170
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,760
if only less stress

2171
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,400
it may just be soil in general

2172
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,080
so if my teacher didn't treat me like that

2173
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,280
I can't be a central researcher long term today

2174
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,960
There is no way to talk about three decades of research

2175
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:45,040
able to last so long

2176
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,920
I often tell my students about this

2177
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,640
就是good judgment comes from experience

2178
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,240
experience comes from the judgment

2179
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,040
very interesting

2180
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,240
your experience is from

2181
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,200
Your good judgment is due to experience

2182
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,200
your experience

2183
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Because of your wrong judgment in the past

2184
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:03,800
it's coming

2185
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,000
so we often fail

2186
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,400
but fails if

2187
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,900
he can't handle your experience

2188
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,400
deal with what beats you

2189
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:12,700
words of a reason

2190
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,700
If it fails, it fails to express

2191
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:15,800
Okay, thank you

2192
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:23,600
any questions

2193
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:26,600
I tell you it's a great show

2194
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,300
any questions

2195
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,200
Thank you teacher for a very wonderful performance

2196
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,200
I'm not sorry

2197
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,500
I may not have understood just now

2198
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,200
it's about that

2199
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,400
a person in action

2200
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,600
But save a lot in the middle

2201
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,500
It’s the place where a lot of friends lost

2202
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,500
The teacher mentioned that there are many points

2203
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,100
Then there is a line in the middle

2204
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,200
When the middle line is gone, the dot is still there

2205
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,700
So you can grab back a line with the highest score

2206
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,400
give the action...

2207
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,600
not point

2208
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,000
In fact, he was

2209
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,200
One of the short sides fully seamed

2210
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,600
A point of feature space

2211
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,200
It's actually a very complicated point

2212
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,160
Cover it with a Shape Context to describe many things

2213
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,320
It is something described by one Beam and many Beams

2214
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,320
So it uses a very simple

2215
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,040
to describe that point

2216
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,200
Unlike our simple math above a three-way empty

2217
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,480
Just use a point conversion

2218
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,040
it is actually a description

2219
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,800
It is described with a Shape Context

2220
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,600
This description is very complicated

2221
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,880
It can describe the gesture very precisely.

2222
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,200
where is it falling

2223
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,600
because when we act

2224
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,800
action is like this in action

2225
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,640
When I cover it with this

2226
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,600
It can be used with different relations

2227
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,800
Described by the ring-by-ring Beam

2228
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,480
Where is your action now?

2229
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,560
but something so complicated

2230
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,680
It can be converted into a Feature Point

2231
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:40,600
Transfer to a spot in Chase Fund

2232
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,160
so it's there

2233
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,800
You can use a high Dimension thing

2234
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,160
to describe its trajectory like this

2235
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,720
so you mean

2236
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,480
Each point is an action combination

2237
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:50,640
Description of dealing with seniors

2238
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,240
not that word

2239
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,520
deal with its background

2240
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,120
Yes

2241
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:55,200
It Features Bay

2242
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,880
Can be a High Dimension Features Bay

2243
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:58,360
who is it

2244
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,400
In fact, I just heard that there is a place that I am very concerned about

2245
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,100
that is

2246
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,600
I trust you as a scholar

2247
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:08,100
what research are you going to do next

2248
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,300
should be from a journal with which you are familiar

2249
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:12,600
Or the discussion of related scholars can understand

2250
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,600
But look inside your speech

2251
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,400
Many research directions seem to be very applied

2252
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,500
and many of us

2253
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,100
In fact, at least I didn't think of it

2254
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,600
how do you get these ideas

2255
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,700
to decide what problem you want to solve

2256
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,800
or from what do you think you can do

2257
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,700
Thanks

2258
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:32,300
This is where my students spend the most time

2259
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,600
looking for a topic

2260
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,800
because when they are looking

2261
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,200
to do this i would not

2262
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,000
do that i don't want

2263
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,300
I know what we're going to do

2264
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,700
Sometimes it's a topic I give them

2265
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,700
i want to do this

2266
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:41,700
it was like this in the early days

2267
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,300
Because the early days were relatively young

2268
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:45,800
I think about many topics

2269
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,300
But because there are more students

2270
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,600
We spend this time talking about

2271
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,000
Do you want to do this topic

2272
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,400
I usually ask him

2273
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,600
What do you think you will contribute after finishing

2274
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,300
if not don't do it

2275
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,300
Don't publish a paper because the future is not good

2276
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,760
what happened to us a while ago

2277
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,960
In fact, I don't deserve much

2278
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,360
If I don't participate in many places, I won't be named

2279
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,960
That's not much cooperation

2280
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,600
Because I don't want to do something I don't understand

2281
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,760
or do something I don't even know

2282
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,440
We spend the most time looking for topics

2283
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,920
Because I think finding a topic

2284
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,560
Determine the height of your research

2285
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:23,920
you found the topic well

2286
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,080
your height is good

2287
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,160
and it's easier for you to do

2288
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:26,960
because of that topic

2289
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,000
Once you think clearly, it will be easy for you to do it

2290
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,840
Because it is a field of Y-Open

2291
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,240
But if say you find a

2292
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,440
follow what others do

2293
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,120
you will work hard

2294
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,880
because it takes a lot of effort

2295
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,320
Why review related things and compare them?

2296
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:40,400
because you follow behind

2297
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,120
you have to do better than him

2298
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,200
Then if you do something new

2299
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,560
no one has done

2300
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:46,400
you did a great job

2301
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,920
you do whatever you want anyway

2302
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,440
Everyone will think it is very good and fun.

2303
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,520
What the teacher is going to say is to say

2304
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,560
In fact, the teacher brainstorms broadly in a clear way

2305
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,040
to find out the topic like this

2306
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,160
i will quiz them

2307
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,400
Back off because that's what I do

2308
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,400
It's not the same in the United States as in Taiwan

2309
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:10,400
In fact, there are many teachers in the United States who let you do it yourself

2310
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,400
But because of that environment, the environment doesn't matter

2311
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,400
Because all your colleagues are like this

2312
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:16,400
so you get used to it

2313
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,400
Taiwan is different

2314
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:21,400
Sometimes there are some students in Taiwan, you don’t need to mention them

2315
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,400
The way to make a point is that this topic is not good, don't do it

2316
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,400
Maybe he didn't understand at the beginning

2317
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,400
But when what we publish later is highly consumed

2318
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,400
He gradually understood why he did this

2319
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,400
Many times we create a wave of elves to see

2320
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,400
No one wants to post, no one wants to see your stuff

2321
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,400
But when you do a lot of things and a lot of people are watching

2322
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,400
you give yourself a confidence

2323
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,400
Moreover, the research environment in Taiwan is relatively good

2324
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,400
Because what we want to improve is our impact not our quantity

2325
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,400
Quantity doesn't matter

2326
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Everyone, think about a question

2327
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
please

2328
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:18,000
sorry

2329
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
piece at digit point

2330
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Saw some of your retouching

2331
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
you know

2332
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
some outside some

2333
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Just some retouching

2334
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
use some off-the-shelf toys

2335
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
like photoshop

2336
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Fotain fact

2337
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
etc.

2338
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
because of you

2339
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
developing this set

2340
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
is self-developed out of

2341
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Is it your own broken stick?

2342
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Or

2343
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
is we play from that school

2344
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Because if you say image processor

2345
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Image processing people rarely use Photoshop

2346
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Because your technique is definitely better than Photoshop

2347
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
That is to say, if you

2348
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Fotoshop doesn't fit as it should

2349
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
everyone can use

2350
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
This thing we designed

2351
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
is to make the national archives available

2352
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
These people can go to repair our handmade

2353
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,400
Very poor quality, just old videos and old photos

2354
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,240
So of course he is technically more advanced.

2355
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:09,400
But almost you might turn around

2356
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,680
It becomes common to promote to everyone

2357
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,400
many need to collect

2358
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,900
Like Art Museum, Sister Gela, M2

2359
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,440
They also have a lot of collections

2360
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,440
Then I hope that the party will do this.

2361
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:24,440
Because we later put that

2362
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,040
Ridio in painting stuff turns it into software

2363
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,440
After the interface was completed, it took a year and a half

2364
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,440
In fact, it is also a harm to Dr. Tang.

2365
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,440
Because that was actually

2366
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,440
It is best if you can do it with the salary of ability and performance

2367
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:44,440
Because we should spend our energy on the hardest part of the front end

2368
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:50,940
Then there's the fact that we don't want to make money

2369
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:54,440
I don't really want to make money, but I hope to do the most advanced things

2370
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:57,640
But someone was able to turn it into usable software

2371
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,740
that's our happiest

2372
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
please

2373
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Thank you professor for letting us see many things

2374
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Because I recently bought a Godfather

2375
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Buray's full set of stuff

2376
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
When there's a Bondest in there explaining how they're going to fix those

2377
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
This seems to be something similar

2378
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
that's what fixes these

2379
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
What's even better about them is that they return to their original color

2380
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Our program also has this function

2381
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Or restore the original color

2382
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
you mean color don't you

2383
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
They were originally when Godfather was filming

2384
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
he has some parts of color

2385
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
because he is for him

2386
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
i change that hue

2387
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
not our main purpose

2388
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
we didn't do that

2389
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
because you've seen that ww2 recently

2390
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,540
Actually, is the video in color?

2391
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:02,500
but it's done well

2392
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,440
This is actually commissioned by the company.

2393
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,500
it was originally black and white

2394
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,000
it does it just fine

2395
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,340
i watched a lot of documentaries

2396
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:10,500
Documentary of that war

2397
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,800
Since that part of the family has already done so well

2398
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,080
that's not our focus

2399
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,000
not a significant part of us

2400
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,400
we want to mend

2401
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,500
is the broken part

2402
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,200
so different

2403
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,600
And the quality of our images is very poor

2404
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:24,800
After Scan

2405
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,000
Good quadding and bad quality

2406
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,600
In fact, when doing

2407
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,600
just now you saw that dog

2408
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,800
Because the dog is missing anyway, it's actually very simple

2409
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,900
Because the dog tone is too clear

2410
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:35,900
easy to find

2411
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,100
easy to handle

2412
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:39,500
but the ladies

2413
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,700
It's not easy

2414
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:45,600
because of the taste between its background

2415
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,600
is big

2416
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,500
So its mouse position is very high

2417
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,200
so it's hard to get it off

2418
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,200
It's the insiders who know it when they see it.

2419
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,900
what does a master look like

2420
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,800
because he knows what to say

2421
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,600
Color is easy to get

2422
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,400
Because it's colored it has tint or something

2423
01:31:58,400 --> 01:31:59,800
it's black and white and that

2424
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,960
when he was filming, when he was plasticizing

2425
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,960
In fact, it introduces a lot of noise

2426
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,960
So when he handles, his beat will

2427
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,960
many issues to deal with

2428
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:17,960
wait a minute there is still a problem

2429
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,960
Do you have any questions?

2430
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,960
what do we learn

2431
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,920
So now the archives office

2432
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,920
The ones you plan to transfer to the Archives Bureau are still in the

2433
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,920
no money, no money

2434
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,920
So we use the state

2435
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,920
digital point length project

2436
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:37,920
so just do it well and leave it to them

2437
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,920
do they have

2438
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,920
They were repairing it a while ago

2439
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,920
Some old videos of Yilan County Government

2440
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,920
old photo

2441
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,920
they will have some

2442
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,920
they will have some

2443
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,880
Feedback questions

2444
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,880
Yes, that one seems to be okay

2445
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,880
seems to be ok

2446
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,880
is that cambers he will

2447
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So it's good to compare with them

2448
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
ask the professor

2449
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Restorative photos of some techniques you just introduced

2450
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
If it's like a painting at the Palais de la Rovere

2451
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
those world cultures

2452
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Is it possible to go through this way

2453
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
to fix

2454
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
to allow him to save

2455
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Always be exactly the same as the original painting

2456
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
if there is a defect

2457
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
If there is a flaw that means it is not well preserved

2458
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Is there a way to go through this

2459
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
here's the fix

2460
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
In fact, this sentence may

2461
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I said that the two words of repairing are not precise enough.

2462
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
In fact, because I changed it to

2463
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
blind your eyes

2464
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
have flaws

2465
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
just start talking like this

2466
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Because it is a digital thing

2467
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
where he was originally flawed

2468
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I use image processing method

2469
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
fooled your eyes

2470
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
so that you don't know that there is a flaw in that place

2471
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
in this way

2472
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
you just introduced that technique

2473
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Is it ever used in

2474
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
that world manga

2475
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
no no no

2476
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
will it let us touch

2477
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
We used to be able to let Menah Lusha

2478
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
smile bigger

2479
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
will it be brighter

2480
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
will it be easier

2481
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Then he smiles brighter

2482
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
what will happen

2483
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Thank you, teacher

2484
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
In fact, I am most grateful to the teacher

2485
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
are the last two birth control

2486
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
because

2487
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
technology is technology

2488
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Technology is still a cold thing

2489
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
of course

2490
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Because I think everyone who has a Ph.D.

2491
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Or in terms of senior intellectuals

2492
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
or in pursuit of domestic

2493
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
impact factor this piece

2494
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
in this speech today

2495
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I miss knowledge

2496
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
but i think

2497
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
is in this student's

2498
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
concern for humanity

2499
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
care for society

2500
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,000
that kind of warmth

2501
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,400
And the last epilogue is for all the scientists present

2502
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:06,400
Learning is the same

2503
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,400
Learning is the same

2504
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:08,400
The same goes for learning

2505
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,400
I have done twenty or thirty years of research

2506
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,400
Then my father passed away more than two years ago

2507
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,900
I spent more time with my mother after she passed away

2508
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:16,900
we're pissed off

2509
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:17,900
I told you earlier

2510
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:20,400
In fact, I have been so many years

2511
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,600
I later found out one thing

2512
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,900
I was younger when I was younger

2513
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:24,400
but i later found out

2514
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,900
Thieves won't suffer

2515
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,900
I won't suffer if I steal later

2516
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:31,300
be kind

2517
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,900
be kind to others

2518
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:36,200
Those who steal later will never suffer

2519
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,500
because you won't bother

2520
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,900
there will be a noisy trouble

2521
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,300
People will PASS you

2522
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:42,400
because he won't think of you

2523
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,600
because we have to call me Frankenstein

2524
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:48,000
It was when I was young that I used to wake up in the middle of the night

2525
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,700
suddenly in the middle of the night

2526
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:51,700
All of a sudden, I ran until it was dawn and came back

2527
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,400
Then slip wind I often disappear

2528
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:55,460
But then I got older

2529
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,700
Physical strength is also relatively poor

2530
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:59,300
But because of such a preference

2531
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,300
make animals

2532
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
That's how you like it, so you can avoid many disasters

2533
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Anyway, I don't have anything to say

2534
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Anyway, you do what I should do

2535
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
do it fast, for a piece of sky

2536
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Then there is a costume in my lab

2537
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
It's not a costume, it's a costume

2538
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
The person who is convinced, the most convinced person is the most convinced person

2539
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
I want students to understand this

2540
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
not only knowledge

2541
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
If you want to step on other people's shoulders

2542
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
that knowledge is false

2543
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
That is not true

2544
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
your knowledge is painted on the worst

2545
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
If so, that's not real knowledge.

2546
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
The real strength should be drawn on the high mouth

2547
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
draw on difficult problems

2548
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
That way you can make the best things

2549
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
please also

2550
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,600
If it is in the general aspect of art

2551
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,800
They are generally in the most color and texture life

2552
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,200
relatively high requirements

2553
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:10,400
In this part we are planning

2554
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,400
is the part that compares digits now

2555
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,800
Are there any humanities in this distance?

2556
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,600
It's like dividing those

2557
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:19,400
Tommy some experts to learn

2558
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,200
we no longer have

2559
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,800
all the singing is over

2560
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,200
Now just do the follow-up Maintain

2561
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,400
is to keep

2562
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,000
keep the original team

2563
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,200
But it's not already out of technology research and development

2564
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,000
Then the question you just mentioned is about a

2565
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,800
quality is the part of aesthetics

2566
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,800
Now it becomes a multimedia

2567
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,400
A notable part of the study

2568
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,200
we won't talk about quality anymore

2569
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,800
So they quantice this quality

2570
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,400
It is aesthetics that quantifies it

2571
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,800
So they can use a standard

2572
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,400
to some standards

2573
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,800
Isn't this thing beautiful?

2574
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,600
Of course I don't agree

2575
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,600
I think that's a bit lacking

2576
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:57,800
because everyone to everyone

2577
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,200
Everyone's opinion is different

2578
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,200
just look at a girl

2579
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
You don't necessarily think he's pretty.

2580
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Although my wife is not very good looking

2581
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
But I think when my wife is sixty

2582
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
He still has a good temperament

2583
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
that he won't change

2584
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
He is about the same age as 20 and 60

2585
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
But from a general aesthetic point of view

2586
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
From the point of view of most people's aesthetics

2587
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
he is not beautiful

2588
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
He can only be called my friend

2589
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Caller

2590
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
but

2591
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
But when people live to be fifty or sixty years old, sixty or seventy years old

2592
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
are old, right?

2593
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
no more ugly

2594
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
But the most important thing is this

2595
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
What's in your head is more important

2596
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
at that time

2597
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
sorry

2598
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
i didn't answer you

2599
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
That aesthetic is now being practiced by many people

2600
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
yes indeed

2601
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
but i didn't do that

2602
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I compare that

2603
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
more positive

2604
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
ok i have what to bring to answer the question

2605
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
come please

2606
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I think it's a follow-up question, please continue

2607
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
That is to say, as the teacher just showed a technique is considered

2608
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
The number of people in the video can be automatically added to a large number

2609
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
To see this matter, in other words, he can automatically

2610
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Watch a lot of videos and say how many people are there

2611
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
One question that comes to mind in this way is, are we right

2612
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
When you want to know a certain aspect of information when you want to know a certain aspect of information

2613
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
You have to think of another set of algorithms to be able to handle it.

2614
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Is there an algorithm that takes a

2615
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Or a lot of data with long digits, those

2616
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
In other words, it is equivalent to saying that it can be described in a relatively complete way.

2617
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
If I want to know the number of people, I have to trouble the teacher for ten years. Then I want to know the next day.

2618
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
where are these

2619
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I'm going to be busy doing two things

2620
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
yes i tell you

2621
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
to you...

2622
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
I actually... you take a closer look at what we've done

2623
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
In fact, it's all about engineering

2624
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But the problem of engineering does not mean that there will be no size in the middle

2625
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
what we can do

2626
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Because I've come this far

2627
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I know what I'm doing is an engineering problem

2628
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,000
is not a perfect field

2629
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
but i can only try

2630
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
for the survival of the students

2631
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
For the future of students

2632
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I have to be in the middle of the process of this project

2633
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
find a size

2634
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Let them learn some valuable things from the middle

2635
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
instead of black hands

2636
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Just use the Taoist calendar

2637
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
To solve the problem with engineering methods

2638
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
You solve the problem though

2639
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
But it is 0 in learning

2640
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
So we'll try to think of some

2641
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
During this process

2642
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Think of something scientific to infuse it

2643
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Raise the bar for this question

2644
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Because engineering problems you can use engineering methods to solve

2645
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
But in the middle, if you can use the scientific method to enter

2646
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
its bar will get higher

2647
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,360
It becomes higher when approaching two thresholds

2648
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,840
So I didn't count the things that were transferred out

2649
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,720
when i do it with this attitude

2650
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,760
there is a vendor

2651
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,960
He can't be called a master's or a doctor's manager

2652
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,600
Bring a few masters to do it

2653
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,480
he can't do it

2654
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,560
because the bar is high

2655
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,040
because he has something scientific

2656
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:15,760
There is Science in it

2657
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,200
That product is also relatively hidden.

2658
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,840
Just like our current Largan

2659
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,800
The reason why Largan makes so much money

2660
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,280
Only the first one he stayed in Taiwan

2661
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:27,800
The second one he used plastic instead of glass

2662
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,000
his cost is very low

2663
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,760
His technique is good

2664
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:34,240
So his world power is 50%

2665
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:36,760
Half of the lens is his whole world

2666
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,880
so he can be so good

2667
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,640
Then you'll know that Mitch

2668
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:45,360
his science stuff is there

2669
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,480
so he can

2670
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,400
was he originally a doctor

2671
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,800
this son took

2672
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:49,840
his father gave him

2673
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,360
this son is a doctor

2674
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,200
But he just jumped in and made Largan shots

2675
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,440
well-done

2676
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:57,280
the same reason

2677
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:59,120
He's supposed to do science stuff as well

2678
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,940
You do it on that joint for mental strength

2679
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:04,940
When doing science

2680
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:06,940
Your process is very valuable

2681
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:10,940
Why? Because it is not easy for others to surpass you

2682
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:12,940
so for students

2683
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,440
To everyone who works with you

2684
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,440
one of the best training

2685
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:17,440
because they are in a difficult

2686
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,440
like that diamond

2687
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,440
you are more stressed

2688
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,240
Are you a diamond again?

2689
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:22,940
you stress less

2690
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:24,940
become soil without pressure

2691
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:28,380
Excuse me

2692
01:42:28,380 --> 01:42:30,380
professor again

2693
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,380
if that old photo

2694
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,380
What about inventions like the one you just mentioned?

2695
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:40,380
Is there any software on the market that can fix it?

2696
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,380
actually don't know

2697
01:42:42,380 --> 01:42:44,380
I know it's possible to have software

2698
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:47,380
But I didn't actually look for those software

2699
01:42:47,380 --> 01:42:49,380
that maybe

2700
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:51,380
Because the technical threshold is not very high

2701
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:53,380
VDL is more difficult

2702
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,820
But Yiyiju

2703
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:57,820
Just saw that M-POP

2704
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
that we have given one to the archives office

2705
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That's what he did

2706
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
He needs an Aged Detection

2707
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
to catch Crees

2708
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
It's Crees stuff

2709
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
That Crees sometimes you catch

2710
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Because many things and clothes also have Crees

2711
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
also have boundaries

2712
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
so leave a space

2713
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
let these to study these

2714
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
ladies and gentlemen

2715
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
he doesn't know computer

2716
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
He doesn't have a Mouse

2717
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
to tick which are places

2718
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
is required

2719
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
After ticking

2720
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
The system will automatically

2721
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
kill him where it should be done

2722
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
he is borrowing

2723
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
What was carried off did him away

2724
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
ask you that again

2725
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
say in the computer

2726
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
the one of us

2727
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
there will be an editor or something

2728
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
then you go in and edit

2729
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
like just now you made that picture light up

2730
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
then we are on the computer

2731
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
After that and that light up

2732
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
there is no way like

2733
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
the thing we just showed

2734
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
we missed it

2735
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Yes, that, that, actually that

2736
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
too big a miss

2737
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
just one

2738
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
a Presentation

2739
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
that method

2740
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,460
He is actually the end result

2741
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:04,160
He just puts it out with the middle process

2742
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:05,160
That's not what I did

2743
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,500
That's my Postart

2744
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:07,460
bomb plus that bomb mode

2745
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:10,040
That Xiao Fenyu

2746
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,000
Mr. Xiao is here

2747
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,200
Universal Washington Seattle

2748
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:13,960
he did

2749
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:15,340
He is slowly showing it

2750
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:16,240
So the result he just had

2751
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:17,700
In the results report of the National Science Council

2752
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:18,640
there was a press conference

2753
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:20,500
I think we'll be clear

2754
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,540
Then we use that editor's

2755
01:44:22,540 --> 01:44:24,300
because what to do

2756
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,300
yes that's just a

2757
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,800
Presentation is just a method

2758
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:27,800
right

2759
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,740
Okay, thank you

2760
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,900
brightness brightness change

2761
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,580
He actually does repair work

2762
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,740
yes i just need a little bit out

2763
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:39,240
Yes I have people involved in a lot of restoration

2764
01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,440
any left

2765
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,940
I'm not like him

2766
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:50,140
I am very very thankful today

2767
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:52,440
drug researcher

2768
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:54,640
I think I should add

2769
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,940
is what he just presented

2770
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:57,640
he has many conclusions

2771
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:00,040
there is one more important thing

2772
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,600
It can be heard from his speech

2773
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:05,500
I could tell he was very, very interested

2774
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,000
all the things he does

2775
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,600
所以 everything is worth it

2776
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:14,000
ok thank you all for today

2777
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,400
then i now

2778
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,900

2779
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,800
