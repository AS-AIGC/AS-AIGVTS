1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
music

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
music

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
music

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
music

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
music

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
applause

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
music

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
good night everybody

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I actually took pictures of people for two weeks

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Looking forward to today too

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's see this crazy horse

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then I turned out to be Vice President Wang

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wang Fan is the vice president

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because of going abroad

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
so please let me take

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There are so many people present today

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I believe that everyone is interested in this topic

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
very very looking forward to

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then we also know that March

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This Matsu, this incense

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
is a big event in Taiwan

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I am very happy to invite Professor Zhang Xiong here today.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
come talk to us

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Reasons for All Taiwanese Matsu Beliefs

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Like change, I probably know Mazu

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This Mazu will nourish the home these activities

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know anything about his origins

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I am very excited about today's speech

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What about Dr. Zhang Xun, now he is

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ethnic Researcher and Deputy Director

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He is from the Department of Anthropology, National Taiwan University

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Bachelor and Master

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
During his bachelor's and master's

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Taiwanese folk medicine

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and religion etc.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
as the subject of his research

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then he went to Berkeley in the United States

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
get a doctorate

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
After returning to Taiwan, he continued

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Focusing on folk belief and folk medicine

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to continue research

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Of course, I did a lot of field research.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
we can listen carefully today

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Dr. Zhang is actually in the Department of Anthropology

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Probably anthropologists probably know him

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, he is still teaching human beings at National Taiwan University and National Chengchi University.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just found out when I was talking to him

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The Department of Anthropology in Taiwan has very few students studying anthropology

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Then his topic today is to talk about the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of youth

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He is based on this book called Tianfei Dangerous Road

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The basis here

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then he added his own research

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Then come and tell us all these origins and more

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I think I won't waste everyone's time

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
We are looking forward to Zhang Guoshi's speech

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Thanks

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Thank you, Vice President Wang, for your introduction

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Thank you colleagues in the hospital

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,280
And good friends outside the hospital

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,720
And our folks and elders in the Nangang area

61
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
I feel honored to be here

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Let me report my research over the past few years

63
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,520
Vice President Wang Fansheng About a month or two ago

64
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,720
Notify me when I'm coming to give this speech

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
I prepared a few topics for him to choose

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,040
Because this is a more general topic

67
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
I haven't been in touch for a long time

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,840
As a result, Vice President Wang Fansheng chose this topic

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
I think he probably also

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,360
because he is more experienced

71
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,800
He's served the feast of knowledge for a long time

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,160
So he knows better

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How can you resonate with the audience?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Choose an appropriate topic

75
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,000
So I finally chose this topic

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Feng Mazu

77
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,000
Then he explained to me that it is best to start from the most basic

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Because Taiwan's Mazu belief we know is very prosperous

79
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,500
But he wants me to start from this most basic source

80
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,700
History, development, and the transition to the present

81
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,500
make a report with everyone

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,500
So what I'm talking about today

83
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,300
If there are incomplete

84
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,200
Or you are in other parts of Taiwan

85
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Because of the Mazu belief in the North, Central and South

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,000
may be slightly different

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
What if something I said was incomplete?

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,000
Give me advice when we can exchange time again

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
then i will sit down and talk now

90
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,500
This is what we say is the one who sealed Mazu in March

91
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,200
Shawei Xiao Mazu

92
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
mean to say

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,100
Because March is probably Mazu's birthday

94
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,500
March 3rd

95
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,700
Are you before the third day of the third lunar month?

96
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,300
you can go everywhere

97
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,700
Mazu Temples around

98
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,600
you are from the north go south

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,800
Or people from your central part go to the south to enter the countryside

100
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,000
That's because the whole month of March

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,900
almost north and south

102
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,500
The big and small ones of the Mazu Temple I went to

103
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,100
there are many activities

104
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,900
Then the believers also enjoy it

105
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,200
So in Taiwan there is such a

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
That is to say, Little Mazu Shawei

107
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,500
That is in so many Mazu temples in Taiwan

108
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,100
probably at present

109
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,600
Now I release these three temples

110
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
only famous

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,600
What about these three temples in 2010

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,300
also from our Ministry of Culture

113
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,800
It is said that this is a national level

114
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,700
Intangible Cultural Heritage

115
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,100
So the Mazu Temple

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
it's not just religion

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
It has now become our Taiwan

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,160
items of intangible cultural heritage

119
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,800
look from the right

120
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,160
Baishatun Matsu enters the village

121
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,560
Does anyone know where Baishatun is?

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,800
ok, this one goes first

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,100
Yes, Miaoli Tongxiao

124
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,200
In the middle, Dajia Mazu enters the village

125
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,760
This is probably on TV

126
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,120
The media knows that everyone

127
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,560
There is this black and black person

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,460
The Beigang Chaotian Temple on the left

129
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,420
Do you know where it is?

130
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,120
Yunlin

131
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,960
Beigang Chaotian Palace, these three are very famous

132
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,460
then let me ask a little more

133
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,020
Enter the countryside and follow around into the countryside

134
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,820
follow win mazu

135
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,320
What's the difference

136
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,920
why our culture is different

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to choose these three

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,300
if all the same thing

139
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,800
why choose three

140
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes or no

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's the difference

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is more subtle

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is slightly different

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
wait a minute we will talk about

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you take Baishatun as an example for offering incense

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
His pilgrimage because he was from

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
he didn't make it that clear

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He is from Beigang

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
share it

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So he goes to Beigang to enter Hong Kong every year

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's like saying just go

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You can say this when you go back to your mother's house

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
belongs to say

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That big one

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wrap around into incense

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Because he used to be before 1987

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Dajia also went to Beigang to worship

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But in 1988

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He will no longer go to Beigang to enter Hong Kong

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And what?

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In 1988 he changed to Newport

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
after incense

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
he added those two words

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wrap around into incense

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
so you know the difference

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
When he went to Beigang

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He is still the same as Bai Shatun

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Jingxiang

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But after going to Newport

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Beidajia added two words himself

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
called around Jingjing Township

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
around quiet words

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
let's start with a little mention

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll talk about it later

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That is to say, a relatively high-ranking god

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
he went to his jurisdiction

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Or he went to the jurisdiction of a lower god

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to patrol

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
go around quiet

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
as if we now our chief

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
For example, the dean came to our Institute of Democracy

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Check out that jurisdiction

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's see if you are doing your research well.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So Dajia Mazu went to Xingang

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He thinks he's better than Newport's

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mazu is high

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So he went around the Newport

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
have this meaning

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
so he is above the name

190
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He added those two words

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,840
Then Beigang Chaotiangong only said that he was winning Mazu

192
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,780
This is because the first two Baishatun and Dajia

193
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,440
He is every year before March 23 baby

194
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
So set off to Beigang or Xingang every year

195
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,980
The time to enter the country is not certain

196
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,240
As long as it is March of the lunar calendar

197
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,720
But come back to your own temple

198
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
Must be before March 23

199
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,240
so we can live

200
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
It's for Mazu's birthday

201
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,840
But because Beigang Chaotiangong was in his own

202
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,840
Xia District

203
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
He beat Mazu himself

204
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,720
It's him himself in this

205
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,220
Within the range of Xia District

206
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,380
Write to Mail Street

207
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,880
So he didn't come to the country, so he didn't enter the country

208
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Beigang is already

209
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,120
he is the boss

210
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,620
He is the boss of many Mazu temples in Taiwan

211
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,620
So he doesn't need to go outside to the countryside

212
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,620
he doesn't go either

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,120
go around other borders

214
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,440
he himself

215
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,040
Gap is

216
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,800
They call that Ben South Port and Ben North Port

217
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,640
Because Beigang used to be

218
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,600
The other side of the district was probably called Bengang in the Qing Dynasty.

219
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Later, because of the flood, it was divided into two

220
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,880
Two halves, so it is called Bennangang and Benbeigang

221
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,080
ok so we

222
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,360
start with this

223
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,680
you know what to say

224
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,680
There are many Mazu temples in Taiwan

225
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,520
And the Mazu Temple in Taiwan

226
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
there are some disputes between

227
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,200
right

228
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
I've heard that there are some disputes

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,360
Okay, let's start with the name of the city

230
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,880
It is the beginning of explaining the name of Mazu

231
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,960
Generally we say worship Mazu

232
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,160
But you see a lot of temples

233
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,880
the name of the temple he wrote

234
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,560
It's about Thean Hou Palace

235
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,120
Then you look at him

236
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,760
those beautiful red lotus

237
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,400
or the whip

238
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,000
written above

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Our Lady of Heaven

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And many believers

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Especially when it comes to Beigang

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
he doesn't call mazu

243
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
not called diva

244
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He also does not call Our Lady of Heaven

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
he called uncle

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
uncle

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
call it a woman

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Po he means like grandma

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That girl?

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's rarely called like this in Taiwan.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Generally speaking

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
we say diva

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
In fact, in the 23rd year of Kangxi

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Because the private man was in Kangxi for 22 years

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Conquered Taiwan

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Then report to Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that is

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Because of the goddess Li Mo Niang

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
help me get this taiwan

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So I hope this Emperor Kangxi

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Feng Chi is the name of the goddess

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So Tianhou is Emperor Kangxi

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Only after the second wind is the Queen of Heaven

264
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,120
I didn't have this name before

265
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,200
That Mazu is a general folk name

266
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,720
what about my aunt

267
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,540
She is called aunt in Meizhou Island.

268
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,340
Mazu is called aunt

269
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,380
So this is a very

270
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,940
very personal teaching

271
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,020
It is to regard Mazu as one's own relatives

272
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,060
aunt like this

273
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,340
what about mother

274
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,880
yes generally yes

275
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,460
Minnan, a native of Fujian

276
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,600
A female name will be followed by a mother

277
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,980
So there are names like this

278
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,280
You will want to say Mazu

279
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,920
It doesn't matter whether this is mother or grandmother. Grandpa.

280
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,760
It's the name of a goddess, isn't it?

281
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,040
A little

282
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,060
like

283
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,600
Can't figure it out

284
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,160
It doesn't have his name on it either.

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
That can't be used to call other goddess mothers

286
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
Why is it called Mazu?

287
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,800
Ever wondered

288
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,000
you hit worship mazu

289
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
How could Mazu be called this name?

290
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
ever wondered

291
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,800
because we know nothing but to say

292
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Lin Moniang, her name is Mazu

293
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,400
We still have Chinese folk beliefs

294
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
many gods

295
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,200
We all use this relative to be called

296
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,800
You seem to say that the land lord calls him the lord

297
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
And that Mr. Ping called him Mr.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Then what about Beigong

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,800
The Hakka people call the Duke of Earth and the Duke of Bei.

300
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Then Guanyin Bodhisattva is called Guanyin Bodhisattva in Buddhism

301
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,000
But what is it called in folk belief

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,100
Avalokitesvara scolds

303
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Then the Buddha's four schools imitate the Buddha

304
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
In Buddhism, it is called the four imitation Buddhas

305
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,200
In folk belief it is called not to do

306
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
The ancestor came out

307
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
Avalokitesvara's scolding also came out

308
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,400
and some

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
those that

310
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
yes blue cow horse yes

311
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,320
The star worshiped on the Qixi Festival on July 7th

312
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Green cattle and horses

313
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
There's some left

314
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,440
Let me see if you can come up with an example

315
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,800
to make up for

316
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,040
Restock here

317
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
That's my mother-in-law

318
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
So sister also came out

319
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
then buddy

320
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,940
Brothers

321
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,140
He's not a honey boy, isn't he a ghost?

322
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
what do you call him brother

323
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
that's brother right

324
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,800
and some of that girl temple

325
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,740
That is to say, every girl who gets married dies

326
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,440
if she thinks nothing

327
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,600
Her temple can sometimes be called down

328
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,000
It's just that she usually scolds very effectively

329
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,100
also called her to scold

330
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,400
Actually she was a girl when she died

331
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,000
but how to curse

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
how to change scolding

333
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,600
Have you ever thought about these nouns

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
This is anthropologically

335
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,700
That is to say, the gods of Taiwanese folk beliefs

336
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,000
Because it bears the relative title of our Chinese

337
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,700
Then we know the gods of our folk beliefs

338
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,700
In addition to the natural gods such as the sun, the moon and the stars

339
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,500
Others are animal gods

340
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,800
look at our fresh lake

341
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,900
those animal gods

342
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,300
then there are some plant gods

343
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,300
The big ball palace, the big tree palace

344
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,800
There are also some artifact gods

345
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,100
That is to say, the door god, the god-maker

346
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,300
this utensil god

347
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,900
In addition, most of the gods of folk beliefs

348
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:43,200
People become gods after death, right?

349
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,900
Since it was a human being

350
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,200
So between it and believers

351
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,600
is that we compare with

352
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,800
if with christianity

353
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,600
Compared with Western Christianity

354
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,900
Chinese folk beliefs

355
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,000
Because its god is actually a human being

356
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But because he is a sage

357
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
His personality is more noble

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He deserves credit for national design

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So after his death he was

360
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Akabe

361
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Jade Emperor Red Bee

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It can also be killed by the emperor red bee

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Then he became a god

364
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So this kind of god, this kind of personality god

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It is a person who becomes a god after death

366
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Because he was the same as a human being during his lifetime

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So when we call him

368
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
respect him call him

369
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Scolding Bo Gong Back Back Gong Back

370
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
with this your relatives

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's a quasi-relative, a name like a relative.

372
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So there will be nouns like this

373
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
good

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes, because of Wen Zhugong

375
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The Xingtian Gong in Taipei worships

376
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Wu Enzu, you can also call him Duke Wenzhu

377
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,360
So if he becomes a god, it's early

378
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,640
You call him male because we know Lin Muliang

379
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,980
He became a god in the Song Dynasty until now

380
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,780
How could he not succeed after more than a thousand years

381
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,900
Scolding him can't be the solution

382
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,980
So this reflects another characteristic of folk beliefs

383
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,580
That is, after the god dies, he continues to age

384
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,820
Walking, he became a god in the Song Dynasty

385
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,440
But as of now AD 2014

386
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,280
Then we'll count how many years he's gone

387
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,280
he's in heaven he's still alive

388
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,600
So we'll count his age

389
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,400
Go on. He's probably still there.

390
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,900
still resting

391
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,680
ok, this is hard to press

392
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,680
wow i turned it off

393
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,160
Okay, let's talk about it, okay, I was just talking

394
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,520
Saying his name, why did he become Mazu?

395
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,840
Now let's talk about the century of his life

396
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,560
his original name

397
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,400
It's the name his parents gave him, Lin Mo

398
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,600
Only two words Lin Mo

399
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,720
Then we just mentioned that in Fujian, the southern part of Fujian

400
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,160
you just have to be a girl

401
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,440
Usually there will be a "Niang" on the back

402
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,000
For example, my name is Zhang Xun

403
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,960
But you don't know that this Zhang Xun is a girl to a boy

404
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,400
So when you die or write in the genealogy

405
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,440
Just add the word "mother", then you know that Zhang Xun is a woman

406
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,080
Look at Lin Mo

407
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
He can be a man or a woman. This name

408
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,920
you add a girl

409
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,080
So you say Mazu's name is Lin Mo

410
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,280
Or call it Lin Mo Niang, both are right

411
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,480
We are all

412
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,560
Then according to the book I mentioned in the introduction

413
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,720
A monk in the late Ming Dynasty and the early Qing Dynasty

414
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,880
a buddhist daughter

415
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Her name is Zhao Sheng

416
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,500
He said that the Tianfei who wrote it was in the book about Shenglu

417
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,500
In fact, there are many different versions of the book about Mazu

418
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,500
different opinions

419
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,500
But Mazu has never been included in this official history

420
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
is the official history

421
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
All these Mazu wrote holy roads

422
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Concubine Tian, ​​what mother passed on?

423
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Our Lady of Heaven English Yuanliu Examination Many

424
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,500
It's all folk notes

425
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's all folk

426
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then if the version is different

427
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
where they wrote his date of birth

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,500
parents' names

429
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Brothers have different names

430
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
That's why I said I'm going to order a copy

431
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,000
lest you mess up

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
but there are different versions

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If you are interested in those

434
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can also find another

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Well, write the Holy Road according to that concubine who made the saint

436
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,500
he is writing

437
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
What about Lin Mo, she started from birth

438
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
to the bright moon

439
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
full moon

440
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,100
We know that the Chinese have the ritual of doing the full moon?

441
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,900
when touched

442
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,940
never cried

443
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,500
Never cried from birth to full moon

444
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,540
That's why we call him Lingmo

445
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,600
don't cry, don't cry

446
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,920
Usually babies cry when they are born

447
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,460
he didn't cry

448
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,480
But

449
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,280
After Yagoshi

450
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,560
will speak

451
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,860
Don't say Mazu is dumb

452
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,160
someone said

453
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,000
Mazu is dumb, I was wrong, if according to this book

454
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,820
He just didn't cry when he was born to one month old

455
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,860
not that he was dumb afterwards

456
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,400
Otherwise, how can he save people?

457
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,420
Yes or no

458
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,200
so

459
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,000
This life is more unstable and more stable

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,600
Then he was born in the first year of Song Taizu Jiannong

461
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,120
March 23

462
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,320
Fujian

463
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,680
Fuden

464
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,760
death is in song taejoong

465
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,780
September 9th

466
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,080
Died on Meizhou Island

467
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,100
according to the book

468
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,020
Mazu's father's name is Lin Yuan

469
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,440
mother surnamed wang

470
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,480
The couple had a son

471
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,880
It's Mazu's elder brother named Hong Yi

472
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,920
There are Mazu and five older sisters

473
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,040
But what?

474
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,920
Lin Yuan's father

475
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,760
He is this Putian

476
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,360
It is Du Xunjian in Putian, Xinhua

477
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,680
Be a petty officer, something like a police chief now

478
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,000
He thinks I'm middle-aged and only have one son

479
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,920
What are you doing with so many daughters?

480
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,680
so many daughters are useless

481
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,880
only one son

482
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
So what about this mother, this Wang family?

483
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,280
still want to get pregnant

484
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,080
Let's see if I can have another son

485
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,640
Then this sub-dream in Guanpusa

486
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,400
after conception

487
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
He always thought it was a man

488
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,240
But then she was born Mazu

489
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
and then it's special

490
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
When Mazu was born?

491
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
what afternoon

492
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,160
this small

493
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Great light shines brightly, and then the world is full of foreign lands

494
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,200
There are many special phenomena

495
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,300
So he knew this daughter was probably special.

496
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,500
What about when Mazu was in her teens?

497
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,700
There is a Taoist priest

498
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,800
when passing by his house

499
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,000
I think Mazu is a very smart girl

500
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,300
I taught him some secrets

501
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,800
This is the Fulu, the painting of blessings, and the way of doing it.

502
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Then when Mazu was eight years old

503
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,500
Just into this private member of their dying family

504
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,900
read Confucian books

505
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,800
So it can be said that this Mazu belief is in this book

506
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,800
He integrated the beliefs of our traditional Chinese Confucianism, Secularism and Taoism

507
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,500
Inside, it's a foundation

508
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,800
That is to say

509
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,200
It is a basis for the belief in Mazu to be so widely approved

510
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,000
because most Chinese

511
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,100
You either believe in Confucianism or the world or the Tao

512
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,600
so all acceptable

513
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,100
Mazu is acceptable

514
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,800
ok, what about now

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Meizhou Island, let's take a look

516
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,080
This is the Meizhou Island that I have photographed in recent years

517
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,040
We know that during the Cultural Revolution, the CCP

518
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,280
Destroy all, almost all temples

519
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,720
If it is not destroyed, it will also be confiscated

520
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,800
It's a warehouse, an army barracks, a factory or a hospital.

521
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,960
Although Meizhou Island is off the mainland, it is on the sea

522
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,560
But it was also not allowed to worship at that time

523
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,040
The whole island is occupied by the army

524
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:46,920
So now this temple hat is all see you later

525
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,520
Probably only this part, this is the original temple

526
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,760
These are all newly built next to this

527
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,920
That was around 1970

528
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
there is one

529
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,880
The old lady of Meizhou Island

530
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,940
she has a sense

531
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,840
that is

532
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,280
She started to pray by herself

533
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,040
Later, with the consent of the garrison army

534
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,440
And it's on the mainland of Fujian

535
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,380
Some CCP cadres agree

536
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,680
So slowly preserved the temple without damage

537
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,380
It was not destroyed during the Cultural Revolution

538
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,900
Now such a big conquest

539
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,620
Renovation and new construction

540
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,860
All Taiwanese believers donate money

541
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,660
mobilized

542
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,860
So this is one of Taiwan's religions going back

543
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,900
A big change for their local

544
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:59,940
Okay, if you have sharper eyes

545
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,240
You can see the birthplace

546
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,540
When we went in the early years

547
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,580
There is no big incense burner in front

548
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,580
And the three small incense burners above

549
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
three legs

550
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,640
this is later

551
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,580
Later home

552
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,380
It was just this big rock

553
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,580
Then

554
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,580
It is marked that Mazu is in

555
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,580
Born in Meizhou Island

556
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,080
But is Mazu from Meizhou Island?

557
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,280
It has been the study of Mazu in the mainland

558
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,780
This has become a school

559
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,180
scholars

560
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,780
a point of contention

561
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,120
What is Mazu

562
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,820
Kamata

563
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,880
That is to say, in mainland China, Fujian

564
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,520
What about people in Kamata?

565
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,080
Or is he from Meizhou Island?

566
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,840
no way

567
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,280
they quarreled

568
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,020
These scholars quarreled

569
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,820
no definite evidence to prove

570
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,380
but

571
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,880
Death is death on Meizhou Island

572
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,460
This is probably everyone's workers

573
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,900
but raw words

574
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,300
we can only say

575
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,300
live in Kamata

576
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Because Meizhou Island also belongs to Kamata County

577
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,600
because you see the ones in front of you

578
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,700
notebook novel

579
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,540
Local rule, local death

580
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,300
It is written that it was born in this

581
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,800
Min, Fujian

582
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,300
but not sure

583
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,100
So it's probably a certainty to be born here.

584
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,600
But life is

585
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,800
born on the island

586
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Or was it born on this land in Fujian?

587
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,100
it's not sure

588
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,300
Then what I show you is here

589
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,400
this

590
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,800
photo

591
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
don't know

592
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,800
has anyone been there

593
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,500
good

594
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,000
you can say this

595
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,500
next to this

596
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,800
The photo didn't come out

597
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,100
old temple

598
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,000
old temple

599
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,300
good

600
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,300
anyone else thought of

601
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,800
none of you went

602
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,100
Those who haven't raised their hands haven't been there

603
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
no, not footprints

604
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:11,600
There's a small entrance here.

605
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,300
Then here it is 10 yuan if you put it together

606
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,100
Here is a small space

607
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,200
You can hide inside, it's that simple

608
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I didn't pay attention at first

609
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Later, I found out why the teacher had some female believers hiding inside.

610
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,700
Later, because there was no room for two people

611
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
so wait till the next one

612
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,300
I have a picture and someone else can come out and see it

613
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
When he squeezes out like this

614
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,600
I also squeezed in to see what was inside

615
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,500
found that he is a small platform

616
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,100
Then there is a small incense burner inside

617
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,200
Then I'll watch it, squeeze in and finish watching.

618
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
i need to get out

619
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,700
Because there will be someone waiting behind

620
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,100
I just watch what they're doing

621
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,400
what about the women believers

622
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,600
What about after she got in?

623
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,900
she's over there

624
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Difficult to talk a lot

625
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,040
Let's talk, just talk to Mazu again

626
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,840
So we can imagine

627
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,120
This should be a custom of their Meizhou Island

628
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,480
for example

629
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,680
Since Mazu ascended to heaven

630
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,600
this place may really become a shrine

631
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,960
He is offering a woman believer

632
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,680
A place to communicate with Mazu

633
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,120
you see you hide in

634
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,240
if you don't look carefully

635
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,640
you don't notice someone is here

636
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,200
I used to say that when I went there in 1987

637
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,120
I don't have this incense burner yet

638
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,560
just a big rock

639
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,560
Even the red word was added later

640
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,120
Trace it in red

641
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,520
So that means

642
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,120
During the Cultural Revolution, no one noticed

643
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,680
There are still some religions secretly going on here

644
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,960
activities of faith

645
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
So this Mazu belief is like this

646
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,200
get down

647
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,760
I use this to illustrate

648
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,000
Compared with just so big, so red tail

649
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,540
The palace here also has this small

650
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,280
A private place for believers to communicate with Mazu

651
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,660
Because of a religious belief it will be passed down

652
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,360
have both

653
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,000
There must be a big, public, national, official, legal, and recognized

654
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,040
But there must be believers who can complain

655
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,240
A place where you can communicate with the gods, both of which are indispensable

656
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,400
Okay, so this one is after 1987

657
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,440
We are not talking about the statue of Mazu

658
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,240
Are most of them destroyed?

659
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
That's new

660
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,240
This shape is from Xiamen

661
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,640
A professor at the Art Department of Xiamen University

662
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,740
Called Levi's, he designed

663
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,240
This Mazu looks like

664
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
You generally have seen the statue of Mazu, right?

665
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
What is the difference between our Mazu statues?

666
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
written in Guangdong

667
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
ok, write again

668
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
western roots

669
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
he did it

670
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
he came

671
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
right

672
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And then there's his what

673
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
900,000 yuan pig

674
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
usually last able to cover

675
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
stay free

676
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
yes very good

677
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
This one came prepared

678
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Also, and

679
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Listeners here, let me see

680
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Have you seen

681
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
We are usually in Taiwan

682
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
what you saw in the temple

683
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Different statues of Mazu

684
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Clam

685
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What

686
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
what did the guest say

687
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
girly look

688
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
yes, his face

689
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
not the same

690
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
correct

691
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
color difference

692
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
color difference

693
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What are most of Taiwan's Mazu

694
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
black face even if not black face

695
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
All in all a blur

696
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And even if it's not a blur

697
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
the hat he was also covered in

698
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
embroidered hat

699
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And the exemption that the gentleman just said

700
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's the concubine

701
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The emperors who passed the tradition to China

702
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
he has these

703
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
because all the gods form

704
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
In traditional China is the era of emperors

705
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This era with the imperial system of emperors

706
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
is regulated

707
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
what can you take

708
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
what are you holding

709
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
what animals can be ridden on feet

710
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and the clothes you're wearing

711
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
wear on head

712
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
there are rules

713
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's all stipulated by Ribo

714
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Equal to our current Ministry of Culture

715
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
stipulated

716
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
you can't mess around

717
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
If you mess around, you will be an evil god

718
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Then your temple is hidden words

719
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I can send the army to tear you apart

720
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Then his appearance is indeed similar to ours.

721
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What we saw in Taiwan Mazu Temple is different

722
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
one is color

723
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Normally gods don't make white

724
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
white is the color of chinese party

725
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Then why is the Mazu dancing statue in Taiwan

726
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
easy to turn black

727
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
blackened

728
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
i have hinted

729
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
what i said already implied

730
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
easily blackened

731
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
blackened why

732
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Why don't you clean him up every year?

733
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
right

734
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Because if Mazu's face is black,

735
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It means he's obsessed

736
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
so many cigarettes every day blackened him

737
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
how can i wash it off

738
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
like there's a joke that says

739
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
That teapot you make tea every day

740
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Isn't there the word tea in it?

741
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
do you want to wash him off

742
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Of course not

743
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
The teapot is useless after washing

744
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
because of your accumulation

745
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That is the historical value accumulated over the years.

746
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
antiques are over there

747
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Mazu statue in Taiwan

748
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
You said 200 years, how do you prove it

749
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,600
If you take out a century-old Mazu

750
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
No one will believe her for 200 years, right?

751
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,680
Well, there is one more thing this gentleman said just now.

752
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,880
He is standing, Taiwan's Mazu

753
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,440
You don't stand in the temple, do you?

754
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,120
Then why doesn't our Mazu stand up

755
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,080
Mazu in Taiwan does not stand

756
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,920
Don't you see farther by standing?

757
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,080
do it kindly

758
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
so how

759
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
to sit

760
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
yes he is standing or sitting

761
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It also involves where he sits, right?

762
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
If you sit because there is no line below

763
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
is on the top of the mountain

764
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
at the top of the mountain at the top of the mountain

765
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's weird sitting on top of a mountain, isn't it?

766
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
like our

767
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,340
Our Powerpoint cut off my left and right

768
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,000
Just now that one is missing that, now this one is missing this

769
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,700
The statue of Mazu is over here

770
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,840
It is the highest point in the entire Meizhou Island

771
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,300
The highest point on the island stands here

772
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,600
as a landmark

773
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,640
as their landmark

774
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,240
Because even if the CCP does not ban Mazu belief now

775
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,240
but it does not endorse popular belief

776
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,600
You know its religious policy is

777
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,840
only legal five religions

778
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,700
Folk beliefs are not legal religion

779
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,980
But in Fujian it is to open the heart

780
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,140
Welcome the return of Taiwan compatriots

781
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,600
It barely makes the Mazu belief in folk belief

782
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,540
Just fight with one eye and close one eye

783
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,700
otherwise

784
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,300
It could be Mazu belief in mainland China

785
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,960
Comparing is considered a cultural practice

786
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,600
So as a landmark, the shape just now serves as a landmark

787
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,900
that i said

788
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,500
The design by Professor Li Weishi from the Art Department of Xiamen University

789
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,300
another one

790
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,600
you both mentioned

791
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,660
He is carved in white granite

792
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,520
Generally, our Mazu beliefs do not use stones to carve

793
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,840
don't use stone to carve

794
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,680
Stone to carve can Buddha Bodhisattva in Buddhism

795
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,980
Gods not in Taoism

796
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,280
Taoism

797
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,820
We know that the gods of Taoism should be consecrated

798
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:40,200
Consecrate the inside of that idol

799
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,480
to put five treasures

800
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,800
Right, the statue is on the back of the statue

801
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,880
Before sealing it, you need to put five treasures

802
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,420
five precious gold

803
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,760
The picture of Jinmu fruit, that is realized, we need to put another one

804
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,360
raw worm or bee

805
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,920
This makes that god like animate

806
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,600
Then, believers are communicating with the idol

807
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,400
You said that you communicate with stones, what is the difference between pillars and wood

808
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,200
What is the difference between statues carved out of trees and statues carved out of stone?

809
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,000
There is a difference because

810
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,400
It's more sensitive

811
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,100
This anthropology in this around the world

812
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,600
study of gods

813
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,200
If using stones use this

814
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,200
What kind of stainless steel is that? Use this

815
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,700
It means that gold and steel are not bad, it means that this Buddha

816
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,800
it is a long time obsessed

817
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,400
it is long but with

818
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,200
like communication

819
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,100
like hinduism

820
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,000
What you want is a sense, a sense

821
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,700
The induction between believers and God is Response

822
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,800
trees are alive

823
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
alive, alive

824
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,200
Trees

825
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
With stone it won't...

826
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,700
If it is a stone, it will not be blackened

827
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,100
the trees will be blackened

828
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,300
because it will go out

829
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,100
trees will die

830
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,800
so just that

831
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
The shape of the statue of Mazu

832
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,700
we just know

833
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,800
Mazu belief is now in mainland China

834
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
regarded as a landmark

835
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,100
A symbol of cultural tourism

836
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,000
anything else

837
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,200
sea ​​peace goddess

838
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,600
Mazu was in 1989

839
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,400
called by the Chinese Communist Party

840
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
sea ​​peace goddess

841
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
the goal is clear

842
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,800
To maintain peace across the Taiwan Strait

843
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,600
standing over there

844
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,200
where are his eyes looking

845
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,700
I will go to...

846
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,500
go to that...

847
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,900
look carefully below

848
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,400
Just looking towards Beigang

849
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,500
Just looking at Taiwan

850
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,200
He wants to recruit Taiwan

851
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
Recruit Taiwan compatriots

852
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Wait a moment

853
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We will finally put a POPPO inside

854
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,800
The roof of Chaotian Temple in Beigang, Taiwan

855
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,500
There is also a statue of Mazu that is exactly the same

856
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,800
Two statues shaking each other

857
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,500
ok , now let ' s talk about this

858
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,200
Okay, then this is the Mazu who gave the loan

859
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,800
Originally, I could only get this in Taiwan

860
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,300
Just turn around, I don't know who gave me a talisman

861
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,800
Then you see what the small lettering on it says

862
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,600
yes , your eyes are fine

863
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,000
can pass that vision test

864
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,100
Wenfeng Palace in Putian, Fujian

865
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:59,900
Then because of the convenience of the cross-strait connection, after going to the mainland

866
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I'll go and see

867
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
This is really inside Wenfeng Palace in Putian, Fujian

868
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
A statue of Mazu enshrined

869
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You can see that his appearance is also different from the current Taiwanese Mazu

870
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You see he is also carved in stone

871
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And then he didn't have the nine exemptions just now.

872
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Not wearing a hat either

873
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This is the shape of Mrs.

874
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Mazu in Song Dynasty

875
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
We remember that we just said that Tianhou was only conferred in the 23rd year of Kangxi

876
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
In the Song Dynasty, when Mazu had just passed away

877
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Didn't he accumulate his merit so quickly?

878
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So he was conferred the title of wife by the emperor

879
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So in the Song Dynasty, his shape was that of a lady

880
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
ok then let's talk about it now

881
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
How does Mazu gradually accumulate his magical machine

882
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And slowly push his status up

883
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,400
His team's magical machine is based on the record of the appearance of the concubine

884
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,400
These 16 are from his lifetime

885
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,200
He began to show his magical power, power, and spiritual power while he was alive.

886
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,300
his ability

887
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:19,000
Because didn’t he get some secret techniques from Taoist priests?

888
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,400
Then he can defend the prophet

889
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,500
So we won't talk about these one by one

890
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,300
Among them, for example, the old relative on the plane is the second one.

891
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,600
Whoops

892
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,500
I'm so sorry

893
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,200
I'm not familiar with this

894
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,600
The old relative on the plane is

895
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:44,900
The first one who was blessed by the police was the Xuan Taoist who took him to the blessing of the police.

896
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,600
Go to the wells one by one

897
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,000
See the word floating up inside

898
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
This, this, these are the blessings, heavenly scriptures, and words drawn.

899
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,200
Then the old kiss on the plane is the girl he asked for in the past

900
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,000
want

901
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Then one day when Mazu was imitating

902
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
His original spirit went out to sea

903
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
because he heard his father and brother

904
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
They are all in the countryside

905
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
not the country

906
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
their fishing village

907
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
father and brother are fishermen

908
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
fishing outside

909
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
his original god out

910
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Seeing his father and brother is a disaster

911
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
inside the shipwreck

912
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
so he saved his father

913
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
But there is no way to save my brother

914
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
so his brother

915
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
If you can't save it, you will die

916
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
but saved his father

917
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And there are many stories in the myth

918
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
That Mazu can subdue these

919
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Ghost, Dragon King

920
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And Yan Palace is their southern Fujian

921
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Poseidon

922
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
was also subdued by him

923
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So actually before Mazu

924
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
There are sea gods all over China

925
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
God of water, god of river, right?

926
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
God of Rain and Friends of Water

927
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But Mazu subdued them one by one

928
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So get yourself up

929
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,500
Up to now, most of us worship Matsu

930
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,000
Then the two ghosts Jiaying and Jiayou

931
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It's the Clairvoyant Shunfeng we worship now

932
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
was also subdued by him

933
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
because these two monsters

934
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
At sea is always doing bad things

935
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So let the fishermen have no peace

936
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Also received by Matsu

937
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
After speaking is after Mazu was born

938
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
There are more than thirty miracle stories

939
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
They are all accumulated in the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties.

940
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
different

941
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The ones above here are probably from the Song Dynasty.

942
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Then from here

943
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Nu Tao Ji Ruo this is probably the Yuan Dynasty

944
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Because the Yuan Dynasty had the Grand Canal

945
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
then over here you see

946
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Taijian Zhenghe belongs to the Ming Dynasty

947
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
then to the qing dynasty

948
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Here, the latter three are related to Taiwan.

949
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Then we will talk about it later

950
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So in that book

951
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
You can see a more detailed account of these myths

952
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
So Mazu belief will be so prosperous

953
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
has its social background

954
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The first one was Mazu in the Song Dynasty

955
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
We say he had some mana in life

956
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
So he's accumulated some miracles

957
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
after he left

958
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
you see him in the country

959
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
small do not say

960
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
The small one is, of course, that he often has

961
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Putting down the Han disaster brought some water

962
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
large at the national level

963
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
You see when he sends scriptures to battle

964
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
He helped the army of the Song Dynasty

965
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
be able to return safely or in blood

966
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Then during the Yuan Dynasty we knew

967
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The newly built Grand Canal Chaoyun will bring this south of the Yangtze River

968
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Lost to Hebei

969
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,600
all apparition

970
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,000
let this morning luck

971
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
very flat

972
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,500
arrived safely

973
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,600
Then when Ning Dynasty

974
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,400
the most important is

975
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,500
Zhenghe's seven voyages to Nanyang

976
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,000
The Western Ocean written here is Nanyang

977
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,300
All are blessed by Mazu

978
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,800
Then it came to the Qing Dynasty

979
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,700
the biggest thing

980
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,200
is to overcome Taiwan

981
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,800
good

982
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,000
from

983
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
From this road in the Song Dynasty

984
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,500
enemy is an ambassador

985
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,000
it's time to die

986
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,300
his ship was shipwrecked

987
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,100
It was Mazu who saved him

988
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,200
Then the battle between the two armies that sent gold

989
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:44,400
Then to the Yuan Dynasty and so on

990
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,100
So in what I just mentioned

991
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,200
Zhao Sheng is the monk

992
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,800
A monk in the Qing Dynasty called Zhao Sheng

993
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,300
In the book he wrote,

994
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,400
can see this mazu

995
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,500
He has seen miracles

996
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,000
so his official title

997
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,600
Sealed one by one, we will show you his name later

998
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,800
So his faith slowly spread from Putian, Fujian

999
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,400
To the north, to the south, to the whole of China

1000
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,800
And because of Zheng He, he also went to Southeast Asia

1001
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,200
The entire Mazu belief

1002
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:23,300
Zheng He Xia Xiyang, look at the part he wrote about Zheng He

1003
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,200
Then this is another book, because he heard that Fei Shenglu's writing is not so detailed

1004
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,900
I used another book's

1005
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,100
that is

1006
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,200
Gubu is Goufu, this talk is Goufu

1007
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,500
In the first year of Yongle, Taijian Zheng and he went to Xianluo, which is now Thailand

1008
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,100
After that, Kyoto University Shinyo

1009
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,400
His boat was about to capsize, Zheng He just prayed silently

1010
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,200
I suddenly heard the sky and the moon floating in the sky

1011
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,600
I seem to see it, I seem to see it

1012
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,900
God, standing on that stern

1013
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,440
top and then immediately calm down

1014
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,940
After returning, he told the emperor

1015
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,360
Then the emperor asked the former officials to worship this

1016
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,440
Mazu, so seven times later this Zheng and Xia Xiyang

1017
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,320
Every time before he goes to sea, he is in that Fujian

1018
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,920
A port next to Fuzhou is called Changle Port

1019
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,560
Every time he goes to sea, he first worships this Mazu

1020
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,300
Then we also know that in Southeast Asia

1021
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,460
About Zhenghe's century and some place names left by him

1022
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,340
a lot that equals

1023
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,860
There are also scholars in Malaysia

1024
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,540
Survey of Mazu Belief Block 46

1025
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,980
Except Malaysia Indonesia Singapore Thailand

1026
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,980
There is Tianfei Temple, Tianhou Temple

1027
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,820
It can be said that as long as this is where the Chinese go

1028
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,900
or this overseas immigrant

1029
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:00,040
Probably will bring Mazu

1030
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,840
After being on the boat and landing safely on the shore?

1031
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,140
Just take the little Mazu on the boat

1032
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,280
Just build a small temple and wait until you have the ability again

1033
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,840
Then slowly expand the temple

1034
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,940
Therefore, in the study of Chinese immigrants, Chinese are overseas.

1035
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,200
It is said that Mazu belief or Mazu Temple

1036
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,500
almost like a

1037
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:27,140
How to say this indicator is a sign

1038
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:29,000
If you see a Mazu Temple in this place

1039
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,100
Of course you are sure there is a Chinese community here

1040
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,680
It is a bit like the spread of our current Christianity

1041
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,600
where is western culture

1042
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,280
Its church is built wherever it is, right?

1043
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,840
What about before the Ming and Qing Dynasties?

1044
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,140
Chinese culture Han people's culture

1045
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,440
where to

1046
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,740
Where will the Mazu Temple follow?

1047
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,300
So then I had the opportunity to go to America

1048
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,340
go somewhere else

1049
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,400
I just watched his China Town

1050
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,440
to see his Mazu Temple

1051
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,380
Guangdong in the early days

1052
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Now they are all brought by Taiwanese to Matsu Temple

1053
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
So you can also see different dynasties, different immigrants

1054
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Wave after wave, they built different Matsu temples

1055
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Okay, but in the Qing Dynasty, this private man attacked Taiwan

1056
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Register with these three stories

1057
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Kangxi was a private man for 21 years and 22 years

1058
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Get Tianfei's help when fighting Taiwan

1059
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So in 22 years after he conquered the hut

1060
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Immediately, political and economic surrender in Taiwan

1061
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So tomorrow is over

1062
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The Qing Dynasty got Taiwan

1063
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So we say that Taiwan is in the whole of China

1064
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
There are several reasons why Mazu belief is the most popular

1065
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The first one is because you immigrated to Taiwan from Fujian

1066
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
You want to cross the sea, so you probably want to worship Mazu

1067
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Second, after you come to Taiwan

1068
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,840
From now on, you will first settle on this coast

1069
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,360
on the west coast

1070
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,520
Haven't turned to the back mountain, Taitung, Hualien

1071
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,680
You are on this coast from south to north

1072
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:15,320
From Tainan Chiayi Changhua Lugang

1073
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,440
All the way to Guandu in Taipei

1074
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,520
You still rely on the sea in this coastal area

1075
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,960
So you still worship Mazu

1076
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,280
Plus you look at this official

1077
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,800
The official initiative

1078
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,800
The belief in Mazu was introduced to Taiwan

1079
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,080
The earliest belief in our Mazu

1080
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,440
came through Penghu

1081
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,440
Because of course you are from mainland China

1082
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,040
To get to Taiwan, you have to go through Penghu first.

1083
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,440
So the Tianfei Palace in Penghu

1084
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,280
Now of course it's called Thean Hou Palace

1085
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,280
was the earliest in our gorges

1086
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,640
Inside the Gap of the Republic of China

1087
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:55,400
The Tianfei Palace in Penghu is the earliest

1088
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,440
Then there is this in the island

1089
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,760
The advertisement is now Chiayi Budai

1090
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
There is Tianfei Palace Tianfei Palace in the south of Antai

1091
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And Lulmen, Kaohsiung District, this is early

1092
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
After the Qing Dynasty, this is probably the end of the Ming Dynasty

1093
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
After the invasion, all the Matsu temples I saw in Taiwan

1094
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
More than the total number of Mazu temples in mainland China

1095
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Mazu is the patron saint of Taiwan

1096
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Then this is related to the entry of the private man into Taiwan

1097
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Because after his 22 years of class

1098
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Emperor Kangxi criticized his private son, saying that he was of the fourth public class

1099
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Because of the people in front

1100
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
His teacher, the private man's teacher can't beat him even if he bites

1101
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Private man because he is a subordinate of Zheng Chenggong

1102
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But his family was killed by Zheng Chenggong

1103
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
so he wants revenge

1104
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Then he knows the strategy of political success

1105
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And the Ministry of Defense at sea

1106
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So he can successfully defeat the government

1107
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
rather than politics

1108
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Because it has come to his son political economy

1109
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
so he's proud

1110
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
But when the private man heard

1111
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,600
Until Emperor Kangxi wrote about him

1112
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,160
He can't be proud

1113
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,040
Hurry up and say this is the help of Mazu

1114
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,240
So it can be said that he is

1115
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,680
Then under the Chifeng of Emperor Kangxi

1116
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,640
Mazu was named the highest queen

1117
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,200
Because Si Lang is afraid that he will be the master of his own achievements.

1118
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,520
Because you want to talk if Shiro is famous

1119
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,480
defected to the Qing Dynasty

1120
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,280
If he follows the example of the dignified and proclaims himself king in Taiwan

1121
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,440
Kangxi is tired

1122
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,880
He wants to send another general to beat him

1123
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,040
Tired

1124
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,480
So if Shiro wants to say

1125
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,040
I got help from Mazu

1126
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,040
Then Emperor Kangxi is a bit like this

1127
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,040
This is one of Chinese politics and religion

1128
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,600
often appear

1129
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,040
the emperor borrowed

1130
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,900
Chifeng is a god

1131
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,900
Include this place

1132
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,900
good

1133
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,200
and what about this place

1134
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,700
No matter Taiwan or Fujian or Guangdong

1135
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,100
you want

1136
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,700
become

1137
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,800
part of chinese culture

1138
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,700
is your local god

1139
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,300
accepted by the emperor

1140
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,900
enter this

1141
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,700
The system of gods in the Central Plains

1142
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,300
Ministry of Rites

1143
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,800
inside four o'clock

1144
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,800
So it's a two-way

1145
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,500
that is

1146
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,700
The Gods of Political Incorporation

1147
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,400
It means that politics has included your place

1148
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,600
that's what it means

1149
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,100
good

1150
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,100
then we will

1151
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,500
Introduce a few titles of Mazu

1152
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,400
he from

1153
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,200
What about after Mazu died?

1154
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,200
Slowly seal him from Song High School

1155
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,500
because he is not

1156
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,800
Assist Song and Jin in the war

1157
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And then you see, at first it was all just Mrs.

1158
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
At this time, the lady has become a concubine

1159
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Become a concubine and then arrive at the Yuan clan

1160
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
become a concubine

1161
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Na Hongwu

1162
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
At the time of Hongwu, the holy concubine and then

1163
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
In the 19th year of Kangxi, she was still called Tianfei

1164
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
But in twenty-three years, because of Shi Lang's relationship

1165
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Become him a diva, here's a jump

1166
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
It is to jump up Mazu's godhood to the highest level

1167
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
all the goddesses all

1168
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Among the gods of Han people's folk beliefs, the most abundant god is Tianhou.

1169
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Then the fifty-ninth year of Kangxi

1170
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
be able to program it into four o'clock

1171
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
That is, the whole of China, as long as it is the Qing Dynasty

1172
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
China ruled by

1173
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Everything is fine, as long as there are believers in the temple built in your place

1174
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
You can watch the place and sacrifice yourself in Spring and Autumn

1175
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
can make this budget

1176
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Officials can compile this budget

1177
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Then he is the last, Mazu's last title

1178
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That is, in pastoral care for eleven years at the same time

1179
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
How many words do you look at

1180
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I did a good job of calculating it before I came here.

1181
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
sixty-two characters

1182
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Then it was at this time, comrade

1183
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
According to the regulations of the Ministry of Rites, no more

1184
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
No one can carry it down

1185
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
These are sixty-two characters

1186
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Right, you can add another sixty-four characters, no, no

1187
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So this is the rule of the Ministry of Rites and cannot be added.

1188
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
In the future, you can say that he is great

1189
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
He still has centuries of his constant apparitions

1190
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
But the emperor just can't add words

1191
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
a group of four characters a group of four characters

1192
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
A group of four characters is

1193
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's all because he has a certain apparition and contributed to the country

1194
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
A group of four characters like this

1195
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
So this is the last one and it won't change

1196
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I can't hold it anymore, I can't add it anymore

1197
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,500
Okay, myths and rituals about Mazu

1198
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,000
We know that there is clairvoyance

1199
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Then he also subdued a lot of this fish, turtle, turtle, turtle essence

1200
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Vincent Rescue

1201
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Besides, in terms of his rituals

1202
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
There is this incense owner

1203
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Owner, what I just explained

1204
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
You now understand why gods want owners

1205
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
The god is not the mother of the god, why do you want the owner

1206
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Because the gods of the Chinese people, the gods of folk belief are the same as people

1207
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
So although Mazu became a god

1208
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But he still has to go back to see his grandparents

1209
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
ancestor

1210
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So also the owner

1211
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Then there are others, these are all about Taiwan now

1212
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Zheng Chenggong is going to court, 1661

1213
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
When going to Taiwan from Nan'an, Fujian, passing through Xiamen

1214
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
At that time, the Dutch occupied Taiwan

1215
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Then he went ashore again from Lu Ermen

1216
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The sea never rises and cannot enter the shore

1217
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
He worships this Mazu

1218
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Then after the sea buried

1219
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
All the ships of his army may enter the port of Lummon

1220
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So then he

1221
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
But this is all

1222
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
If you go to Lu Ermen to know

1223
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
There are two Mazu temples over there

1224
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
One is called Notre Dame Temple and the other is called Tianhou Temple

1225
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
The two temples quarreled about who was the best gift

1226
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Mazu

1227
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
This is really the most special part of Taiwan's Mazu belief.

1228
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
There are always two temples to contend for

1229
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Who is he

1230
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
That's like Dajia's mother, Chen Weiyu's mother said

1231
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
When he wakes up in March, it starts to rain

1232
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,840
It just so happens that spring sowing needs rain

1233
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,640
So all the farmers welcome this Yuyu?

1234
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,240
Then, like this white sand bucket that lasted all night

1235
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,640
Because there was no Hilo Bridge before

1236
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,000
You really have to walk across the Zuoshui River

1237
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,840
After the Hiro Bridge

1238
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,800
No one would be so stupid as to walk Zuoshui River

1239
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,240
But it was around 2008

1240
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,240
The first one we just had

1241
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,080
What you see on Powerpoint is that

1242
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,280
White Sand Bucket book cover

1243
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,960
Wait a minute, we brought a few copies and will give them to everyone

1244
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,120
The cover is those believers carrying the bridge

1245
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,440
Just walk down to Zuoshui River

1246
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,960
Later, because we also had colleagues to follow

1247
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,080
I didn't leave that time

1248
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,760
They said that they really fully experienced the ancestors

1249
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,160
your ancestors

1250
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,880
The road to the countryside is hard and dangerous

1251
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,740
What's more, let alone coming to Taiwan from Fujian

1252
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,060
how dangerous is that

1253
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,100
Because Zuoshui River is basically dry now.

1254
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:12,240
no water

1255
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,580
but still terrible

1256
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,040
Even now there is no water in Sasui Creek

1257
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,360
nothing to be afraid of

1258
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,760
still terrible

1259
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,700
Our colleague goes down

1260
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,140
He said

1261
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,360
because of the river bed

1262
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,740
You walk by, of course there is sand

1263
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:48,500
until the center of the river

1264
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,260
There's mud under there

1265
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,140
and that mud will go

1266
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,440
will flow

1267
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,940
so you put your foot down

1268
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,660
you don't know how deep it is

1269
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,700
And then bring a little water without being completely dry

1270
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,760
your body can move

1271
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,360
But you can't step on it

1272
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,040
you can't step on it

1273
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,460
so it's dangerous

1274
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,960
What's more, when there was a lot of water

1275
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,440
Now because Taiwan is relatively dry

1276
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,560
no water

1277
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,900
so it's scary

1278
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:17,400
in those days they

1279
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,760
we follow

1280
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,160
whether to go with everyone

1281
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,240
Or follow Baishatun

1282
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,000
You all know that I built your soil

1283
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,800
If you got this

1284
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,760
You see, from Miaoli to Beigang

1285
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,200
about three days

1286
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,200
then take a day off

1287
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,200
Because Mazu is going back to her mother's house

1288
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,900
Let her reunite with her mother

1289
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,140
rest for a day

1290
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,400
then walk back

1291
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,940
It takes nine days to go back and forth from Miaoli

1292
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,560
If you start from Dajia, then eight days

1293
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,040
Just walk on two legs

1294
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,500
How many dangers are there in the middle

1295
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,800
especially during the Qing Dynasty

1296
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,200
every village

1297
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,500
you out of your

1298
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
your village your fate is in doubt

1299
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Because there's a bandit, there's this bandit

1300
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
What kind of aborigines made grass, all kinds

1301
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So it was not so easy for them to enter the countryside before.

1302
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Now it's because you're on the highway

1303
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
take the highway

1304
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Although all of Taiwan, we say that after Shawei Xiao’s mother

1305
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The whole highway is into the countryside

1306
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
But why doesn't Bai Sha Teng Da Jia have your name?

1307
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Because he still keeps walking to this day

1308
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
One nine days, one eight days back and forth

1309
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
so you can fully understand

1310
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
People at that time had no roads and no lights at night

1311
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You're still walking there

1312
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Just going to the countryside can let you

1313
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
wait a minute we'll talk

1314
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Let you experience the most grassroots folk life

1315
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
so why now

1316
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Every year until March everyone opens again

1317
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,760
Starting to revive the tradition that says go

1318
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:10,160
Well, the process of coming to Taiwan is in Tianhui’s sketchbook

1319
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,600
There are a few myths about

1320
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,400
It's all about Shiro

1321
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,260
This goes back to what we just talked about

1322
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:24,260
This is the statue of Mazu worshiped in a typical Taiwanese Mazu temple

1323
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:25,460
right? sit down

1324
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,400
He sat in that temple

1325
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,500
Why is his Mazu banned?

1326
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,860
He was named Mrs. Tianhui

1327
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,000
It's not drinking tea with nothing to do over there.

1328
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
He wants every opportunity

1329
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,860
Just like the view of this place in ancient times, every day is full of opportunities

1330
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,160
So he sat in the middle of that temple

1331
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,060
These are little idols

1332
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,800
If you go inside the temple and look at the big statue

1333
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,160
Is it the main hall or the Dingmiao?

1334
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,960
Of course it is taller.

1335
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,300
As soon as you enter the temple, you can see how big he is

1336
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,360
he is the one

1337
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,200
It's really a day-to-day job

1338
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,160
All believers enter through the gate of his temple

1339
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,360
was seen by him

1340
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,720
He takes care of all your problems

1341
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,920
This is usually smaller

1342
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,360
It's just a statue, what kind of mother

1343
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,960
What kind of Zwirner curse

1344
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,360
It was enshrined on the boat

1345
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:17,520
This is relatively small

1346
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,520
Or someone else's

1347
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,200
This is relatively small

1348
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,720
I just used it to illustrate

1349
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,520
The statue of Mazu in Taiwan looks like this

1350
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,400
And his eyes are hanging

1351
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,720
hang down you don't get too dirty

1352
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,640
believer

1353
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,240
believer

1354
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,560
He hangs down like this, you see

1355
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,520
that is

1356
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,760
He is used to process formulas

1357
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,440
There are two forms of propagation of Mazu belief

1358
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,160
The first is a spider web type

1359
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,880
For example, from Meizhou

1360
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,280
from the Song Dynasty

1361
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,880
you can spread everywhere

1362
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,840
Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Tianjin, Taiwan

1363
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,640
Another one is vertical

1364
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,240
This is radiation

1365
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,740
The other one is a vertical Xi Po shape

1366
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,840
For example, from the Meizhou Ancestral Temple

1367
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,640
Then it splits into Beigang Imperial Palace

1368
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,640
The Beigang Imperial Palace can also be divided into Dajia and Changhua

1369
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,600
Then Dajia and Zhengnangong can also split their spirits to Keelung

1370
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,960
So it forms such a system

1371
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,340
It's Xi Po and Kinio's

1372
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,340
Zupu like our people

1373
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,640
It's your Azu, Agong, Dad

1374
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,140
Then you can become a Pu family like you

1375
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,540
It is also a way of spreading

1376
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,700
precisely because of this

1377
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:33,940
That's why we have incense and incense

1378
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,040
Because the incense is viewed from above

1379
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,000
You go down

1380
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,740
Fenxiang is a general term, generally speaking, Fenling

1381
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:49,800
Because if you split your spirit, you can use the method of double body

1382
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,600
For example, carve another statue of Mazu

1383
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,200
this kind of separation

1384
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,640
You can also go because you have no money

1385
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,740
Carve another statue of Mazu

1386
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,400
so you take a small

1387
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,500
Small incense bag, you can donate about 100 yuan

1388
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,500
You can get a small incense bag

1389
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,500
You can take it with you, and then you go to San Francisco, USA

1390
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,500
Immigration to Brasilia

1391
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,500
That incense bag is also called split spirit

1392
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Therefore, splitting spirits can use the method of avatars

1393
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,500
Divide the statue, you can use the way of distributing incense

1394
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Bring an incense bag, it's called split spirit

1395
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Then you wait until you settle down locally

1396
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,500
You have the ability, you slowly built a temple

1397
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
So you have to go back and make incense

1398
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
want to go back for incense

1399
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,500
So it's up to you to share the fragrance

1400
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,000
divide one by one

1401
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Like the grandparents, the fathers

1402
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
to a son

1403
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,500
But up you go back to the owner

1404
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,500
go back and offer incense

1405
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Go back and worship your grandpa and grandpa

1406
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,500
That's it

1407
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,500
The universality of the gods of Chinese folk beliefs

1408
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,500
He actually responds to people

1409
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,500
The drama of the human world

1410
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
So in response to what we just said

1411
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
why gods have that

1412
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,760
What are you scolding, work, do

1413
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,500
This is why he wants the owner

1414
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,440
Then why did Da Jia give male workers a gift?

1415
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,000
He said that when he went back to Beigang Imperial Palace, it was the owner, Jingxiang

1416
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,640
Okay, so here are a few pictures I took early on.

1417
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,120
In 1986, Dajia

1418
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,160
you see what is written here

1419
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,800
What about this male worker who is now in Dajia?

1420
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,800
don't like me posting this photo

1421
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,600
He said that we have long since stopped going to Beigang to enter the countryside

1422
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,600
We are now going to Newport to look in the mirror

1423
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,960
Why are you still posting this old photo?

1424
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,400
But history can't be erased

1425
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,100
Look here, it's written as a gift to the male worker

1426
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:49,560
Our Lady goes to Beigang, enters the countryside and enters the valley

1427
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,960
This is the headshot

1428
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,760
It's Pioneer

1429
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,760
There is still a series of teams going to the countryside

1430
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,760
Then why do you say you want to cut it?

1431
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,040
is the fire owner

1432
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,080
These nouns are all said by Zheng Nangong himself.

1433
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:05,120
not what i said

1434
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,920
because of an anthropological survey

1435
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,220
We just use that local term

1436
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,120
That is to say, the locals, the reporters

1437
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,540
his vocabulary

1438
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:16,380
It's not what we put in academic vocabulary

1439
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:19,460
They said they were going to hang up

1440
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,480
then go to the owner

1441
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,020
The owner is of course bye

1442
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,600
In that era before 1987

1443
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,640
1986 was his penultimate time

1444
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:30,720
He stopped going to Beigang in 1988

1445
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,800
he cut the fire

1446
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,560
I can only speak with my mouth

1447
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,880
i didn't put a photo

1448
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,900
that is

1449
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,200
Where is the incense burner in Zheng Nangong?

1450
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,760
After being brought to Beigang, the two incense burners were put together

1451
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,080
Then the monk will start from

1452
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,380
Use that for the incense burner in Beigang

1453
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:49,400
soup sticks

1454
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,220
Just shake three scoops to this

1455
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,000
Everyone's Incense Burner

1456
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,060
every spoonful

1457
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,080
What Guotai Minan

1458
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,120
good weather

1459
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Wishing in six places, bringing the five shares of harvest like this

1460
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Then everyone quickly put away his incense burner

1461
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
put it in a packing list he brought

1462
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It's just a wooden seat and a box to put it away.

1463
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
That's his whole pilgrimage

1464
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
The core value of the group spent tens of millions of yuan

1465
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I'm going to bring this incense back

1466
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Bring back the spiritual power of incense ash and take everyone

1467
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
After taking it back

1468
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Take this incense ash from Northport

1469
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
use a smaller spoon

1470
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Put them one by one into the whole Dajia

1471
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
There are about a dozen incense burners in Zhannan Palace

1472
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
This is called cutting fire

1473
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Then Ye Zu is Ye's

1474
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The meaning of the Mazu of Beigang Chaotian Palace

1475
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
that this is along the way

1476
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
these are old photos

1477
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Talk about Nenjiu coffee along the way

1478
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
this nenjiu coffee

1479
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Nen Jiuka is the believers along the way

1480
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,700
Just arrived in Changhua

1481
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,140
Then they kneel down along the way

1482
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,740
wait for that big teacher

1483
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:10,340
just pass on them

1484
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:12,380
Believers say that they can pray for peace

1485
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:15,820
like that

1486
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,660
like x-ray

1487
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,380
like that now what do we say

1488
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,500
like tomography

1489
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Then this clairvoyance

1490
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,340
then he

1491
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,840
all mirror images

1492
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,780
Consisting of small groups one by one

1493
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:43,080
what about each group

1494
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,180
all have their own characteristics

1495
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,380
like this show flag team is

1496
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:49,320
All made up of vowed women

1497
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:50,820
Plus he has that T-babe

1498
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:52,460
It's the cycling team.

1499
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,060
motorcycle team

1500
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:55,700
that ox cart

1501
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:59,500
lorry truck oil cable car

1502
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,740
There are various teams

1503
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:05,500
So walk for several kilometers like this

1504
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,280
The women who made the vow

1505
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,920
because you make a wish if you say

1506
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,840
Son returns from military service

1507
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,540
son admitted to university

1508
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,460
Or my mother-in-law recovered from illness

1509
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,120
Or the harvest of my fields

1510
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,300
any house is fine

1511
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,500
Then say that I pay my respects to my hometown

1512
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,000
Then you will come to Jingxiang

1513
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:29,840
Then this is across the Hiero Bridge

1514
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,340
Then every local

1515
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,000
the local temple will come to welcome

1516
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,660
it's a bit of a parody of that

1517
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,660
we handed to china times

1518
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,160
It's the time when the emperor goes on tour in micro-clothes

1519
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:43,300
then everywhere

1520
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,500
The magistrate will come to welcome

1521
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,000
well, that's exactly

1522
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,500
Folk belief is a copy

1523
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:54,300
This one from our Huang Dynasty period

1524
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,000
A replica of the bureaucracy

1525
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,660
Then this is Beigang

1526
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Beigang

1527
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I didn't bring another photo

1528
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
This is the former Beigang and the other

1529
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
The little train in Tangchang, Taiwan

1530
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
one fifth

1531
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
The five-point car is a small train specially used to transport

1532
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
The dry slag sugar from Tangchang

1533
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Then to Beigang

1534
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The locals they organized this Dajia

1535
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Head Township

1536
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Teams from Two Townships and Three Townships

1537
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
He's here to sponsor this whole race team

1538
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
all these shows

1539
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
The performances are sponsored by Sanxiang of Touxiang

1540
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
So these three relative

1541
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
they have some rights

1542
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
For example, wait until it is equal to Grandma Zu

1543
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well

1544
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
After cutting the fire, when you want to go back to Dajia?

1545
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
they can plug in

1546
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
like when you celebrate new year

1547
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Rushing to Xingtiangong Plug Township means the same thing

1548
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That's also a worthwhile study

1549
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
What is Plug Township?

1550
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Why Plug Township

1551
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Why Gardens Need Plug Boxes

1552
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
what did the plug box get

1553
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
good

1554
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Then in 1988, if you see them, they won’t go

1555
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Beigang is going to Xingang Public Office to open Taiwan Mazu

1556
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
good

1557
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
So we start from that temple ranking dispute

1558
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
We can analyze the community identity of that civil society

1559
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and historical memory

1560
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Let's wait and see if we have time to talk about the details

1561
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
These are the two temples, Xingang Beigang

1562
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
They are arguing about why Beigang chose this new port in the end

1563
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
good

1564
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
good

1565
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
That's what I'm reporting to you

1566
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Origin and development

1567
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Then there is his relationship with modern society

1568
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Mazu belief is one of our folk beliefs in Taiwan

1569
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,000
What is very special is that he followed the changes in Taiwanese society.

1570
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And it fits well

1571
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,600
close he is not a dead faith

1572
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,260
He is not locked in a temple

1573
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:07,760
A Faith Known Only to Believers

1574
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,860
He walked with the pulse of the entire Taiwanese society

1575
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:16,460
So let's just look at these five aspects

1576
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,360
just in politics

1577
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,960
We have been since 1987

1578
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,360
Why did he still go to Beigang in 1987?

1579
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,760
I won't go there in 1988

1580
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,960
Because of his October 1987

1581
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,360
1987 happened to be

1582
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,920
Do you remember Mazu

1583
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,560
died in 987

1584
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,360
so

1585
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,360
Died in AD 987

1586
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:45,460
1987 coincided with the 1000th anniversary of the birth of other languages

1587
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,260
What about the Meizhou Ancestral Temple?

1588
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,560
They just came to open up at the time of Deng Xiaoping

1589
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,860
So come back to Taiwan

1590
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:57,560
Ancestral Temple in Meizhou is like Mazu temples all over the world

1591
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,260
just say love

1592
01:13:59,260 --> 01:13:59,960
welcome

1593
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,520
Come back to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the birth of Mazu

1594
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:10,840
Then most of the Mazu temples in Taiwan will not be moved after receiving the love iron

1595
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,040
hide it

1596
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:13,560
only Dajia

1597
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:14,840
because he was

1598
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,160
want to string together

1599
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:18,180
Dajia

1600
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:22,780
Local people We know that all temples in Taiwan have places

1601
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,620
Favorable people are supporting

1602
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:29,700
They are regardless of politics, economy and religion

1603
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:30,980
are tied together

1604
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,780
So what about the big guys?

1605
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,840
They want to string together they use this

1606
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,880
go

1607
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,420
Meizhou Township

1608
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:43,520
So with this invitation letter, they held a meeting in the temple.

1609
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,340
Decided to say yes we're going to take the risk

1610
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,920
Take the risk, but you can't just go there at that time

1611
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:52,220
So they flew to Japan first

1612
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:53,260
Then

1613
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,100
Then to Shanghai From Japan to Shanghai and then to Shanghai

1614
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:58,120
Meizhou

1615
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:58,840
good

1616
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,800
Because at that time the two sides of the strait had not yet opened

1617
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,800
So after going to Meizhou in this way

1618
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,200
Really spent the night there back to Liang's house

1619
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,000
Everyone is terrified, those directors and supervisors of Dajiazhen Nangong

1620
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,600
17 people

1621
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,200
I was terrified and wondered if I would be left there by the CCP

1622
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,000
What if I can't come back to Taiwan in the future?

1623
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
So before going back to Taiwan

1624
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,600
They hurriedly told the Legislative Yuan that Liu Songfan was still at that time

1625
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,000
when the legislator

1626
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,200
Liu Songfan is from Dajia

1627
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,100
His younger brother is Liu Songlin

1628
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,200
It's a person from Mazu Temple

1629
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,900
So deploy it first

1630
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,400
Taiwan's airport can't come and arrest us

1631
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,400
Even he is afraid that the CCP will keep him

1632
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:47,400
But when he returned to Taiwan, he was also afraid that the Taiwan government would arrest him

1633
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,100
Because you are fat like this, aren't you?

1634
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:52,100
So fix everything here first

1635
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,500
I'll be back when I'm done

1636
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,900
Anyway, what happened back then

1637
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,500
You still have newspapers when you go back

1638
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,700
no drama

1639
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:00,000
so

1640
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,800
That is, October 1987 at that time

1641
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,440
Dajia sneaked away to Meizhou to enter the countryside for the first time

1642
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,680
You'll be fine when you come back

1643
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,600
Then he started promoting

1644
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,320
That is to say, I am now the leader of the Mazu Temple in Taiwan

1645
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,080
Why?

1646
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:18,120
If I win back the statue of Meizhou

1647
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,960
I know the latest

1648
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,560
The latest Meizhou idol in Beigang is from 200 years ago

1649
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,840
Now this is the latest Meizhou idol

1650
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,920
most fierce

1651
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,800
just won back

1652
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:29,480
right

1653
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:30,680
The fiercest

1654
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,440
so he said my

1655
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,000
My Mazu is the most respectful

1656
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:34,800
all Taiwan

1657
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,320
Welcome all Mazu temples in Taiwan to come to my side

1658
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,160
into the countryside

1659
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,840
In Beigang, you just scold Dajia and say you are Sudianwang

1660
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,120
Sudianwang

1661
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,000
you last year

1662
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,880
not last year

1663
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,560
In March of this year, you still came to my side to enter the countryside

1664
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:54,200
Also called my owner into the countryside

1665
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,440
You went to Meizhou in October and came back

1666
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,800
You are Sudianwang

1667
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,720
I'm Meizhou

1668
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,240
you are directly

1669
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,160
Dajia wants to climb from granddaughter to daughter

1670
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,720
I didn’t say that because we didn’t just talk about Meizhou

1671
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,040
Then Beigang and then Dajia?

1672
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:14,160
Now Dajia is going up one level

1673
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,600
He wants to climb from the status of granddaughter to the status of daughter

1674
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,280
It's like this, of course Beigang won't let it go.

1675
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,840
Then Dajia wants to make a comeback now

1676
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,360
He must. Later, Beigang told you not to come.

1677
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,560
Su Dian Wang Dajia told me that I will not go

1678
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,520
i'm your sister now i'm not yours

1679
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:37,200
I'm not your daughter. He's not going.

1680
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,520
Okay, after two people tear their faces apart

1681
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,200
That Xingang came out to be a Japanese room boss

1682
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,440
There is only one bridge between Xingang and Beigang

1683
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,840
Xingang said then you don't have to move

1684
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,040
Anyway, when the troops of the brigade are brought down from Dajia

1685
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,160
Just tilt it this way at the last point

1686
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,480
It went to Xingang

1687
01:17:55,480 --> 01:18:00,200
So 1988 was the second year and the Newport was ready

1688
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,560
Open all elementary schools and clean them

1689
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:03,840
all toilets

1690
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,380
That's very busy

1691
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,920
in a few days you will

1692
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,960
You see tens of thousands of people

1693
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,040
In 1988, there were about 60,000 pilgrims

1694
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,840
You have to prepare food and drink for 60,000 people

1695
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,380
It's not easy

1696
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,660
Xingang Usual

1697
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,720
have you ever done such a thing

1698
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:22,020
Anyway, let's go like this

1699
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,040
ok

1700
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,320
So since that year

1701
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,900
Every year since 1987, everyone sees

1702
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:30,720
Didn't he get locked up for this?

1703
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,540
So he goes back every year once a week for

1704
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,600
The spiritual power of the Mazu who can maintain him

1705
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,440
That's the one that hit us in Taiwan

1706
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,480
that

1707
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,260
cross-strait policy

1708
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:49,400
Then I want you to know about the political part behind this, because although the Kuomintang, the Democratic Progressive Party, and the Kuomintang

1709
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,680
But cross-strait policy

1710
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,520
It was indeed initially opened by religious exchanges

1711
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,320
Only then did the small three links

1712
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,340
Daisan Street

1713
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,600
and other exchanges

1714
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,260
good economical

1715
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:05,260
I use Xingang cultural and creative industry as an example

1716
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:08,960
we know in 1994

1717
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,800
That is, the document will propose the overall construction of the community

1718
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,960
In the future, every village in Taiwan

1719
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:22,260
We must develop our own industry by ourselves

1720
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,660
Many industries are not well developed

1721
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,560
later they trial and error

1722
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,120
Many later discovered that religion

1723
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:34,220
Especially with the temple as the center of a community

1724
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:40,360
Can gain the trust of most villagers

1725
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,900
because you see

1726
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:46,000
In a village, if I say I want to build a cemetery furnace

1727
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,780
simply put

1728
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,840
Build a burial furnace

1729
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,140
Can't cover it for several years

1730
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,440
Same goes for building a road why

1731
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,120
Yes, no benefit

1732
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Different parties cannot cover

1733
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
But in the end, let's go to the front of the Mazu Temple, baby

1734
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
see if you want to cover

1735
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So in other words religion plays a role

1736
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
interracial

1737
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
A relatively high status of the quali group

1738
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,000
So I found some places later

1739
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
The community uses the temple as a

1740
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
The center of overall creation of community development

1741
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
can do something

1742
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Environmental friendly

1743
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Like the nuclear market in Gongliao

1744
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
We also know that repeatedly

1745
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Covered and stopped and covered

1746
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Then there is a temple in Gongliao

1747
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Jiaorenhegong Mazu Temple

1748
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
His Mazu

1749
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
later known as the anti-nuclear mother

1750
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Because every time they go anti-nuclear

1751
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
that is

1752
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
As I just said, in your community

1753
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Half of the people are in favor of Gai and Song

1754
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
because you'll get some benefits

1755
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Half of the people opposed to capping the market

1756
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,000
The two factions are at loggerheads

1757
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Finally, the man and the public Mazu Temple

1758
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
just carry it out for a parade

1759
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
That is to say, Mazu is the mother of the sea

1760
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It's our country goddess

1761
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
We want to love our family and our country

1762
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
love our community

1763
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
So it is to carry Mazu out for a parade

1764
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Her name is Fanhe

1765
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Well, another example would be

1766
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
DuPont in Lukang

1767
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
We know that DuPont is an American

1768
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
brand factory

1769
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
He chose Lukang to build

1770
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
But at that time in Lukang

1771
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Everyone in Lukang is against it

1772
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Because of their what-that-waste

1773
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
I'm not ready today so I can't tell you the details

1774
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
will pollute the local

1775
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So they also carried out the Tianhou Palace in Lukang

1776
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
That is, there are two Tianhou Temples in Lukang

1777
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
the old one

1778
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I also carried that mother out

1779
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
then say

1780
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,600
To protect our country

1781
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,600
So Mazu has become synonymous with native land

1782
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,600
rural pronoun

1783
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,600
It is Mazu who protects us

1784
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,900
She is our Mother Earth

1785
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,700
He is our Ocean Mother Goddess

1786
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,600
It's like becoming a spokesman for the country

1787
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,700
Can represent the community as a speaking symbol

1788
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:28,900
words of education

1789
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,200
so many years now

1790
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:38,400
You watched the TV or media reports

1791
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,500
Every time I come to the country

1792
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:43,900
You can see the studios of literature and history around the world

1793
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,100
And Yan Xiying, a teacher in the countryside

1794
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,200
Zhong Primary School Teacher

1795
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,900
They will all choose to be a person who understands the local culture

1796
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,500
an opportunity to participate in the country

1797
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:00,000
Then along the way, I got to know some grassroots people in the rural areas of Taiwan.

1798
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,880
items of some cultures that have disappeared

1799
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,440
In addition to talking about the bottom

1800
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:10,000
There are also 10 or 20 master and doctoral dissertations

1801
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Just now we met an Englishman in the audience

1802
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,600
where is the female graduate student who came

1803
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,200
Emily

1804
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,680
Emily,where are you?

1805
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,640
He said

1806
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:29,160
He said he was here to write Mazu's master's thesis

1807
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:33,920
There are three doctoral dissertations that came to Zhongyuan to ask me for help

1808
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,440
are all

1809
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,760
you just know

1810
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:42,280
The Mazu culture in Taiwan has already become an issue in international academic circles

1811
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,280
Because you can use it to communicate with other cultures

1812
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,800
compare with

1813
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,160
Like the Islamic pilgrimage

1814
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,880
catholic pilgrimage

1815
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,360
Pilgrimage around the world can be used for comparison

1816
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,120
it's educational

1817
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,960
In addition, in terms of culture, we are cultivating

1818
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,400
Humanities and Intangible Cultural Heritage

1819
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:07,440
especially now in 2009

1820
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,560
Year 2009

1821
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:17,240
Originally, Taiwan wanted to bring Mazu belief to UNESCO

1822
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:21,120
Unesco to apply for world-class

1823
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,920
Intangible Cultural Heritage

1824
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:28,320
But this news was known by the mainland

1825
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,720
they did it

1826
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,520
Of course they do it faster

1827
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:36,320
They got him up in a month or so

1828
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,480
it exploded

1829
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:38,560
explosion explosion

1830
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:42,560
There are several people who educate people from the place of Kamata

1831
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,480
meat industry

1832
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,160
The meat industry wrote those required documents

1833
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,040
Then those people hurried to live in Beijing

1834
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:52,080
Stay in a hotel

1835
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:57,920
How to communicate with that central-level official

1836
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,920
Must be on within a few days

1837
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,240
The application documents are all written

1838
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:06,040
And because the mainland came to call

1839
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,120
Look at the basic information about Taiwan

1840
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,600
Malaysia Singapore Hong Kong

1841
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,920
Information on Mazu Temples in various places in Macau

1842
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,760
He just took it

1843
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,520
Wow, he represents the Mazu temples all over the world

1844
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,560
Year 2009

1845
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,600
successfully applied for that world-class human

1846
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:24,360
Intangible Cultural Heritage

1847
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,040
So now Mazu belief is in mainland China

1848
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:30,720
In addition to saying that it is to welcome Taiwan compatriots back

1849
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,360
another one

1850
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,560
Another nice one

1851
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,600
The impressive title

1852
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,800
intangible cultural heritage

1853
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,680
you just hold this

1854
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,680
this hall of fame

1855
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,040
this name

1856
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,400
What reconstruction are you applying for?

1857
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,560
Reconstruction, renovation, addition

1858
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,520
usually right

1859
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,120
The local view is fine

1860
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,920
So Taiwan is also

1861
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,680
back again

1862
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,760
From 2009 to the present also rewind

1863
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,000
Many Mazu Temples in Taiwan

1864
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,520
I saw that I don't want to be just a tree religion

1865
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,000
I can also tree culture customs

1866
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,200
So now many Mazu temples in Taiwan have also added this item

1867
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:14,400
It is non-household cultural heritage to apply

1868
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,720
So there is the 2010 we just talked about

1869
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,040
Beigang Baishatun and Dajia

1870
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,720
Just registered with the Ministry of Culture as Taiwan's national

1871
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,160
Non-household cultural heritage

1872
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:30,440
Then last year and now the new year is only March

1873
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,560
Last year last year Newport Toyota Palace also applied

1874
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,200
but not yet

1875
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:42,440
So it is conceivable that many temples have to apply

1876
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,640
This is Xingang 2010

1877
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:48,560
I said this Haiji

1878
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,440
Because Mazu died on September 9th?

1879
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,880
After we treat Mazu as a god in Taiwan

1880
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,640
We don't remember his Haiji

1881
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,960
Because you know when you hear Haiji

1882
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,080
didn't catch you

1883
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,740
The bad memory says he fell into the sea and died

1884
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:03,440
right

1885
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,440
Otherwise, why Haiji?

1886
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,180
If he becomes an immortal, he will go to heaven and you will pay back

1887
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:09,580
Haiji

1888
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:10,980
that is not

1889
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:12,040
but

1890
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:12,880
this is taiwan

1891
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,840
Because we were in the Qing Dynasty

1892
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,180
Accepted Mazu is already a god

1893
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:21,780
But in Fujian, it is especially a good port

1894
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:23,280
The place where Mazu was born

1895
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,520
Didn't I just say that mainland scholars have been arguing all the time?

1896
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,820
One of them is that Xianlianggang is the place where Mazu was born.

1897
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,320
people of this faction

1898
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:35,020
It is because Xianlianggang still has the temporary ancestral hall of Mazu after all.

1899
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,820
had his first temple

1900
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:39,920
There's a lot of him in those uniforms

1901
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,520
those are

1902
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,920
that well

1903
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,420
Many monuments are still there

1904
01:27:44,420 --> 01:27:45,920
so

1905
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,900
Then they will hold this Haiji

1906
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,100
September 9

1907
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,800
So when you come here to do your research

1908
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,700
You can feel that Mazu is a person

1909
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:57,940
one person

1910
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,480
he

1911
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,160
A moral person, a very wise person looks like this

1912
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,460
you just feel that he is alone

1913
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:10,160
Unlike the Mazu we accept in Taiwan

1914
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,100
It's a god, it's already a god

1915
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,800
But Xingang Toyota's Taiwan

1916
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,200
In other words, if the mainland is going to hold a big event

1917
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,800
There must be Taiwanese believers to sponsor

1918
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,040
This is for sure

1919
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,940
Napu Tianshi Wenfeng Gonggang

1920
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,700
We are not talking about the Song Dynasty Mazu

1921
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,540
Are you enshrined here?

1922
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:35,500
You see, it is also a donation from Taiwan compatriots

1923
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,600
Let the whole Wenfenggong be rebuilt again

1924
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,140
Otherwise, his enclosure

1925
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:43,140
The wooden palace that is already a three-story walled building

1926
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:45,440
no one dares to climb up

1927
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:49,100
But now you see rebuilt like this

1928
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:54,700
That's why I put a piece of Hainan Island because

1929
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,860
Hainan Island because its ass is remote

1930
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:59,960
so their thean hou palace

1931
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,820
There is also the word Minyue here

1932
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:05,420
That is to say, there are some differences from Taiwan.

1933
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:08,520
For example, its Minyue does not have a vent

1934
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,500
Unlike Taiwan's Minyue, who will vent

1935
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,020
That can be compared with Thean Hou Palace

1936
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,020
In addition, their folk beliefs

1937
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:19,020
Although it is said that Mazu applied for it in 2009

1938
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,220
flying material cultural heritage

1939
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:25,020
But in such a remote place as Hainan Island

1940
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:27,360
What to manage? Intangible cultural heritage

1941
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,880
The builder in my place is going to come in and build a building

1942
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,480
How many billions can you earn if you get the building?

1943
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,560
Why do I still have Mazu Temple?

1944
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,680
guess guess

1945
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,560
We are probably the only one who can see the Thean Hou Temple

1946
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,360
Everything else is guesswork.

1947
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:48,240
This is also the size of the ancient mainland

1948
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,840
The whole face of its Mazu belief

1949
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,440
is different very different

1950
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,280
In Meizhou Island, because of the support of Taiwanese believers

1951
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,560
so it recovers well

1952
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,040
but in other regions

1953
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
different situations

1954
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:08,000
This is about creativity

1955
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It is the current cultural and creative industry

1956
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
That is to say, the combination of Mazu Temple

1957
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Cultural and creative industries are used to develop his economy

1958
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Then Xingang Deputy Senior Worker's

1959
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
There is a characteristic of Mazu Temple that says their Tiger Lord

1960
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
is very famous

1961
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
So they also did this

1962
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
In addition, this is environmentally friendly

1963
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Xingang people call the foundation to do environmental protection

1964
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
planting natural rice

1965
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Then green their local Xingang Hong

1966
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
cultural and creative industries

1967
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
These are made of incense

1968
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
incense made

1969
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
This is the new shape

1970
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
also made with incense

1971
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
It is to become a new product in their local area

1972
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
How many people want to buy incense now

1973
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,960
If you go for two hundred yuan, no one will buy it.

1974
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,960
Because many people don't say goodbye now

1975
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,960
But those self-confessed masters

1976
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,960
And those SMEs?

1977
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,960
Did you say you want him to close the door?

1978
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,960
Mostly closed, yes

1979
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,960
or go to the mainland

1980
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,960
Or buy that Vietnamese case

1981
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,960
Then come to Taiwan for processing

1982
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:19,960
this is the cheapest

1983
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:23,960
But after all, these traditions in Taiwan

1984
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,960
traditional craftsmen

1985
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:27,960
some things he doesn't want to give up

1986
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:29,960
improve improve

1987
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,960
Then the galaxy is reshaped and then spiced

1988
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,960
What about the volunteer process and method?

1989
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:36,960
improve and then

1990
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,960
can create a new market

1991
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,960
This corresponding park

1992
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,960
this place is available

1993
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,960
Google it yourself

1994
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:48,960
can go to play

1995
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,960
it becomes a

1996
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,960
one of those playgrounds

1997
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:55,960
DIY also has

1998
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:57,960
That restaurant also has hotels and B&Bs

1999
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:58,960
have everything

2000
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,960
This is a

2001
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,840
A self-contained industry after transformation

2002
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,440
then these what

2003
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:12,160
ceramics

2004
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,040
Because inside our traditional temple

2005
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,440
The process required

2006
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,240
Now there is also this new development

2007
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,840
This is flat creation industry

2008
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,160
come out

2009
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:47,560
you come again

2010
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,440
didn't you just say

2011
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,560
look far away

2012
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:57,960
There is a new statue of Mazu

2013
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,160
Here's the Meadows Citizen in Northport

2014
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Follow the two of Nei Zun Meizhou Island to look at each other

2015
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Because this statue was sent by Meizhou Island

2016
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Then Meizhou Island Nei Zun was sent by Beigang

2017
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,000
They are relatives of Dijie

2018
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Again

2019
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Then this new model of Mazu

2020
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It is now used by China

2021
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:34,000
And focus on promoting a version of Mazu

2022
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
everywhere

2023
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Look at that shape

2024
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Now they don't enshrine

2025
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Our traditional sitting Mazu

2026
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Black

2027
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
So what they worship is this

2028
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
This is Mazu in Macau

2029
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Macau returned to China in 1999

2030
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Mainland?

2031
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
So the mainland will send them

2032
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,400
And this is one time I went to Australia for a meeting

2033
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,400
The local friend told me

2034
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,800
Over there I used to have a statue of a goddess in Chinese

2035
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,900
you go and see

2036
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:14,700
He said he couldn't figure out what kind of idol that was.

2037
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:15,900
let's go see

2038
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,200
really boss

2039
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,800
OK, it's concluded because time

2040
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,400
The Study of Folk Beliefs

2041
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,700
what we're saying is

2042
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:31,600
he is not a dead faith

2043
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,000
Nor is it a non-us related

2044
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,100
an irrelevant belief

2045
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,500
he can be

2046
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,900
he can be society's reaction

2047
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:47,900
It is a response to social and cultural changes

2048
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:50,600
What about research on Mazu belief?

2049
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:53,900
It can be said to be a benchmark for the study of folk beliefs

2050
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,600
because of the beliefs of other gods

2051
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:57,600
hasn't happened yet

2052
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,000
Mazu beliefs all happened first

2053
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,400
After the Matsu belief first carried out this cross-strait exchange

2054
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,400
All subsequent gods have gone to mainland owners

2055
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,200
Look at the Emperor Baosheng

2056
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:13,000
What Guangze Zunwang Sansan King

2057
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,000
And the emperor of Xuanyuanjiao

2058
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,700
Emperor Xuanyuan and that Emperor Guan Sheng

2059
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,100
and all the gods

2060
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:25,900
Now the plane on the two sides of the strait

2061
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:28,700
If you see the one holding that god

2062
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:32,500
Don't be weird, and don't look at people, it's impolite, right?

2063
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:35,400
You knew he was going to the countryside. That's right.

2064
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:40,300
Then the airlines first forbade them to take country slaves with them

2065
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:44,600
Because that violates the aviation safety law

2066
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,500
But not now, so many believers want

2067
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,900
So it's just that they have another way

2068
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:53,500
There is an alternative to that

2069
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,000
There is still time to pass

2070
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,400
If you hide something inside the idol

2071
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,000
Because isn’t God wearing many layers of clothes?

2072
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,100
What to put in it, when the Chinese customs refuse to give it

2073
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:08,700
Not even now, as long as you are a believer in Taiwan

2074
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:12,500
Then you walk with that idol in your arms

2075
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,200
Go through the customs all the way and go inside.

2076
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,800
Customs officers in the mainland did not dare to stop

2077
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,700
yes he wants to buy a place

2078
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:27,100
Because when you get on the plane, the gods also make a position

2079
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:31,200
also buy a place

2080
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,600
so internet safety belt

2081
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:41,300
yes or you will fall

2082
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:44,800
So the other gods haven't seen it yet

2083
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,300
You have already seen wave after wave on Mazu belief

2084
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,900
It is because Mazu belief is so prosperous in Taiwan

2085
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:54,000
He is close to our life again

2086
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:58,100
All aspects of your life will drive him

2087
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,400
He's also driven by you so he responds

2088
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Therefore, the study of Matsu belief is almost a benchmark for tomorrow's belief study

2089
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
The other is that our faith study is to put it back

2090
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Looking at the context of this social life

2091
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
OK, I'll just report here

2092
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Thank you very much Dr. Zhuang for the wonderful

2093
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
In just one hour, he

2094
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Tell us about the origin and development of this Matsu belief

2095
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Finally, some future

2096
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:48,000
That is to say, in fact, I sound like Western religious culture

2097
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
full of different

2098
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Our Matsu is almost integrated into our current life

2099
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:59,000
ok we can open now
