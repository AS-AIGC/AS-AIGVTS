1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,980
here.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,260
learn how to play yatown

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:29,940
bien hungry

4
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,280
Through rich

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,980
ring

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,060
applause

7
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,260
Thank you.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,720
Vice President Peng Xuming was supposed to host today

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,120
But because he just took office

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,420
Then he has traveled with people before

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,420
It was already ordered

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,980
so he can't come tonight

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,380
I want to help him host

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,800
then today's

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,560
This topic is of great interest

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,620
Issues that have attracted great attention in the past ten or twenty years

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,780
it's climate change

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,340
I want to talk about climate change twenty years ago

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,460
When environmental changes talk about these things

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,080
At that time, these seemed relatively foreign to at least some people.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,840
But now it has become very urgent

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,260
The first three weeks of our Academia Sinica

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,380
In this place in Thailand, the Pacific Institute of Science and Technology is organized

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,260
PNC

25
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,960
In Bangkok, it happened to encounter this flood problem

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,800
So this makes people feel that this issue is very urgent

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,700
So we are at Academia Sinica these days

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,160
In addition to the feast of knowledge tonight

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,380
We have an environmental history at the Renwen Pavilion

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,960
Conference on World Environmental History

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,900
It's also worth going

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,740
Today we invited the speaker is this

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,140
Inter-director of the Special Review Researcher of the Environmental Change Center of the Academia Sinica

34
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,140
Professor Liu Shaocheng

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,200
Professor Liu is a member of the School of Physics at Cheng Kung University

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Go to PizBall University in the United States to get a Ph.D. in physics

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Since then he has stayed in the United States to work

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
U.S. Oceanographic Service

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Research Director of Daji Physics Laboratory

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
also served at the Georgia Institute of Technology

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Chair Professor of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
department head

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He returned to the China Security Research Institute 12 years ago

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That horse was first on Earth

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then came the creation of the Environmental Center

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
if memory serves me right

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There seem to be more than 1000

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Contributors also get a certificate

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Director Liu also got a

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It can be seen that he has participated in the concern for a long time

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There are also research contributions in this area

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We have gained great international

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
recall and affirm

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,640
I am very happy to have the opportunity to invite him to give a speech today

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,000
And he's talking about the topics he's good at

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
climate change in taiwan

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,840
The subtitle is Shock Mitigation and Adaptation

59
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,240
We now applaud Professor Liu

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,440
applause applause

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
applause applause

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Vice President Wang

63
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Everyone advanced

64
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
Colleagues

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Ladies

66
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,800
hello gentlemen

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,640
global warming climate change

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,400
I believe everyone has heard it many times

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,640
I was actually a feast of knowledge in 2004

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,200
Also talked about a topic quite related to this topic

71
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,600
Actually today when I was preparing

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Today I

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,960
I said that I must be completely different from that film in 2004.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,440
ah

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,200
No

76
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,240
Of course, there will always be a few articles, and I counted them.

77
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,200
15% of the films are pretty close to last time

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,400
No

79
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,240
This time this year

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:27,160
I'll show you guys look at our first one this one this one is very different

81
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,600
In fact, what do I say about that, that, and this movie?

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,360
Tell me, introduce me, introduce us to you

83
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
this is gone

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,560
Whoops

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,600
ah

86
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm afraid I can make a brighter one, and this one is basically invisible.

87
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,640
I want to go to the back. This is basically the introduction.

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,400
This is, of course, the history that Vice President Wang is most familiar with.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
OK Human Evolution History

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,800
The first green one is Lucy

91
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,000
You see Lucy is very interesting

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,080
I believe everyone has heard

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,920
Africa's first dug

94
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,200
Lucy who looks like a human

95
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,480
We suppose are all its descendants

96
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,720
Everyone also noticed that the original people in Beijing were

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,360
This is about 3 million years

98
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Peking Man was less than 1 million years old

99
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,800
800,000 years

100
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,120
Then Homo sapiens was almost 200,000 years ago

101
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,040
And then until Homo sapiens came out

102
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,880
not exodus

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,120
After leaving Africa

104
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,200
Then the first most important historical

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,920
what happened was

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Ancient civilization

107
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,280
Everyone probably knows about ancient civilizations that there are four ancient civilizations

108
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,800
Since Father Wang is here, I won’t ask you what the four are.

109
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,360
Originally, I thought it was because Father Wang knew too well

110
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,920
So I won't bring up this question any more

111
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,920
Ancient civilization

112
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,400
Of course including China iQi

113
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
basically in almost

114
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,080
That is to say, from four thousand years to almost eight thousand years

115
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,240
developed

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
From a climate point of view

117
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,920
human evolution

118
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,520
Now here I am a

119
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,800
This is time and this is temperature

120
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,280
zero degrees here

121
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,840
OK

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,080
Of course, this so-called zero degree is only used to represent

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,920
is the current temperature before the industrial revolution

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,320
because zero is here

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,480
this is two degrees this is minus two degrees

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,440
OK

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
Of course the dinosaurs were hot

128
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,320
this is it

129
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,280
But what we just saw

130
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,880
Ha, this ancient civilization is almost

131
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,760
ah

132
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,440
About five, six, five, or six thousand years ago

133
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,080
ha

134
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,040
it's here

135
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,800
OK

136
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
this paragraph

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,440
this paragraph now

138
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,760
Of course, it is called the best period of the new climate.

139
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,640
OK

140
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,000
ah

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,560
Then why is this the best period for a new climate?

142
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,000
it has its reasons

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,400
at that time

144
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
it's time again

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,800
OK

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
it's four thousand years

147
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,680
ten thousand years you see

148
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,160
four thousand to ten thousand years

149
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,600
you look at the northern hemisphere

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
all red and yellow

151
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,600
all on average

152
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,920
Middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere

153
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,400
almost two degrees

154
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,040
this ratio

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,880
more than two degrees higher than now

156
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,600
But in the low-dimensional sea

157
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,160
Ocean temperatures are relatively low

158
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,920
So what I just showed you is here

159
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,320
This is the best time for the new climate

160
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,280
The best period is of course when the northern hemisphere was very warm just now

161
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,480
Civilization develops when it's very warm

162
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,400
make it easy for everyone to think of

163
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,880
That is to say, the high temperature I showed you just now

164
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,920
That is to say, two degrees higher

165
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,720
compared with just now

166
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,640
You see, we humans have been talking about 3 million years since just now

167
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,080
Lucy has basically been here since she started

168
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
you see it's very cold

169
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,520
cold to sometimes more than two degrees

170
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,120
most of the time 80% of the time

171
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,000
We are in a much colder super than the current

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,640
almost once

173
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,960
develop there

174
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
evolve there

175
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,360
So from this point of view

176
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,960
We should be very suitable

177
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,320
cooler earth

178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,560
Than what two once looked like now

179
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,640
But once we get here, than now

180
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,360
hotter than we're used to

181
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,000
culture

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,640
civilization

183
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,400
culture develops

184
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,440
This is a very interesting phenomenon

185
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,760
I've actually always been interested in this

186
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,520
Here I also show you

187
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,000
we are now greenhouse gas

188
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,840
Scenarios for temperature increase by 2100

189
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,760
It's about 2 to 4 degrees

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
i draw it here

191
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,720
2 to 4 degrees

192
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,400
Everyone think about our

193
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
It's almost over 2 degrees here

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,560
In fact, many people say

195
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,720
since we are here

196
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,360
culture develops so fast

197
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,400
so good

198
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
obviously the climate you see

199
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,480
this too

200
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,280
recognized worldwide

201
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,440
This is not a word I invented

202
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,760
Here is another solid

203
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
best climate

204
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,040
warmer

205
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,880
OK

206
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,000
and at that time it was true

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,320
The Earth's

208
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,000
productivity

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,400
yes

210
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,840
it is this

211
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,480
just say that

212
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,120
earth creatures

213
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
The situation of growth

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
It is indeed very

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,160
special

216
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,040
how to say

217
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,480
very prosperous

218
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:41,920
OK

219
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,280
In comparison

220
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,480
then someone will say

221
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,200
since we want

222
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
two to four degrees hotter

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,400
that would have been this

224
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,040
Let's say four thousand years to almost ten thousand years ago

225
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,120
It's so hot and so good

226
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,240
Then why should we worry about the future

227
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,120
climate warming

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,500
The problem

229
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,700
it was brought up

230
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,500
And it's actually quite interesting that a

231
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
a very meaningful topic

232
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,300
But before we go on

233
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
I want to give you a little introduction

234
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,700
here of course we are here now

235
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,500
OK

236
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,300
Then here it is a logarithm

237
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
this this mark

238
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,700
10,000 years from here to here

239
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,700
So the ancient civilization we are talking about is here

240
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,500
That

241
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,100
And then this little iceberg is here

242
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,700
OK

243
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,900
The other four big glacial oddities are here

244
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,700
Often the previous ones are many, many, many

245
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,500
big and small glaciers

246
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:45,900
OK

247
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:47,900
ah

248
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,200
what does this picture mean

249
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
I'm here to tell you about

250
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,500
The flood control by heavy rain was almost 4,000 years ago

251
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,100
OK

252
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
That's an interesting one here

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,680
Today I participated in the one mentioned by Vice President Wang just now

254
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,520
Conference on Environmental History of East Asian History

255
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,920
Many people mentioned the situation when the heavy rain cured the water

256
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes, what I mentioned just now is about greenhouse gases

257
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,040
What if you assume different greenhouse gases

258
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,360
In the worst case scenario, the greenhouse increases by almost four degrees

259
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,520
In the best case, the temperature will increase by nearly 2 degrees.

260
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,440
So 2 degrees to 4 degrees is currently our forecast

261
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
Scenarios for model-predicted warming

262
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,920
Going back to the four ancient Wenmin countries we talked about just now

263
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,240
China Egypt Asia Minor

264
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,480
About 4,000 to 7,000 years ago

265
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
developed at that time

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,920
Of course we just saw this and that

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
almost all history

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Scholars are talking about this

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It is said that there was a good climate at that time

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but the problem is

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What exactly does a good climate environment mean?

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Most books will say

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's very warm in the middle of the northern hemisphere

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Here I want to tell you

275
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wait so everyone can see

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This answer is definitely not like this

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This is actually the wrong answer

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't agree with the warm climate in the middle of the northern hemisphere

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That is what we just mentioned

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This is 4,000 to 10,000 years ago

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
this warm climate

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It is caused by itself to make the climate environment particularly good

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
why

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because you speak purely for the warmth of the temperature

285
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,240
You can go to lower latitudes to find warmer conditions

286
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:18,000
And all the four ancient civilizations developed almost in the middle and high latitudes

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,640
Not to mention the Huaxia people, we chose the Yellow River as the mother river of our so-called civilization

288
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,140
If it is purely for warmth, it can choose the Yangtze River

289
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,940
The Yangtze River is more abundant

290
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,240
So it did not choose the Yangtze River

291
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,040
It means that warmth is definitely not the first consideration

292
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:48,440
Elsewhere we also think warmth isn't really a first consideration

293
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,940
The reason I mentioned just now is that Lucy

294
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:59,240
Lucy to people for 3 million years

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
evolutionary life of man

296
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,200
basically living on an earth that is one degree colder than it is now

297
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,920
Because we have long been accustomed to this cool climate

298
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,120
another one

299
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,000
another very important point

300
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,680
That is to say, let's look at the cool climate

301
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,000
what does it mean

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,080
The cool climate environment actually includes a wide range of

303
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,960
it actually i think

304
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,840
The most important point is to include natural disasters which are relatively rare

305
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,960
When natural disasters are less likely to occur

306
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Only then can it be called a cool climate environment

307
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,720
Everyone assumes to look a little more carefully

308
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,120
The geographic location of the four major civilizations and five ancient countries

309
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,040
you all noticed

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,200
No country is right next to the sea

311
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,240
And no country is right next to the earthquake zone

312
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,240
According to the earthquake zone, the closest one is probably China.

313
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,560
It's pretty close according to Japan

314
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,720
But wait a while and see that the low tide of raising young people is still far from the sea.

315
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:28,040
So the so-called earthquakes and tsunamis had no effect on these ancient civilizations

316
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,640
But I'm afraid it's also those ancient civilizations that are really influenced by ancient civilizations.

317
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,640
Those close to earthquakes and tsunamis may not have developed

318
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,320
I believe

319
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,000
The problem now is that the risk of natural disasters is relatively low

320
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,080
Floods and droughts I believe are our ancestors

321
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,160
and any of their people from ancient civilizations

322
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,520
What they worry about most should be the thing they worry about most

323
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,080
flood

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,280
with the drought

325
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,100
Actually until now

326
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,900
Chinese mainland

327
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,440
Speaking of which, of course we are in Taiwan.

328
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,540
We in Taiwan are all worried about floods

329
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,160
best every year

330
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,960
The most shocking is the flood

331
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,280
But in mainland China it is a drought

332
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,140
Economic losses from their drought yearly drought

333
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,220
it's a disaster for them

334
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
i remember the number

335
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,180
It is almost like this in more than 70% of their natural disasters every year

336
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,220
so

337
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,340
How to avoid floods and droughts is actually the most important issue

338
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,720
Let's take China as an example below

339
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,020
that

340
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,320
Yangshao culture is famous

341
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,860
he is about a.d.

342
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,420
three thousand five thousand years ago

343
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,660
Yang Shao Culture

344
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,460
Did you see

345
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,540
It's quite far away

346
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,060
I'm afraid the tsunami won't reach here

347
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,340
This is near the Yellow River

348
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,060
OK

349
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,380
Of course it was 3,000 to 5,000 years ago

350
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,340
more than a thousand years later

351
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,660
to the downward position

352
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,780
is here

353
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,780
Of course, I didn't want to post this picture.

354
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,220
when i put it in

355
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,820
Originally, President Wang Fu was not here to preside over the

356
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,860
So I boldly put it in

357
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,060
After he came

358
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,780
I have sent it to Mr. Hou

359
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,940
too late to withdraw

360
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,060
I know this picture is still a bit worse than his picture standard

361
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,220
But there are a lot of interesting things in this picture

362
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,340
did you notice

363
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,020
not just down toward him is in this totally in

364
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yellow River Basin

365
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
it

366
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Here is the Yellow River

367
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
it is the modern yellow river

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
did you notice

369
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The Yellow River and the Yangtze River are very different

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yangtze

371
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
look

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
messy little nearby

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
look small lake

374
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
They are actually big lakes

375
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You see the Yellow River is naked

376
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
not a single lake

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
it's interesting

378
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
until the Qin Dynasty

379
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This neighbor of the Qin Dynasty

380
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Everyone noticed that the Yellow River is still the main

381
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the yellow river is here

382
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
OK

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
this way

384
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Or the Yellow River

385
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yangtze river in

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
OK

387
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The Yangtze River has just begun to develop

388
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's Qin Dynasty

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So from just now BC

390
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
five thousand years to now

391
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
almost five thousand years

392
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Chinese culture has always been

393
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Mainly the Yellow River

394
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,360
But with the Yellow River as the center

395
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,960
See how the Yellow River treats the Chinese nation

396
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,840
Guide County near Qinghai

397
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,280
If people don't write this as the Yellow River

398
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,120
No matter how I guess, I can't guess that this is the Yellow River

399
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,840
Because you see the river is quite clear

400
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,160
It feels like swimming in summer

401
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
must be very enjoyable

402
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,920
But here is Qinghai

403
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,600
200 kilometers downstream of it

404
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,080
It's Lanzhou

405
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,320
Yellow River in Lanzhou

406
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,040
You see it's yellow

407
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,080
we can see how far it is

408
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,440
The picture of Qinghai is almost here on this machine

409
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
there here

410
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,160
The blue continent is a little bit above the red dot

411
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,080
So basically only the difference

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,440
About two or three hundred kilometers vary

413
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,080
So from the clear is

414
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,760
How do you say that is very clean

415
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,120
Do it right away, that is to say

416
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm totally loess in it

417
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,520
Well, we also have good statistics on this now.

418
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,640
Of course the Yellow River belongs to the Republic of China as we know it now

419
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,800
The Mother of Chinese Culture in the Republic of China and

420
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,920
That park was between 5,000 and 2,000 years ago

421
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
This has always been here

422
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,160
Actually we just saw

423
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:42,560
In fact, until the park

424
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,440
When talking about the Warring States Period

425
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,640
In the future, the Yellow River will still dominate

426
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
for the main place

427
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,440
as a center

428
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
But we know the historical record

429
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,760
Over the past 2,500 years or so

430
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,960
flooding of the yellow river

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
almost 1600 times

432
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Average 1.6 years

433
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
flood once

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
i think everyone knows

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Bo Yang

436
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Bo Yang just said

437
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The Yellow River is like a bird on the ground

438
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
writhing beautiful

439
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
dragon

440
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Bring us an irresistible disaster

441
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If the Yellow River says

442
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
really is

443
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
like this

444
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
i can't figure it out

445
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Ancestors of Huaxia

446
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
how would you think

447
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
ran to the edge of the Yellow River

448
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
to develop that culture

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I think

450
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
he this

451
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
IQ even me

452
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Of course, people's IQ has always been

453
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
enhanced

454
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
For example, here my IQ

455
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
should be relatively low

456
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Because everyone looks younger than me

457
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The younger generations are indeed

458
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
This IQ has been increasing

459
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
but our

460
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Chinese ancestors

461
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,160
No matter how low your IQ is, it won't be that low.

462
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,960
Let's say there is a big flood every year and a half

463
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,960
you are still there

464
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,920
develop your culture

465
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,480
This is very, very unreasonable

466
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
so i thought

467
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,440
When I was speaking this time, I thought

468
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,480
I want to discuss this issue with you.

469
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
look

470
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
We saw

471
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,800
That is to say, the Yellow River was long ago

472
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,280
5000 BC 2000 years ago

473
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,120
temperature we see

474
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,240
2 degrees C beyond the present

475
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,360
This is absolutely proven

476
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,840
over there

477
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,960
That is to say, digging out

478
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,360
have dug this fish

479
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,160
have dug this rhino

480
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,000
These are more tropical animals.

481
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,760
So the temperature at that time

482
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,600
The guess should be the guess should be no problem

483
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,200
The loess soil was originally very fertile.

484
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
easy to do

485
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,000
So at that time, there were actually many, many

486
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
favorable conditions

487
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,600
In addition, they mentioned that there is a saying in this ancient book

488
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,200
There are many large lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River

489
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,900
Just now I told you that there is no lake now

490
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
At that time many great lakes

491
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,500
Let's just say that the existence of the Great Lakes proves that

492
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,700
The Yellow River carries very little sediment

493
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,400
If there is a lot of sand

494
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,100
as now

495
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,300
any kind of lake

496
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,200
will be pre-qualified in a few years

497
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,600
So it shows that I was super late for this sentence at that time.

498
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,100
He said it showed that there was less rainstorm at that time

499
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,000
I said I've been raining for so long

500
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
How dare someone tell me

501
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,000
At that time the rainstorm was small

502
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
so it's very difficult

503
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,600
But his guess is very reasonable.

504
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,400
Because at that time since there was very little sediment

505
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
His torrential rain should be rare

506
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,800
Forest and grassland are all in good condition

507
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,700
That is to say at that time

508
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,400
I guess the Yellow River is clear

509
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,600
Of course when I write this clearly

510
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,800
This is also far

511
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,200
I know that our Vice President Wang is going to host

512
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,900
So I don't know if he will say later

513
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,100
You have a problem with this

514
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,900
But this thing

515
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,700
I believe this my past ah

516
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,500
Actually, it was actually when the Five Brothers of the Han Dynasty

517
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,100
That that was already in AD there

518
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,000
After AD, it is written in the whole article.

519
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,800
He doesn't have the name Huang He

520
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,400
And the river at that time was the Yellow River at that time

521
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,300
Collectively called the river, not the Yellow River

522
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,000
So it is likely that even when performing

523
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,300
This Yellow River may be a little yellow

524
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,180
But definitely not as yellow as today

525
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,900
OK

526
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,740
So this seems to make sense

527
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,420
except this

528
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,500
We actually had a recent

529
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,180
Ours is also why I put this

530
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,020
The reason this little history is here

531
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,060
Some of our recent research

532
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,580
sorry

533
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,780
I must have been pressing this thing

534
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,020
it doesn't work

535
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,100
back to the original

536
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,060
We did a recent study

537
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,820
That is to say, when the sea temperature in the tropics is relatively low,

538
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,540
in this case

539
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,660
Global rainfall intensity will decrease

540
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,380
That is to say, the rainstorm will decrease

541
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,020
And light rain is relatively less

542
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,340
in this case

543
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,180
It will provide more favorable rainfall conditions for Nongmu

544
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,980
This is an estimate we made

545
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,480
what does this picture represent

546
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,840
That is, we calculate the rainfall intensity

547
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:13,240
With low pseudo-degrees is the change in tropical ocean temperature

548
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,280
The intensity of the rainfall is here

549
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,800
Divide the global rainfall into 10 equal parts

550
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,200
The strongest rainfall is here

551
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,160
Minimal rainfall is here

552
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,440
That 10 is the top 10% of heavy rainfall

553
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
Did you see

554
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,000
If you increase the sea temperature by one degree

555
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,320
Its heavy rainfall will increase by almost 100%

556
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,520
You think the sea temperature at that time was cooler

557
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
if it's cold

558
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,480
In other words, the heavy rainfall should be smaller than the current

559
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,000
almost double

560
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,440
This means that at that time in the Yellow River Basin

561
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,520
The rain at that time was the kind of torrential rain.

562
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,640
much less than now

563
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,800
but light rain

564
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
light rain it will increase if it is cold

565
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,120
Here is the temperature increase it decreases

566
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,720
it increases when it is cold

567
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
Moderate rain will increase

568
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:18,920
So we all know that heavy rain is of course related to floods and landslides

569
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,240
So you reduce the risk of this flood

570
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,720
Moderate rain increases

571
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Moderate rain is an important moisture to keep the soil moist

572
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,680
It is also an important oxygen-containing edge for groundwater

573
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,280
Therefore, the increase of light rain can reduce sweating in

574
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,520
And it is very beneficial to the maintenance of deep drench and straight back

575
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,920
I make a picture here

576
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,400
Basically, it means that the tropical sea temperature is low

577
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,520
The intensity of the rainfall will decrease

578
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Light rain will increase, heavy rain will decrease

579
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,760
Of course, to use an old saying, it means good weather

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
in this case

581
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,500
The existence of creatures and lakes becomes possible

582
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,500
That is to say, the Yellow River was not yellow at that time.

583
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
Actually it makes sense

584
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
In terms of weather

585
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,000
The temperature of the original ocean

586
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,500
The ocean is cooler

587
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,500
OK Ocean temperatures at lower latitudes are cooler

588
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,500
this is a very important factor

589
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:42,500
We are thinking that reducing the intensity

590
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Then make soil and water conservation in the Yellow River Basin easier

591
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,500
That is to say, in the Yellow River Basin

592
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:00,500
That is to say, during this period

593
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,800
Gongyuan from 2000 to 5000 years

594
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
we can know

595
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,000
this is fertile soil

596
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
forest lake

597
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,800
very many

598
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,800
good weather

599
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,000
Yellow River becomes very reliable

600
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
No

601
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,800
Definitely not a flood every 1.6 years

602
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,600
I just said it

603
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,000
The temperature is relatively mild

604
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,400
This will become the kiln basket of Chinese culture

605
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
will also

606
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
that is

607
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,600
this is what i think

608
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:43,800
Why was the Yellow River chosen as the mother river of Chinese culture?

609
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:49,400
Here I mentioned heavy rain water control

610
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
That's what I'm talking about here

611
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
I said

612
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,400
For example, in 2000 BC

613
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,800
Also every 1.6 years on average

614
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Everyone

615
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,200
You can figure it out

616
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,800
He cured the water for 13 years

617
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,600
did not come home three times

618
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Did not go home three times

619
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
it is known

620
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,900
this 13 years

621
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,500
He should flood 8 times

622
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,500
ok

623
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,300
on basic statistics

624
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
that flooded 8 times

625
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,400
Think about it

626
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,100
No matter how hard you rain

627
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,900
But of course he succeeded

628
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,400
he his father failed

629
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,400
Everyone knows what the consequences are

630
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
then he succeeded

631
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,200
Is it really raining in the past

632
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,400
It is really better than the past 2000

633
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,600
Let's just say that the next 2500 years

634
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,200
The Yellow River floods all day long

635
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,300
The Yellow River has this all day long

636
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,000
dedicated person

637
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,700
smart man engineer

638
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,500
to control the Yellow River

639
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
bad governance

640
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,700
and he

641
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,600
You see heavy rain for 13 years

642
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
but all succeeded

643
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,000
so so i say

644
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,720
This is Holland Green

645
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,520
I believe this is not true

646
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,720
but i was guessing

647
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,120
My answer is to say

648
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,040
Within 13 years of heavy rain and stagnant water

649
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,760
like we just said

650
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,800
good weather basically

651
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,920
Of course there are occasional small floods

652
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
maybe once or twice

653
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,440
that it this

654
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,400
and high technology

655
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,640
then try very hard

656
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,400
once or twice, of course

657
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,360
it passed

658
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,000
I also think it's the right time and place

659
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,160
all helped it

660
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
Of course it won't work if it doesn't work hard

661
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,880
But the so-called heavy rain

662
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,680
It should be mostly its luck

663
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,120
i'm guessing

664
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,600
instead of saying its 13 years

665
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,480
it's really governed so well

666
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
suppose it's that powerful

667
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,080
and it that method

668
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,880
I also know later

669
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,760
next 2500 years

670
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,720
that is to say those people

671
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,760
such a smart person

672
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,200
There should be a way

673
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
governance success

674
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
so i believe

675
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,960
From this logic

676
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,720
indeed in

677
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,040
that is

678
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,160
When ancient civilizations developed

679
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,560
that

680
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,000
at that time

681
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,440
Climatic conditions

682
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,480
That is to say, the conditions of rainfall

683
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,640
is far better than

684
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,320
far than

685
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,200
that is

686
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,440
past

687
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,960
over 2000 years

688
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,320
well done

689
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,760
then finish the story

690
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
everyone is fine

691
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
here

692
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,280
because I can't wait

693
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,080
tell these historical things

694
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,840
if there is a problem

695
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,640
can now bring it up

696
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,760
Then we seem to have quite a long time today

697
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,280
seems to be every time

698
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,880
ah

699
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,400
right

700
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,960
have a lot of time

701
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,960
so everyone has a problem

702
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
mention at any time

703
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,640
ah

704
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,400
i think this is very

705
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,080
very interesting

706
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,160
hear the story

707
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,960
that's in

708
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,400
The Yangtze River We know that the Yangtze River was 50 or 60 years ago

709
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,240
It was clear before

710
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,740
Clear and without yellow sand

711
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,440
but now

712
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
It's like turning into the Yellow River

713
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,940
the main reason

714
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,940
Of course it's because of the development

715
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,440
Cut down the upper forest

716
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,440
and then developed a variety of uses

717
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
So resulting in the current

718
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,440
The Yangtze River is also changing

719
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,940
So this of course this could be

720
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,940
because time is short

721
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,940
this big change happened

722
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,940
Maybe it's not about the climate

723
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,440
Then the change in the Yellow River changes from clear to yellow

724
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,940
Is it also because of the impact of development?

725
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,940
i think it's right

726
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,940
That is to say, from clear to yellow

727
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,940
It's not just natural reasons

728
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
that natural cause i believe

729
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,940
indeed there are

730
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,940
The climate is changing

731
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,940
OK

732
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,920
The reason may be more important

733
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,920
you talk

734
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,080
Ask me if the Yellow River is really turning yellow because of man-made

735
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,760
or natural reasons

736
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,680
I believe that although I would like to have

737
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,880
However, there should be more human reasons

738
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,560
Population after the Warring States Period

739
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,680
not after the Warring States Period

740
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,480
After the Qing Dynasty

741
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,920
The population is increasing very fast

742
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,080
Especially when the country begins to unify

743
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,440
start getting bigger

744
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,400
growing population

745
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,360
Lin Kan speaks very, very fast

746
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Soil and water conservation is more difficult

747
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,640
but i can say

748
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,800
Even the Yellow River

749
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,160
We're going back now to keep it hydrated

750
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,320
it can actually recover to

751
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,800
That is to say, the coverage of forest and grassland is everywhere.

752
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
i actually have

753
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,240
because of its climate now

754
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,120
very unsuitable

755
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,840
This is my forest and grassland

756
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,440
that's my kind of coverage

757
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,160
yes no more questions yet

758
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,280
so no words

759
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,720
I think I will introduce to you

760
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,440
That means returning

761
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,280
Back to the question we started to talk about today

762
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,880
That is to say spring and autumn warming

763
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,600
Impact on Taiwan

764
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,640
before speaking

765
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,520
I thought I'd better introduce

766
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,280
What is the difference between weather and climate

767
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,520
because it is often misunderstood

768
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,760
Look at the weather in general

769
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,960
I am a more general definition

770
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,960
In fact, there is no very strict definition

771
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,000
Generally the weather is

772
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,760
The short-term state and change of the air

773
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,040
In the short term we generally

774
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,120
say within 10 days

775
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,800
Basically within 10 days

776
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,920
why use 10 days

777
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,200
The main thing is that we now

778
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,560
best weather forecaster

779
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,120
Basically can only predict 10 days

780
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,200
10 days later

781
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,040
Talking about the weather is useless

782
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,000
The weather you guessed, the weather he told

783
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,880
exactly the same

784
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,800
It's all 50% right and 50% wrong

785
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,920
so this we mean the weather

786
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,000
That example is what the temperature will be tomorrow

787
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,720
The weather today is bad

788
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,040
the climate is very different

789
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,080
Climate is the long-term average of weather

790
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,560
This long term has a certain definition

791
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,440
World Meteorological Organization definition

792
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,160
long term is 30 years

793
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,560
That means you have 30 years of data

794
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,800
you are qualified to say

795
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,520
I have a climate value for this

796
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,560
For example, if we say that the global average

797
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,280
The temperature is 15 degrees

798
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,840
That means we at least have a past

799
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,960
30 years of data

800
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,360
to average out this 15 degrees

801
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,040
Of course we have hundreds of years of data

802
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,960
How many typhoons come to Taiwan every year

803
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,720
We've certainly had good weather this year

804
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,320
lucky only one

805
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,640
But does anyone know how many typhoons we have on average?

806
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,280
does anyone have a guess

807
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,960
alone air does not count

808
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,440
seven

809
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,640
no one has to guess

810
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,280
We have an average of four typhoons a year

811
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,040
Qingtai

812
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,040
There is also a definition

813
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,280
What is typhoon Qingtai?

814
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,800
The Bureau of Meteorology issued a warning on the road.

815
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,760
Even before it arrived in Taiwan

816
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,520
It's okay to turn a corner and walk away

817
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,800
continue

818
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,480
you are not there yet

819
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,180
Won't

820
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,700
I you are moving

821
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,740
it's gonna be the last chance

822
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,320
There are almost four a year

823
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,080
We only have one this year

824
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,040
it was better for us then

825
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,120
and additionally

826
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,400
typhoon four typhoon

827
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
An average of four typhoons a year

828
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,120
It brings us almost 40 percent of our rainfall

829
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,200
So if you say that it is a good thing that the typhoon does not come

830
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,080
that's totally wrong

831
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,560
It's a bad thing if the typhoon doesn't come

832
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,440
If none of the four typhoons comes

833
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,520
Forty percent of our annual rain is gone

834
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,880
60% left

835
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,880
The second year of spring plowing guarantees that you can do nothing

836
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,800
In fact, this year we can say that luck is the best.

837
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,880
Several typhoons are coming

838
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,560
just wipe it on the side

839
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,400
bring us a lot of rain

840
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,400
I still remember when the first typhoon came

841
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,480
Seems like we were heading for a drought

842
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,080
Then there is a typhoon coming

843
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,800
become rainy

844
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,800
There are several typhoons this year

845
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,120
that said it brought the rain

846
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,680
But it didn't bring anything special, just more rain

847
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,040
Of course there will be disasters

848
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,880
After we make this definition

849
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,480
Many questions we can understand very quickly

850
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,640
because the media often say

851
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,440
Just like there were several weather events in previous winters

852
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,480
very heavy snow and cold

853
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,600
Then some media said

854
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,920
Are we going into Xiaoice and Qi?

855
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,040
Everyone knows this definition

856
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,360
Xiaobing and the flag are hundreds of years old

857
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,400
one or two hundred years

858
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,320
its a climate event

859
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,680
This is a few weather events

860
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,520
two are not the same

861
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,800
So of course it doesn't mean

862
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,000
In addition, this particular event

863
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,600
Morakot European heatwave

864
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Said to be caused by climate warming

865
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,000
Why

866
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,600
Because this is still a few weather events

867
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:14,400
And climate warming is a climate problem

868
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,400
Even without climate warming

869
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,200
We also know that typhoons like Morakot

870
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
There is still a chance to come to Taiwan

871
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
not no

872
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,200
OK

873
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,600
africa europe heatwave

874
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,800
There is also a chance

875
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,000
it's not without

876
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,600
but what can we say

877
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,400
in the context of climate warming

878
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,000
I'll show you here

879
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,600
We used to be in Taiwan

880
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:49,200
Analyze data from 1961 to 2005

881
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Do an average every 10 years

882
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,000
Then do an analysis of rainfall intensity

883
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,600
here is heavy rain

884
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,400
This is cat cat rain

885
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,000
OK

886
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
On average, people can see different colors every ten years

887
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,400
The most recent is only five years

888
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
2001 to 2005

889
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,400
You can see that heavy rainfall is increasing

890
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,000
With the age because it is getting hotter

891
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
OK increases with temperature

892
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,400
While light rain decreases with temperature

893
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
very obvious

894
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
For Typhoon Morakot

895
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,400
This picture makes sense

896
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,400
Everyone noticed that the average rainfall in Morakot

897
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,200
It's about 40 mm per hour

898
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
40 kilometers

899
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,600
40 kilometers per hour

900
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,000
rain like this

901
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,800
Between 1961 and 1970

902
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,400
You see, it is almost equal to non-existence

903
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,900
But after 45 years

904
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,000
You can see that it has increased by almost

905
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,700
at least three times

906
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,000
then you can

907
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,320
so to speak

908
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,320
Of course, what I'm talking about now is more general.

909
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,120
That is to say

910
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,080
Morakot

911
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,560
rain like this typhoon Morakot

912
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,480
now than before

913
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,280
Its thirst rate increased

914
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,120
and increased considerably

915
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,600
possibly several times

916
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,880
So from this point of view

917
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,760
we can talk

918
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,800
That is, this single event

919
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,880
relationship with climate warming

920
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,840
Speaking of climate warming, of course

921
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,720
We still have to introduce the greenhouse effect

922
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,920
greenhouse effect

923
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,280
The most obvious greenhouse effect

924
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,200
that is

925
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,080
If there were no greenhouse gases

926
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,840
average temperature of our planet

927
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,480
It should be minus 19 degrees

928
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,880
It is easy to calculate it with the formula of physics

929
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,760
but we are now

930
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,000
just now we saw

931
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,880
The global average temperature is 15 degrees

932
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,840
So the greenhouse gas greenhouse effect

933
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,240
gives us 34 degrees

934
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,960
that is

935
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
very high temperature

936
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,400
The main greenhouse gases of the earth are as follows:

937
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,400
Among them, what everyone often hears is Jiawan, which loves to raise carbon dioxide.

938
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,000
less commonly heard is water vapor

939
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Water vapor is actually one of the most important greenhouse gases

940
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,600
It says it's inside 34 degrees

941
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,600
its very rough estimate

942
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,200
it accounts for at least half

943
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,200
It occupies half because of water

944
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,600
water vapor relationship

945
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,200
Others are relatively few

946
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,200
But why don't we hear the water

947
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,600
Because mainly water is not affected by water in the air

948
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,600
unaffected by human activities

949
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
so we got lucky

950
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,000
water untouched by us

951
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If it is really influenced by us

952
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,000
that's really

953
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,200
it's a big deal

954
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,480
But these other

955
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,520
Ozone

956
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,480
effector

957
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,280
are all affected by human activities

958
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,200
and have now increased a lot

959
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,680
Especially the armor pill increased

960
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,320
I'm afraid there are three times

961
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,960
tripled

962
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,520
The others are also adding considerable numbers

963
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,440
we can see here

964
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,200
You see when Komaru starts here

965
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,920
Kamaru is here

966
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,120
It was only less than 600

967
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,720
500

968
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,160
How much has it increased now

969
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,520
almost 2000

970
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,760
nearly quadrupled

971
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,800
dark carbon dioxide increase

972
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,120
are also very obvious

973
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,920
effector increased significantly

974
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,400
This is the year 2000

975
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,640
this

976
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:58,840
right

977
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,160
This is web recovery

978
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,720
Push is 2000 years ago is here

979
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,720
Of course everyone will say

980
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,400
we have everything to cool now

981
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,280
How did this get cold?

982
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
Does anyone know this

983
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,840
no one dozed off

984
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,040
so i ask the question

985
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,920
smile is not big

986
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,840
sometimes someone dozes off

987
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,840
I asked him

988
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,960
he woke up immediately

989
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,760
this is very effective

990
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,360
Everyone seems to be paying attention today

991
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,160
this thing like this currently

992
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,200
In fact, it is also a method that has only recently begun to be discovered.

993
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,400
I remember it was in the 70s that I started to know how to cool

994
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:57,400
That is to say, the Greenland or Antarctic

995
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
his ice

996
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Hit one to knock down that icicle

997
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
call up

998
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,200
Drill down and pull that icicle out

999
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,400
its icicles

1000
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,100
Especially the icicles in Antarctica

1001
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,400
Antarctic snowfall is very slow

1002
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,000
Icicles are formed from what would have been snow

1003
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The snow pressure of snow pressure will be there in the future

1004
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,200
crushed into ice

1005
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,000
OK

1006
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,100
when pressed into ice

1007
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,800
Everyone knows that between snow and snow

1008
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,400
it has bubbles

1009
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,600
that bubble it is preserved

1010
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,000
that little bubble

1011
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
ice bubbles

1012
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,200
you are deeper

1013
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,600
Of course the longer the history

1014
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,400
You take those air bubbles out of the ice

1015
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,200
take the air bubbles out

1016
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,400
There are bubbles in there

1017
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,100
Carbon dioxide can cool down

1018
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,400
That's carbon dioxide

1019
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,600
Now we can put this

1020
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,800
Just say ice core

1021
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,800
This can always be done

1022
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,000
Almost almost a million years ago

1023
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
already

1024
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,200
so say

1025
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,200
Of course, only about

1026
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,400
400,000 years around 500,000 years

1027
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,500
But there is hope to see

1028
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:15,000
How much carbonized carbon was there 1 million years ago

1029
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,000
The effect of greenhouse gases on the temperature of the world

1030
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,200
The most obvious and best example is this graph

1031
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,900
OK this picture is also currently

1032
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,000
just say

1033
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,700
Speaking of the current temperature increase

1034
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,000
Mainly man-made greenhouse gases

1035
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,900
the result of the greenhouse effect of that effect

1036
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,400
most important one argument

1037
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
what is this

1038
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,200
The black line represents

1039
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,000
Past observed temperature global

1040
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,600
average change in temperature

1041
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,680
What about the blue line?

1042
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,600
The blue one is not a line

1043
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,480
What about the blue one?

1044
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,600
It means using this climate model

1045
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,400
take this increase in greenhouse gases

1046
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,120
It is entirely assumed that there is no increase

1047
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,400
Greenhouse gas assumptions have not changed at all

1048
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,840
calculated global temperature

1049
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,040
What about the purple one?

1050
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,880
That is to say, the increase of this greenhouse gas

1051
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,440
it's that influence put in

1052
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,480
The results obtained

1053
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,640
everyone can see

1054
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,520
observed temperature

1055
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,000
is related to this greenhouse gas

1056
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,400
This degree of mildness is quite high

1057
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,920
Of course everyone also noticed

1058
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,640
Here's something that doesn't match

1059
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Doesn't match any pattern

1060
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,960
That means

1061
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,440
our climate change

1062
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,680
Although speaking now

1063
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,440
Efforts over the past few decades have made great progress

1064
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,880
But there are still some places we don't know very well

1065
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,960
What is the real reason for the temperature change

1066
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:19,240
It is still a point of contention that everyone pays attention to.

1067
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:28,320
This graph is for the most important climate changes observed in the past

1068
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,480
As a result, it is always a relatively small section.

1069
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,000
The temperature change just above

1070
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,960
Temperature changes from the beginning of the thermometer almost 1850

1071
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,560
still have a thermometer

1072
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,800
This is the increase in global temperature

1073
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,760
The thing I just talked about is here

1074
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:54,840
The second graph is sea level rise

1075
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,960
Sea-level rise

1076
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,240
This rising 100-year phenomenon

1077
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,080
Let's say linear from 1900 to 2000

1078
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,280
The value is almost 0.6 degrees

1079
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:16,080
If you use linear to measure sea level

1080
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,960
Its increase is almost 15 cm

1081
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,360
15 cm is not very high

1082
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,160
actually

1083
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:28,880
This image shows snow cover in the northern hemisphere

1084
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,960
Let's talk about this when we have time

1085
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,400
Although this is more time today

1086
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,360
Or let me see when I speak at 7 o'clock

1087
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,480
It's almost 50 minutes now

1088
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,960
ah i remember

1089
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,600
supposedly 90 minutes

1090
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,440
within 90 minutes

1091
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,680
OK, 40 minutes left

1092
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,880
ah

1093
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,120
Just now

1094
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,600
we see the temperature increase

1095
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,600
is here

1096
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,000
That is to say, the part with the red line

1097
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,100
ok

1098
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,500
Set it here

1099
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,200
This picture is from the past 2000 years

1100
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,000
Ours is now in 2000

1101
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
That means 11 years ago here in 2000

1102
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,200
The average global temperature over the past 1000 years

1103
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,400
picture of

1104
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,700
ok, the part with red line means we have

1105
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,700
There are real instruments to measure the results

1106
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,900
I just saw what you saw

1107
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,700
just now everyone saw

1108
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,300
Make this and that coordinate very large

1109
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,500
That coordinates are squeezed here

1110
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,300
You see 1900 is here

1111
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,400
that is here

1112
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,700
The pattern I just talked about

1113
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:54,200
There's no way to grind your little feet up here

1114
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,900
ok

1115
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,900
So this is the red part is modern

1116
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,900
that front

1117
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,440
Almost 900 years have been made by other methods

1118
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,840
these other ways to get out

1119
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,520
I believe

1120
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,400
I don't want to ask

1121
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,920
Does anyone know of any other methods that are most commonly used

1122
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,800
Other methods most commonly used

1123
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,720
In fact, we have a lot of them in Taiwan.

1124
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,760
That is to say, there is a lot of information

1125
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,480
But I haven't entered the picture yet.

1126
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,280
That is to say, the annual rings of the tree

1127
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,080
Tree rings are a very important

1128
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,520
can be used for you to see we also know a lot about trees

1129
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,200
Trees in Taiwan are thousands of years old

1130
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,920
So the tree rings give us a lot of data

1131
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,040
In addition, of course the refrigerator I just mentioned

1132
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:10,000
It is the kind of data for higher latitudes

1133
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
In addition there are some data

1134
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
actually use this rock

1135
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Rock because it conducts heat very slowly

1136
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
after you drill it down

1137
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
its past temperature

1138
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
temperature at the depth of the rock

1139
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
It can be obtained from the previous temperature

1140
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So here are some so-called alternative materials

1141
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
made out of

1142
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
You can also see the uncertainty of modern times

1143
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
gray part

1144
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The gray part gets bigger the farther you go

1145
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The greater the uncertainty

1146
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But you can also notice

1147
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
This thing still looks pretty sophisticated

1148
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
because you look at 0.5 degrees

1149
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
is so big

1150
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,500
So this looks pretty useful

1151
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,500
correct

1152
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,000
But of course this means

1153
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,500
Said to say the past

1154
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
one thousand years

1155
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
The temperature basically does not change much

1156
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Although a little less

1157
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But this reduced value

1158
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Just around 0.1 0.2 degrees

1159
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,500
And this 100 years

1160
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
Suddenly increased by 0.6 degrees

1161
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,000
So this shows more

1162
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,500
In other words, the unusualness of this temperature increase

1163
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,000
That also means that it is more likely

1164
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
most likely caused by human activities

1165
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,000
Almost everything I just said has been observed in the past.

1166
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
that climate change

1167
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,500
Climate Change in the 21st Century

1168
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,000
of course we have nothing

1169
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,500
no observational data

1170
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,500
only by this mode

1171
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,500
that pattern

1172
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,000
Predicting the 21st Century

1173
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,600
Global warming is 3 to 6 times that of the 20th century

1174
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,320
3 to 6 times of 0.6 is almost 1.8

1175
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,160
That is to say, 2 degrees to 4 degrees

1176
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,320
I told you when I started

1177
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,240
There are about 2 degrees to 4 degrees

1178
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,880
What about greenhouse gases

1179
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,200
Sea level rise is basically 20 cm to 60 cm

1180
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,120
The media often say 4 to 8 meters

1181
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,920
And then said that Taipei is gone

1182
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,920
Kaohsiung is gone

1183
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,600
I can type this question, I really want to ask

1184
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,800
hands up

1185
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,200
A few people saw the government's 2 degrees C

1186
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,600
i'm quite a lot

1187
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,000
nearly half

1188
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,800
The government's 2 degrees C should have a positive effect on adults

1189
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,800
I've heard it's often

1190
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,000
Even primary schools have to go to see the government 2 degrees C

1191
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
middle school let alone

1192
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,120
The government's second-degree district almost sees it every day

1193
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,840
Then I think it should be harmful to them

1194
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,680
why come

1195
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,320
Because of the government's second-degree zone although it has many positive effects

1196
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,960
He said when you miss his handprint

1197
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,400
Dean Wuyue has all gone

1198
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,360
i was invited

1199
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,760
But my position is far behind

1200
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,320
very back

1201
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:26,920
that

1202
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,200
but

1203
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,080
this

1204
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,720
Ms. Chen Wenqian actually ran up to shake hands

1205
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,720
but that's no use

1206
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,880
I wrote one the next day

1207
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,720
not the next day

1208
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,120
On the third day, I wrote an article saying

1209
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,080
why there

1210
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,840
most important

1211
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,440
The information is actually wrong

1212
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,880
The most important information in it is

1213
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:51,960
With me

1214
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,120
I said hear this

1215
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,960
he spoke

1216
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,280
That means the sea level will rise six meters

1217
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,320
Then it is said that it is likely to rise by 6 meters in 2035

1218
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,560
I'll just say you hypothetically really believe in 2035

1219
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,800
If the sea level were to rise six meters

1220
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,160
you go home and see the one in your house

1221
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,840
How far is it from sea level now

1222
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,080
Average distance from sea level to Taipei

1223
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,480
Only four meters above sea level

1224
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,800
The average means that half of the people are within four meters.

1225
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,160
Let alone six meters

1226
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,120
How much is left in 2035

1227
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,480
How much is ten or twenty left?

1228
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,280
twenty four years

1229
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,240
Suppose my twenty-four years later

1230
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,880
if my house will be under the sea

1231
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,680
Then I'll sell the house right now

1232
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,080
Otherwise, when you see it, everyone will sell you

1233
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,080
money is gone

1234
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:55,920
I can not afford it

1235
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,080
so so but that's fine too

1236
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,080
That is to say, so many of us

1237
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
everyone went to see

1238
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
People rarely think about selling their house.

1239
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
So it means that our education level in Taiwan

1240
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
It is indeed relatively high

1241
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
have your own judgment

1242
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
this is very important

1243
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Actually, I'm not just a joke

1244
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
i traveled a lot

1245
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
In fact, we are Taiwan

1246
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
This level of education

1247
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Everyone's attempt is relatively high

1248
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I tell you it is definitely taller than Americans

1249
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
american until now

1250
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You see, 40% of people believe

1251
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
that what

1252
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
when our world began

1253
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
almost 4000 years ago

1254
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
He still believes so

1255
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Let alone how he would believe

1256
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
this greenhouse gas

1257
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
these things

1258
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,600
This sea level is rising

1259
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,000
4 to 8 meters

1260
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,400
This is needed

1261
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,200
At least like that whole pawn in Greenland

1262
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,600
Soldiers on land melt

1263
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,200
That pawn melted

1264
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,800
It is estimated that the total melting is 7 meters

1265
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:21,600
If it is said that the soldiers in Antarctica melted a part

1266
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,200
Then that will be 4 to 8 meters beyond this

1267
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,000
OK

1268
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,800
But this

1269
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,000
Soldiers in Greenland and the Melting of Soldiers in Antarctica

1270
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
current melting rate

1271
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Some say fast, some say slow

1272
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
This is currently very uncertain

1273
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,800
Of course, this variable value is very large

1274
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,200
The indeterminate value is large

1275
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,800
Nor can it be exaggerated to say that it is unlimited

1276
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,500
ah

1277
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,300
There are many problems in this aspect of Zhenfu Erdu

1278
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:57,100
As for the dean of his fifteenth hospital, he is aware of the importance of this issue

1279
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,900
that i believe that is a very good

1280
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
result

1281
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
21st Century Climate Change

1282
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
In addition, of course, the number of extremely high temperature days will increase.

1283
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Decrease in the number of extremely low temperature days

1284
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
drought will be worse

1285
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
it's a sure thing

1286
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
In addition it has

1287
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
This is of course taken from the IPCC

1288
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
That is to say

1289
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
the one from the intergovernment group

1290
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
climate panel results

1291
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
it was originally in 2007

1292
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The next one is to talk about in 2014

1293
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
to bring up

1294
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
In 2007 it also said

1295
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Typhoons and torrential rains are likely to increase

1296
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
will be more serious

1297
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Now basically it's been

1298
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
think this part

1299
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
typhoons will increase

1300
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
or worse

1301
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I don't think it's clear now

1302
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
But the rain will increase

1303
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
wait for us

1304
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Of course the question

1305
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
discuss with you

1306
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
The increase in temperature just mentioned

1307
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
it is mainly

1308
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,520
To see how we reduce greenhouse gases

1309
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,920
how to decide

1310
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,880
will increase the minimum temperature by 1.8 degrees

1311
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,480
is called B1

1312
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,480
it is very optimistic

1313
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,280
that is

1314
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,880
current carbon dioxide

1315
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,960
Current global average emissions

1316
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,200
is almost 4 metric tons

1317
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,120
basically means

1318
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,720
we start now

1319
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,520
Keep at 4 metric tons per person

1320
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,840
assuming that

1321
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,760
we can keep in

1322
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,480
The temperature increase will only reach 1.8 degrees

1323
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,160
in this case

1324
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,360
by 2100

1325
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,720
CO2 will only increase to 450 PPM

1326
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,440
It's almost 400 now

1327
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,840
So this seems unlikely

1328
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,880
will definitely exceed

1329
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,600
more than one case

1330
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,280
called A2 case

1331
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,000
Name case

1332
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,600
basically follow nature

1333
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,560
Don't worry about it

1334
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,920
continue to emit greenhouse gases

1335
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,400
in that case

1336
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,160
In 210 it loves carbon dioxide

1337
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,200
would increase to almost 840 PPM

1338
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,880
That is three times the pre-industrial revolution

1339
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,000
in this case

1340
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,560
Global warming is almost four degrees

1341
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,160
This is of course what I just mentioned

1342
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,880
The situation of B1 and A2 mentioned to you

1343
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,360
Let's draw the picture just now

1344
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:39,640
On the map of 1000 years ago

1345
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:43,240
What we just saw was 1000 years

1346
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,200
then 100 years

1347
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,480
Now add another 100 years

1348
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,360
is here

1349
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,200
Everyone noticed this rise

1350
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,280
it feels pretty scary

1351
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,960
from this angle

1352
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,000
This estimate of sea level rise

1353
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,120
also estimated

1354
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:07,720
The current one, of course, is what we just saw

1355
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,000
Using the results obtained in the last century

1356
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,280
This is the predicted result

1357
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,440
This forecast is the IPCC's 2007 forecast

1358
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:25,640
Later at the meeting in Copenhagen

1359
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:32,120
An impromptu estimate of sea level rise

1360
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:37,160
There are some people who think that the sea level will rise faster

1361
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,040
make an estimate

1362
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,920
even faster people

1363
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,160
did you notice

1364
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,440
By the year 2000, they estimate, of course, there are uncertainties

1365
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,400
At most, it is slightly more than one meter to 2000 years

1366
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,680
His middle point is still less than a meter

1367
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,480
Still less than a meter

1368
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,720
that

1369
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,880
rather than

1370
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,400
Both are 6 meters

1371
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,600
6 meters as mentioned by IPCC

1372
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,600
is problematic

1373
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,600
Of course centuries later

1374
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,600
Will it be 6 meters

1375
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:21,000
i think about greenhouse gases

1376
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,400
if you continue

1377
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,400
centuries later

1378
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,000
Of course it is possible to increase to 6 meters

1379
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,400
but we also know

1380
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,000
in petroleum gas

1381
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,400
I'm afraid before 2050

1382
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,400
basically

1383
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,200
No LOT of Petroleum Gas

1384
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
ready to dig

1385
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,200
the coal itself

1386
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,200
Of course there are almost 100 more years

1387
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,400
can dig

1388
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,200
but by then

1389
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,800
carbon dioxide emissions

1390
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,000
It is very uncertain

1391
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
so this

1392
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
that is to say centuries later

1393
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,360
This layout is very stable

1394
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,240
That use value is very small

1395
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,400
I just talked about global issues

1396
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,000
here back to us Taiwan

1397
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,240
Our Taiwan has increased in the past almost 100 years

1398
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,240
The temperature increase is applied on the

1399
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,040
that past 100 years

1400
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,640
That 100+ year global temperature increase is undercoated

1401
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:30,880
you can see

1402
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,280
it looks like that

1403
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,840
First a temperature increase

1404
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,040
then relatively flat

1405
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,840
Then another temperature increase

1406
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,440
this looks like

1407
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,240
This also means that we Taiwan is part of the global warming

1408
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,040
But our warming

1409
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:51,840
Let’s talk about it carefully to see how much it heats up

1410
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,160
is global warming

1411
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,440
Let's say the 20th century was almost twice the global warming

1412
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,600
The reason is now quite clear to us

1413
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:08,600
Mainly due to the influence of urban heat conduction effect

1414
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,600
Influence of Urban Thermal Conductivity Effect

1415
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:16,000
also takes us from 1961 to the present

1416
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
almost 50 years

1417
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,600
our main warming

1418
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,400
Taiwan mainly heats up at night

1419
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,700
rarely heats up during the day

1420
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,400
it's very interesting

1421
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,400
OK

1422
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,400
wait we can see

1423
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,200
in addition

1424
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,400
is that our rainfall intensity is changing

1425
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,400
this is my personal opinion

1426
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,800
Let's assume we're really worried about things in Taiwan

1427
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,000
It's a matter of rainfall intensity

1428
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:49,400
The intensity of the rainfall and the heat wave

1429
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,400
are all changes that can be called extreme weather

1430
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,400
we know extreme weather is random

1431
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,400
This global warming changes

1432
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,560
The most obvious one is of course a heat wave.

1433
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,560
The change of that heavy rain and light rain

1434
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:07,960
Also extreme weather changes

1435
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,240
What about this change?

1436
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,680
From the point of view of this pattern

1437
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:15,880
is very very difficult to predict

1438
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,840
that almost all patterns

1439
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,480
There will be problems in this area

1440
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,480
so what

1441
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,960
This IPCC

1442
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,080
The impact of this extreme weather

1443
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,560
Although there are

1444
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,000
have done this for sure

1445
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,520
It will become more and more powerful

1446
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,040
But he is still quite conservative

1447
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,640
wait a minute we can see

1448
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,840
why is it like this

1449
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,120
Ah Taiwan heat wave

1450
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,520
This is us

1451
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,640
One made in 2009

1452
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,640
That Causa is our Posta Xu Qianzhong

1453
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,120
Then there is Chen Zhengping, a professor at National Taiwan University.

1454
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,160
That

1455
01:08:58,320 --> 01:08:59,640
here it is

1456
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,160
Taiwan

1457
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,400
But from 1961 to 2005

1458
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,300
45-year mean temperature change

1459
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,400
it's daytime

1460
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,600
bottom is night

1461
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,400
blue is to reduce the temperature

1462
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,800
red is to increase the temperature

1463
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,300
Everyone knows it at a glance

1464
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,900
increase temperature at night

1465
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,000
especially ayutthaya

1466
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,600
increased temperature during the day

1467
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,200
real decent increase

1468
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,400
only this station

1469
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,800
Only the station is 3.5 kilometers away from the budget

1470
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,400
Of course he does not represent Taiwan

1471
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,000
he actually represents

1472
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,400
Represents the change in temperature over a large area

1473
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
So if you take Yushan away

1474
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,800
Average daytime temperature in Taiwan

1475
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,200
actually cooling down

1476
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,800
What is the real reason for the cooling

1477
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,500
We also have quite a large thinning now

1478
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,600
It's the polluted gas that we exhale

1479
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:49,800
polluted gas

1480
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,900
reflect sunlight back during the day

1481
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,000
so we environmental rats

1482
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,000
working harder now

1483
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
They really worked hard

1484
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,800
Taiwan's pollution is getting less and less

1485
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,080
look carefully

1486
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,440
especially taipei

1487
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,840
In the past 15 or 20 years in Taipei

1488
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,360
Especially the reduction of this preemptive pollution

1489
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:17,880
more than doubled

1490
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,240
so this is pretty good

1491
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,760
But it also means

1492
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,080
In the future we will be more and more

1493
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,440
The EPA is getting harder

1494
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,400
What we pay will go back to the card

1495
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,080
OK

1496
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:33,480
At night because the sun has no effect

1497
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:37,240
night temperature global warming

1498
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,080
heated

1499
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,480
Then there is the thermal conduction effect also heating up

1500
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,080
So it gets hotter at night

1501
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,480
look at taipei

1502
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:51,040
Between 45 years

1503
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,600
45 years of global increase

1504
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,520
A staggering 0.5 degrees increase

1505
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,600
Here it increases almost 2 degrees

1506
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,960
2 degrees increase at night

1507
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,480
The result in Taipei was quite a bad result

1508
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:09,040
As you can see, Taiwan is Taiwan without Taipei.

1509
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,800
This is a different place in Taiwan as a whole

1510
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,800
Different colors represent different places

1511
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,040
Minimum temperature over 25 at night

1512
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,400
number of days in a year

1513
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,200
OK

1514
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,640
Blue represents Taipei

1515
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,920
did you notice

1516
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:26,680
look

1517
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,720
It's over 25 degrees tonight

1518
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,480
Said it was over 25 degrees outside

1519
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,000
It must be definitely over 26 degrees in there

1520
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,280
The government even allows you to turn on the air conditioner

1521
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,560
So at that time, everyone must turn on the air-conditioning

1522
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,600
This air-conditioned night from before 1960

1523
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,840
There are only more than 30 days when the air conditioner needs to be turned on at night

1524
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,320
Now you see more than 100 days

1525
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,960
Taipei needs to turn on the air conditioner at night

1526
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,320
tripled

1527
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:00,080
This actually affects

1528
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
very huge

1529
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Just say no wonder our Aiyanghua carbon brand

1530
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Everyone's brand is better than the whole world

1531
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
How much more are we than the world average

1532
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Does anyone know

1533
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
three times

1534
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
someone knows this

1535
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
three times

1536
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
This is also one of the reasons

1537
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
look

1538
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Taiwan in summer

1539
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
The air conditioner is basically turned on everywhere at night

1540
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
that all

1541
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
The other two big cities are not much better

1542
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Black

1543
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
the second most increased

1544
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
The same goes for Tainan and Taichung

1545
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Almost all Taiwan

1546
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
The phenomenon of drinking more and drinking less

1547
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Although urban

1548
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
I just said that it is urban heat conduction effect

1549
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
But for us in Taiwan as a whole

1550
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
because of the population density

1551
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
We have all guides

1552
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
The tendency of the kind of thermal conduction effect

1553
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
time relationship

1554
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I won't show you this picture

1555
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,400
Tell me about the heat island effect

1556
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,060
This is Chuo University Shake Center

1557
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:08,260
Provided by Professor Liu

1558
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,000
This is Taichung area

1559
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,660
you see build plants

1560
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:14,260
Paddy field next to Dadu West

1561
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:17,660
You see purple against this dark green

1562
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,000
dark green here purple

1563
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,460
about six degrees

1564
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,260
This is a very cold effect

1565
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:26,660
daytime

1566
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,300
daytime heat wave

1567
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:29,260
OK

1568
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:33,760
At one point we said that the EPA said it was going to put a heat wave rack

1569
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,460
or when the heat wave comes

1570
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:40,260
outdoor sports

1571
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,260
Manual workers get a raise

1572
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:47,360
I will show him this about our Taiwan

1573
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,260
Days when the temperature exceeds 36 degrees

1574
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:52,460
Also different colors and different places

1575
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,560
The real high temperature exceeds 36 degrees

1576
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,360
looks a bit increased

1577
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,160
The obvious increase is my blue desk

1578
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,280
Taipei is Taipei

1579
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:04,000
Then, just look at the words of Taipei

1580
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Of course it's not about global warming.

1581
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,320
It is all related to the thermal conductivity effect

1582
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,480
and the increase is not so large

1583
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,880
Because this is 36 degrees

1584
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,480
If you say it is 38 degrees

1585
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,960
I believe this is not just a one or two day relationship

1586
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,200
So heat waves are basically not too serious a problem

1587
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,000
in Taiwan

1588
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,880
And the really serious problem is that we

1589
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,600
The results of a study done in 2009

1590
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,840
as far back as almost 10 years ago

1591
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,360
we noticed this

1592
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:42,000
in Taiwan

1593
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,960
all of taiwan

1594
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,640
Here is an article from our 2002

1595
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,600
He just said that his information will be pushed back

1596
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,240
This is all the rainfall in Taiwan

1597
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,200
Average rainfall throughout the year

1598
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,160
This line is an average of 2 3 1 5mm

1599
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,840
up and down

1600
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,400
But there is no long-term change

1601
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,200
The second graph is the number of hours we have rain

1602
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,040
it goes up and down

1603
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,840
But it has a long-term change

1604
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:29,440
Total rainfall is derived from rainfall hours

1605
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,920
that's the intensity of the rain

1606
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,360
did you notice

1607
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,280
When the rainfall intensity reached almost 80 years

1608
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,720
all of a sudden increase

1609
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,400
increase

1610
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,680
just increased

1611
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,080
to a similar extent

1612
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,720
The average is almost 3 2.9

1613
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,920
Then this has increased by almost 1

1614
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,920
That is an increase of 30%

1615
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,080
rainfall intensity

1616
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,320
increased by 30%

1617
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,920
That's another point of view

1618
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,040
I just explained this to you

1619
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,800
say every 10 years on average

1620
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,600
heavy rain here

1621
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,200
It's raining here

1622
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,880
it has this tendency

1623
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:08,920
Increase in heavy rainfall

1624
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,080
Moderate rain decreases

1625
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,680
The whole world has seen this

1626
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,720
We analyze the data of the United States

1627
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,720
Also heavy rainfall is increasing

1628
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:18,480
Moderate rain hasn't changed much

1629
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,480
This America is a comparison

1630
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,480
interesting example

1631
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,840
is total rainfall in the United States is increasing

1632
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,040
This is different from Taiwan

1633
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,400
Our total rainfall in Taiwan

1634
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,400
very little change

1635
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,760
But America North America

1636
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,600
Total rainfall is increasing

1637
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,040
The result of this is

1638
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,040
Its heavy rainfall increases even more

1639
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,040
not just

1640
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,160
I mean the whole world has seen it

1641
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,640
Increase in heavy rainfall

1642
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,640
Moderate rain decreases

1643
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,200
this in theory

1644
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:57,200
now more and more mature

1645
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,200
Year 2003

1646
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,200
spring bass

1647
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
they published an article

1648
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,200
put the past almost ten years

1649
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:13,800
A comparative summary of theoretical articles in this area

1650
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,800
conclude

1651
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,900
It is basically now that the theory is getting more and more mature

1652
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:23,800
It's just that its quantification is still not very certain

1653
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,800
it basically says

1654
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,600
According to the most basic principles of physics

1655
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,600
Just increase the temperature by one degree

1656
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:41,600
Because most of the earth's surface is water

1657
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,100
water vapor on the sea

1658
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:48,600
temperature increased by one degree

1659
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,100
water vapor on the sea

1660
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,600
will increase by about seven Percent

1661
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,400
said

1662
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,600
You added 7% more water vapor

1663
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,800
if nothing else remains the same

1664
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,200
Each rainfall should increase by 7%

1665
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:13,200
But heavy rainfall will increase even more

1666
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,200
why

1667
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:21,600
Because 7% entered heavy rainfall

1668
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,600
Because heavy rainfall is usually a very large convective system

1669
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,200
The convection system sucks in from the bottom

1670
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:34,200
lots of air down there

1671
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,200
its watery air

1672
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,800
So this water vapor has increased by 7%

1673
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,600
Once it enters the convection

1674
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,200
when it goes up

1675
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,600
It was water vapor when it went up

1676
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,000
will become

1677
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,000
go up and get cold

1678
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:54,600
Turns into liquid water when cooled

1679
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,800
From water vapor to liquid water

1680
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,000
it gives off what's called latent heat

1681
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Liquid water turns to ice

1682
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
continue to emit shallow heat

1683
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Emitting shallow heat is for the study of meteorology

1684
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
They think that making the convection more intense

1685
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,000
In other words, you originally only increased by 7%

1686
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
But your convection is stronger

1687
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
That is to say, heavy rainfall

1688
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
The increase will be much more than 7%

1689
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,000
For this I used schematic

1690
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
That is to say, water vapor enters

1691
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
It emits a shallow heat after entering

1692
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Then make the convective system more intense

1693
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
This is our estimate

1694
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
right to estimate

1695
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
No, we were meant to do global

1696
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
This is what we did for Taiwan

1697
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,700
Estimated using data from Taiwan

1698
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,000
What is this estimate?

1699
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
That is, when the global temperature increases by one degree

1700
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,500
How will Taiwan's rainfall intensity change?

1701
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,000
then i just said

1702
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Let's just divide Taiwan's annual rainfall into

1703
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
According to its rainfall intensity, it is divided into ten equal parts

1704
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Then we calculate the result that

1705
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
The strongest ten percent of heavy rainfall

1706
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Just one degree increase in global temperature

1707
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
It increased by almost 140%

1708
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
almost doubled and a half

1709
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Just one degree increase in global temperature increases

1710
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
only heavy rainfall

1711
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Thousands of ten percent heavy rainfall doubles and a half

1712
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
The light rain is decreasing

1713
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
are decreasing

1714
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
the impact of this

1715
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
of course that means

1716
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I think everyone can imagine

1717
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
that

1718
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,200
I was introducing this just now

1719
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,200
Just say the old one

1720
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,800
It was mentioned in ancient civilizations

1721
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,600
This heavy rainfall increases

1722
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,800
This will increase flooding

1723
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,600
ok

1724
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,400
Then the top 10% is supposed to increase so much

1725
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,800
then you can imagine

1726
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,400
We actually count the top 1%

1727
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,600
Top 1% increase over 220%

1728
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,800
we know this

1729
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,000
We counted the top 1%

1730
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
the more intense kind of rain

1731
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,400
10% stronger than 1% ahead

1732
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,000
Almost all the heavy rainfall brought by the typhoon

1733
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,400
The top 1% more than tripled

1734
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,400
so this

1735
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,800
global temperature increase

1736
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:52,100
Increased chance of landslides and floods

1737
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,900
will be very large

1738
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,300
more than double more than double

1739
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,400
the reduction of the light rain

1740
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,100
For example, in this

1741
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,280
winter and spring

1742
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,720
The rain in Taiwan is almost all light rain

1743
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,560
After you reduce the light rain

1744
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:10,520
There will be problems with spring plowing in the second spring

1745
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:15,320
If you take a closer look at Taiwan's spring situation

1746
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:19,320
Spring plowing to do a simple statistics

1747
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:22,600
It can be noticed that the plowing rate of spring plowing in recent years

1748
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:26,000
Much higher than 50 years ago

1749
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Here I will give you a rough estimate.

1750
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,760
1950 to 2005

1751
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,360
global temperature increase

1752
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,640
almost very close to 0.7 degrees

1753
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:45,040
0.7% of each degree of Taiwan 140%

1754
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,800
almost 100%

1755
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,680
That is to say

1756
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,480
You said it was this heavy rain that gave you

1757
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,960
brought the words of the flood

1758
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:00,160
basically the basis of this flood

1759
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,500
double the odds

1760
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:02,500
OK

1761
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,500
The light rain has also decreased relatively.

1762
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,500
Then follow this effect

1763
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,500
certainly

1764
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,500
this is what we have seen

1765
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,000
what has happened

1766
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Taiwan has

1767
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,500
that in addition

1768
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,000
The IPCC

1769
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,500
It is estimated that by 2035

1770
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,000
will increase by about 0.7 degrees

1771
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
that is to say

1772
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,500
what we just said

1773
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,000
turn it over again

1774
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
OK

1775
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So to this 2035

1776
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Taiwan's flood control

1777
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Anti-landslide

1778
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,500
anti-sweat measures

1779
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,000
should be

1780
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
in the 1950's

1781
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
or earlier

1782
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
These engineering facilities

1783
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
should be tripled

1784
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
increase by 3 times

1785
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
sounds like it says yes

1786
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
we're going to take this

1787
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,260
Project tripled

1788
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,560
I did ask people

1789
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:04,960
People say Tamsui River

1790
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,960
The entire Tamsui River Basin in Greater Taipei

1791
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,040
Increase this flood control project

1792
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,100
don't say three times

1793
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,560
even if you double

1794
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:16,760
do it again

1795
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,160
He said do it again

1796
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,840
how much do you want

1797
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,560
He said to use photos to count

1798
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,400
that is

1799
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,600
so this

1800
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,160
Questions like this

1801
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,460
ah british

1802
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:33,660
Because special attention has been paid to this aspect of climate change

1803
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:37,160
they often come to my office

1804
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,460
to talk about this

1805
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,960
He said ah he said this is in our UK

1806
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,260
There is also this phenomenon

1807
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,160
I said we I told others

1808
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,560
This is what we need for flood control

1809
01:24:47,060 --> 01:24:49,060
to find a way

1810
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:49,760
make him

1811
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:54,360
This flood protection measure re-enlarges it

1812
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,660
He said

1813
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,260
I'm in the UK

1814
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:58,460
we also say

1815
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,060
What a lot of engineering needs to be added

1816
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
But the government never

1817
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
he said why not

1818
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
He said it makes sense

1819
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Think about it

1820
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
he does this project

1821
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
wait till it's done

1822
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
timing

1823
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Don't talk about four-year term

1824
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
He served eight years

1825
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
He can't even see when it's done

1826
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
He said there wasn't even a single vote

1827
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
He said why to do it

1828
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
so they don't do it

1829
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
so he suggested we

1830
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
later in Taiwan

1831
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
set up a

1832
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
a complete

1833
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
independent

1834
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
completely independent

1835
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
How to say

1836
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
to global warming

1837
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Oversight Team

1838
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:46,000
like

1839
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Great Britain was formed

1840
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
i miss us taiwan

1841
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
will not be established

1842
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
basic solution

1843
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
that

1844
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
of course we know

1845
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
The basic solution is to prevent

1846
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
the mitigation

1847
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Of course, stopping global warming can reduce carbon

1848
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
easier said than done

1849
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
show everyone

1850
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
current carbon dioxide emissions

1851
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Still keep going up, all over the world

1852
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Taiwan is not left behind

1853
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I think I showed you this last time

1854
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
After 1980 to 2005

1855
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
The grayest is our Taiwan

1856
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Take a break from the American people to increase

1857
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
More than 12 metric tons increased by 3 times

1858
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
The three worst countries in the world

1859
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
we are now second only to them

1860
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
USA Australia and Canada

1861
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Of course there are some very small countries in the middle

1862
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
here is only count

1863
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
A country with a population of more than 10 million

1864
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
we are number four

1865
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,600
All Western European countries and Japan are under us

1866
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,440
not to mention france

1867
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,960
France is this one

1868
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,120
OK

1869
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,520
china is here

1870
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,360
China is now more than five

1871
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,760
It's over five now

1872
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,920
What are the main differences between France and Taiwan?

1873
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,120
Does anyone know

1874
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:27,120
nuclear power

1875
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:27,720
nuclear power

1876
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,840
Nuclear Power Now Sounds Dirty World

1877
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:33,480
but

1878
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,960
This is mainly

1879
01:27:37,240 --> 01:27:39,960
France is different from us

1880
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:46,040
Of course we're going to take us from 12 metric tons

1881
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,640
reduced to 4 metric tons

1882
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,800
Because the target is 4 metric tons

1883
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,240
we are now

1884
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,320
Actually we may be over 12 metric tons

1885
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,960
to reduce to 4 metric tons

1886
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,440
our estimate

1887
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,480
Saving and improving efficiency may be almost 65% from 12-4

1888
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:13,600
20% of them may be saved and improved efficiency can be achieved

1889
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,000
Here I specifically mentioned putting in a vegetarian

1890
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,200
Vegetarianism is actually a very effective way

1891
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:25,200
But it's easier said than done

1892
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:30,600
I'm basically a vegetarian for two days a week

1893
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,800
I'm not bad at other times

1894
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:43,800
Vegetarianism is not only that it can save a lot of greenhouse gases

1895
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:48,800
It's on top of the greenhouse gases we're putting in right now

1896
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,000
it is slow to come out

1897
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
It will basically take 100 years to come out

1898
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
100 years after we put it in now, it will still be heated for at least 50 years

1899
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,160
Still at home a hundred years later

1900
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,440
Most of it will come out in a hundred years

1901
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,480
But if you say vegetarian

1902
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,880
very powerful

1903
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,920
vegetarian words

1904
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,680
If you say that many people are vegetarian

1905
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,960
That's a lot of them now dedicated to raising cattle and sheep.

1906
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,960
Like Brazil he burned many souls

1907
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,120
It's all about raising cattle and sheep

1908
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,440
then sell

1909
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,160
European places such as the United States and the United Kingdom

1910
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,960
A lot of farmland it can return to life

1911
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,280
Because vegetarians need very little food

1912
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,400
a lot less

1913
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,800
If there is not so much food

1914
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,880
A lot of land can be released

1915
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,440
back to life

1916
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,560
back to life

1917
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,800
It sucks carbon dioxide directly from the air

1918
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:47,520
down

1919
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,960
food very fast

1920
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,800
several years

1921
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,320
can be done in a few years

1922
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,520
If you don't believe me, it's true that none of us are vegetarians.

1923
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,800
and say vegetarian

1924
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,240
In fact, I am also quite excited

1925
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,840
Because every time I say vegetarian

1926
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,360
People always say oops best man ever

1927
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:05,560
I also think it's hard to eat meat, but it tastes better

1928
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,960
But what?

1929
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:09,960
But do you know that when I was in college

1930
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,360
i have already said

1931
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,840
everyone is younger than me

1932
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,360
I didn't expect to go to college

1933
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,120
I am Taichung No.1 Middle School

1934
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,720
Treasure to send big

1935
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,400
OK

1936
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:21,960
Chengda has only three restaurants

1937
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,840
There are only three restaurants for boys

1938
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:26,200
a girl restaurant

1939
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,760
our boys restaurant

1940
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:31,000
Everyone loves that third restaurant

1941
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,760
It is better than modern

1942
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,640
Things to eat

1943
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,840
we run every time

1944
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,840
run to everyone

1945
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,840
we were

1946
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,120
I'm basically never full

1947
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,480
I'm never full for breakfast

1948
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,720
That

1949
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:46,520
at that time

1950
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,440
I was in Chengda for four years

1951
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,600
that

1952
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,200
that rice bag

1953
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,360
The price of the package meal has never changed

1954
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,080
That

1955
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:58,720
guess how much a month

1956
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
how much?

1957
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,000
150

1958
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,000
150

1959
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
any left?

1960
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
90

1961
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Some people say 90

1962
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Wow

1963
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
If 90

1964
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I tell you

1965
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I'm not here today

1966
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Then

1967
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
that

1968
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I was

1969
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
this is really

1970
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It's the wind that blows

1971
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
i feel a little bit

1972
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
thin feeling

1973
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
at that time i

1974
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Often less than 60 kg

1975
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I now

1976
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
75 kg

1977
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
How much difference do you see

1978
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I'm not so fat now

1979
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
It was good at that time

1980
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
we had breakfast

1981
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
180

1982
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
90 is really

1983
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
180

1984
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
a month

1985
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Think about it 180 a month

1986
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
one day

1987
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
How many

1988
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
6 pieces

1989
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
A meal is only 2 yuan

1990
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
At that time, breakfast was less than two yuan

1991
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I guess for breakfast I'm afraid he put a dollar in it

1992
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:11,000
The porridge we ate for breakfast

1993
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
pick that up

1994
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
You can't eat two bowls

1995
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
ok then you say run faster

1996
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
In the morning, I ran to fish the bottom

1997
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
This water will know me too

1998
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
but that cook is smarter than you

1999
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
they are not less

2000
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
He cooked the porridge

2001
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Let’s just say the rice grains and the water

2002
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
no matter what height you put

2003
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
it weighs the same

2004
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
It's the same wherever you dig

2005
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
just like rivers and lakes

2006
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So you eat, some people say why don’t you eat steamed buns

2007
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I want to say when I hear this

2008
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
I said oops there's a king in France

2009
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
The lady said the sign up was hungry

2010
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
no bread

2011
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
He said how could these idiots not eat

2012
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,280
do you want cake

2013
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,240
That no no no no steamed buns

2014
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,960
it's like saying

2015
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,440
It's not good for you to eat porridge

2016
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,960
Are you going to eat steamed buns?

2017
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:13,240
If there were steamed buns, I would not weigh 60 kg

2018
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:15,240
I mean

2019
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,800
I used to eat very little meat

2020
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,640
It's actually healthy

2021
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:22,040
Just give us some steamed buns in the morning

2022
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:26,040
That should actually be passable

2023
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,160
That also means

2024
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:31,520
That means we eat meat in Taiwan now

2025
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,280
When do you think we eat meat

2026
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,720
Actually very recently

2027
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,360
I'm afraid it will be 20 or 30 years.

2028
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:40,240
even americans

2029
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:45,440
The American who first started eating meat

2030
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,960
Guess when

2031
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:48,960
after World War II

2032
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,240
They just started eating meat

2033
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,400
before World War II

2034
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,280
they didn't eat the meat

2035
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,440
the best proof is

2036
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,960
1928 call for presidential campaign pioneer

2037
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,680
He said you choose my words

2038
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,280
he said i promise

2039
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,480
a chicken in every part

2040
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,080
ah yes

2041
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:13,040
Chicken is the cheapest meat in America

2042
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:13,840
chicken

2043
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,640
He said you just choose me

2044
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:16,880
i promise you go home

2045
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,480
Every night there is a chicken in that pot

2046
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:22,800
he chose

2047
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:26,120
So what does this represent?

2048
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,680
Let's say in 1928 most people in the United States

2049
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,640
no chicken for dinner

2050
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,440
because if there is chicken to eat

2051
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,480
why choose it

2052
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,840
so that

2053
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,080
Then I didn't have to eat for 28 years

2054
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,800
as you can imagine

2055
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,040
later in the 1930s

2056
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:44,200
Needless to say

2057
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,880
America in the 1930s

2058
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,960
the Great Panic

2059
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:48,800
it's over

2060
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:49,720
then fight

2061
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,360
Not to mention what kind of meat to eat when fighting a war

2062
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,840
so basically

2063
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,920
The United States probably didn't eat meat until the 1950s

2064
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,800
Europe is nothing compared to the 60s

2065
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Nothing like the 70s, our 80s

2066
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,400
Mainland China in the 1990s OK

2067
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:10,000
so we eat meat is very recent

2068
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:13,600
We were generally not meat-eating animals in the past

2069
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,200
Eating so much meat is actually bad for your health

2070
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,800
So here's a chance to spread the word

2071
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,600
Naf carbon energy

2072
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,600
Of course this is not possible

2073
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,000
I guess vegetarians can't do it

2074
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
So always look for non-carbon energy

2075
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,200
Take a look at non-carbon energy

2076
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,400
Solar energy is of course endless

2077
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,000
but expensive

2078
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,700
If we all use solar energy

2079
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,800
Basically everyone does nothing

2080
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,200
just buy solar

2081
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:49,400
So water power wind power sea

2082
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,100
This sounds good

2083
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:55,400
Right now, let's actually do it

2084
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,100
we want to add

2085
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,800
Taiwan's water power is good

2086
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:59,900
But it's all used up now

2087
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,960
but about 2% to 3%

2088
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,360
that's pretty good too

2089
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:07,680
Reproductive power can indeed be a lot

2090
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:11,120
But this reproductive energy is the same as food

2091
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:13,680
it you use a lot of food to grow

2092
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,360
reproductive energy words

2093
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,520
This whole food is going to get really expensive

2094
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,920
So it's not very feasible

2095
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:25,880
what's left

2096
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:31,200
After the earthquake in Japan, no one dared to say how

2097
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,840
so i don't say anything

2098
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,880
That is to say, there is no solution

2099
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,120
OK, this is actually unsolvable at the moment

2100
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,360
I don't even remember this

2101
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,720
there's a geoengineering we're almost done with

2102
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,400
You can come back after taking a nap

2103
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:55,360
That geoengineering is a pretty interesting thing

2104
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,960
Geoengineering has been talked about recently

2105
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,760
In fact, we have been talking about it for twenty or thirty years.

2106
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,800
the simplest and most feasible

2107
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,080
The first one is afforestation

2108
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,960
But afforestation is impossible without trees

2109
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,200
currently limited area

2110
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:16,720
But if you have a solid word

2111
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:21,280
Afforestation is a pretty good way

2112
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:28,120
Everything else has it's very serious problems

2113
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,480
But now everyone knows

2114
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,520
we do air pollution

2115
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:39,680
do the environment do the climate

2116
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,560
We all know that the stratosphere adds some pollutants

2117
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,000
add some lurking power

2118
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,920
like a volcano

2119
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,600
It is currently very feasible

2120
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,480
what's the only bad thing about it

2121
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:54,520
It is tantamount to putting a pollutant

2122
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:59,880
Into a stratosphere to fight

2123
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
another artificial this this

2124
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
carbon dioxide

2125
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Well

2126
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
That is to say, from this direction

2127
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
he is he is a comparison to everyone

2128
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
something you don't want to accept

2129
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
but i'm guessing

2130
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
ah

2131
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,000
If say another ten or twenty years, the real problem

2132
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
big

2133
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
like this

2134
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Well

2135
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
that that that

2136
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,000
The problem of extreme weather becomes very big if

2137
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Well

2138
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
there will be a united nations may

2139
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
authorized

2140
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
do some experiments on this

2141
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Because of this experiment

2142
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
nature has

2143
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Experiments that have been given to us

2144
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
and the experiment is valid

2145
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and his

2146
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
It has very little side effects

2147
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
what is that

2148
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It's a volcano

2149
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
most everyone remembers

2150
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Should be the one from the Philippines

2151
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
year 1991

2152
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Volcanoes in Pingan Tubu

2153
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
After that eruption, there are many things

2154
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
its explosive

2155
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Enter the safe layer

2156
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
In 1992, 1993

2157
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
global temperature

2158
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
It has dropped by about 0.2 to 0.3 degrees

2159
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
two full years

2160
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
0.2 0.3 degrees down

2161
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
you see a small volcano

2162
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Drop 0.2 0.3 degrees

2163
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
The world has only increased by 0.6 degrees in 100 years

2164
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
so you just do

2165
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
make three small volcanoes

2166
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,000
the whole 100 years

2167
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
can get it back

2168
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So it seems to work

2169
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
just say now

2170
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
you use a big plane

2171
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
or a big rocket

2172
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
send this

2173
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
even with big balloons

2174
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Sending Pollutants to Stratosphere

2175
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
not very difficult

2176
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
this is promising

2177
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
So don't think it's hopeless

2178
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
But

2179
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
even if there is hope

2180
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I guess until the United Nations

2181
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
when approved

2182
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
I'm afraid it will be decades later

2183
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
within these decades

2184
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
We in Taiwan should do debugging

2185
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
That is to say, for such extreme weather

2186
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
this flood drought

2187
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
our government

2188
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:24,000
The real thing to say is that you should swim up and down

2189
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
our government in this regard

2190
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Measures against floods and droughts

2191
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
really need to work hard

2192
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I think this is quite important

2193
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
At this time, I also want to talk a little bit

2194
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Our Research on Extreme Weather

2195
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
currently in this

2196
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,000
There are still many places that do not fully agree

2197
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Some people think that the result of what we do

2198
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
maybe a little too big

2199
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Because IBCC says

2200
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
The result obtained is relatively small

2201
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,200
Small quite a lot

2202
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:02,200
10 times smaller

2203
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:08,400
So IBCC itself is now Evaluating this problem

2204
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,200
they are not quite

2205
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:14,200
did not fully accept our view

2206
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:17,200
That is, the global temperature increases by one degree

2207
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:21,800
This strong drop will also increase a lot

2208
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,800
Especially where the tail is low

2209
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,300
But I think this information

2210
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:29,400
more and more complete

2211
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,700
The model will get better and better in the future

2212
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:40,200
We should have a more affirmative answer to this question from time to time.

2213
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:43,100
took everyone's time

2214
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:44,900
so thank you all

2215
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:45,600
ok

2216
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,600
Thanks

2217
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:51,200
Thank you Director Liu

2218
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:52,900
We still have ten minutes

2219
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,400
I don't know if there is any problem doing it

2220
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,400
to bring up for discussion

2221
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,400
A rare opportunity

2222
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,200
please

2223
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,400
Small quite a lot

2224
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:02,400
thank you all

2225
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,400
thank you all

2226
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,400
Small quite a lot

2227
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:05,400
Thanks

2228
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:06,400
Thanks

2229
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,400
Thanks

2230
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,400
Thanks

2231
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,500
Sorry teacher

2232
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:04,620
you just mentioned

2233
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:09,260
This is in the part that lowers greenhouse gases

2234
01:42:09,260 --> 01:42:11,700
parts of some so-called earth factories

2235
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:14,500
The first part mentions reforestation

2236
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,900
Well one thing we're curious about is

2237
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:19,240
why must feel

2238
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,680
What you just said is that

2239
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,700
There is an absolute relationship between tens and afforestation

2240
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,100
But the part like Taiwan

2241
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:26,700
There is a lot of farmland in the south-central

2242
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,300
Well, it's all presented now

2243
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:30,800
no situation

2244
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,840
Then why is the afforestation part not considered in

2245
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,300
part of flat land

2246
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:38,300
For example, choose some fast-growing bridge trees

2247
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,200
Then it is the substance itself to carry out photosynthesis

2248
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,400
It can consume a lot with the fixed open space

2249
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:44,500
carbon dioxide

2250
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:47,000
If only some of the high ornamental value

2251
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,300
And it is a fast-growing large bridge tree

2252
01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:51,500
it is not itself a

2253
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,200
Is it a good solution?

2254
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,600
Thanks

2255
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,300
what you said is absolutely correct

2256
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,900
not the only one you say

2257
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,460
something you didn't notice

2258
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:04,240
That is to say, you put these things in Taiwan

2259
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:07,040
It's all flat bottom to reforestation

2260
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,200
that's also very very small

2261
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,960
Taiwan is a small place after all

2262
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:14,000
So our afforestation

2263
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,560
The problem is the area

2264
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:17,400
The problem is area

2265
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,960
this is

2266
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,200
because you think about it

2267
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:24,040
A place like America

2268
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:29,460
You see how much it used to be covered by forest

2269
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,500
How much forest cover is there now

2270
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,700
that is far

2271
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:35,260
unless somewhere like that

2272
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,260
that big place

2273
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:38,420
Big places like America and China

2274
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,420
afforestation on a large scale

2275
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:43,020
You want such a large area of ​​afforestation

2276
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:46,020
food production must be

2277
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:51,560
pull it to the vegan stage

2278
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,000
there is hope

2279
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,660
Otherwise, your area will never be enough

2280
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:57,860
Taiwan you got it all

2281
01:43:57,860 --> 01:43:59,900
make a little

2282
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
ask Mr. Liu

2283
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,300
You use Taiwan's data to see the intensity of rainfall

2284
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:09,200
The relationship between temperature change and rainfall

2285
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:11,000
Do you also do global

2286
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Global results are similar

2287
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Yes

2288
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
our global results

2289
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I remember the global result being slightly smaller than this

2290
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
No more than about 110 to 120

2291
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:31,000
In fact, it is like saying that we do lower-dimensional

2292
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:34,000
better than Taiwan

2293
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Excuse me, what did you just say about geoengineering?

2294
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Stratosphere plus some micro-arc melody thing

2295
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Ask him if there is any risk

2296
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Since you said he is currently more viable

2297
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Why does the United Nations have to take some time to do something like this

2298
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Many people have thought about the side effects

2299
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
i mean emphatically

2300
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,500
nature is already doing

2301
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:03,320
you don't care if we do or not

2302
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:04,560
nature is already doing

2303
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,960
The best ever

2304
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:12,240
Actually is an interesting question

2305
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,800
that is to say around

2306
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:19,560
about 700,000 years ago

2307
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:21,960
That so-called one called

2308
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,680
Poba TOBA

2309
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:28,200
Poba this Indonesian one

2310
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:33,640
A volcanic eruption in Indonesia

2311
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:37,640
What is that volcanic eruption claimed to be?

2312
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,760
It's what we've heard about volcanic eruptions anyway.

2313
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:46,200
A hundred times that big volcano

2314
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:48,400
that big volcano erupted

2315
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:51,320
It is said that an earth

2316
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,520
That creature would be that extinct one

2317
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:55,720
very big one

2318
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
701

2319
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,420
I speak

2320
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:07,540
No

2321
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:10,980
70 super

2322
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:11,780
to 700,000 years

2323
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,620
700,000 years ago

2324
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:12,740
to 700,000 years ago

2325
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,040
70 less

2326
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:19,420
Yes do 70나

2327
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:24,360
like that big volcano

2328
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:26,860
after it explodes

2329
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:28,860
It's been cold for a long time

2330
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:32,360
Basically food production will have problems

2331
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,860
there are also people

2332
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:37,860
the Big Bang 700,000 years ago

2333
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:39,360
that did happen

2334
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,360
that big bang is thought to be

2335
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:42,860
Humanity

2336
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,360
Just now from that Russi

2337
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:47,360
3 million years to now

2338
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,860
say human

2339
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:53,860
There was barely a volcanic eruption 700,000 years ago

2340
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:54,860
Vipassana

2341
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:56,860
what we never said

2342
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:58,860
you and i are not here

2343
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,840
It is said that there is a theory that talks about people.

2344
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,200
that is paired

2345
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:12,600
Because of your pairing, you can give birth

2346
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:17,800
The effective pairing minimum for pairing is reduced to almost

2347
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:21,200
The worst is the worst estimate

2348
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:24,000
There are only a thousand pairs left

2349
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,400
so our genes

2350
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,400
Claiming to be our genes until now

2351
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,600
The one with only a thousand pairs

2352
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,600
Actually very outspoken

2353
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:33,600
people are a bit outspoken

2354
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:35,000
our gene

2355
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,800
Not too wide

2356
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,200
that

2357
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,000
so the volcano erupted

2358
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,600
the effects it causes

2359
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:45,800
ah

2360
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:47,500
as far as I can tell

2361
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:49,700
This small, medium-sized volcano

2362
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,500
we are pretty sure

2363
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:52,900
then we

2364
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:55,700
We use this artificial method

2365
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:58,200
put this pollutant in

2366
01:47:58,200 --> 01:47:59,800
we can

2367
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
put where we want

2368
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
and again we want

2369
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
put it at the time you want to do it

2370
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
and to the stratosphere

2371
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
as soon as we stop

2372
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
stratosphere back to troposphere

2373
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
We've all figured this out

2374
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
is only two years

2375
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
That is to say, if you do something wrong

2376
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
just two years

2377
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
like the one in the philippines

2378
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
after entering

2379
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
two-year effect

2380
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Very small by the third year

2381
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
not in the future

2382
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
so this

2383
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,000
i'm guessing

2384
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
By the time

2385
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
everyone is

2386
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
lazy

2387
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
That is to say, take the simplest method

2388
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
to solve

2389
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Teacher, what you just said

2390
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
a hundred years

2391
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
drop in temperature

2392
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
raise zero point six degrees

2393
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Then ask this 0.6 degrees

2394
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Let's say we start from

2395
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
alpine

2396
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
When descending from high altitude to low altitude

2397
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
that temperature will naturally decrease

2398
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
For example, from the Central Plains Institute

2399
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,940
Going out to the city hall 101 may increase the temperature by several degrees

2400
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:08,740
So how is this 0.6 degree calculated?

2401
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:11,340
That is to say, the 0.6 degree you mentioned is one

2402
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:15,300
what kind of thing

2403
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:16,340
The second is to say

2404
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:22,140
The temperature decreases by one degree for every 100 meters increase in altitude

2405
01:49:22,940 --> 01:49:25,640
So are we this Global warming?

2406
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:27,300
Why use degrees to express

2407
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:28,900
what does this mean

2408
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:29,600
that is

2409
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,000
Will humans evolve as the temperature rises?

2410
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,400
Maybe we can live with 40 degrees by then

2411
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,200
If you can't stand it, you'll hang up

2412
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:42,200
So I have been thinking about this plus or minus two degrees C

2413
01:49:42,200 --> 01:49:44,840
Could it be an ad for a politician

2414
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:46,400
If for an ecologist

2415
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:47,440
it represents a

2416
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,240
What is the degree of coming and going?

2417
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,140
i want to ask

2418
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,700
answer your questions

2419
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:55,700
this degree

2420
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,400
that is

2421
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,940
the two of us

2422
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,520
There has to be a measure for these things

2423
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:08,320
Do you think why Qin Shihuang wanted to unify these things?

2424
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,200
he has

2425
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,960
He is hoping to get something

2426
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,400
something we can all accept

2427
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:16,200
to do this unit

2428
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:18,320
So why do you say degrees

2429
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:22,680
This means that everyone is like European and American countries

2430
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:25,880
In fact, they have always been reluctant to use this degree

2431
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,800
He used that Fahrenheit

2432
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,560
He said to use that degree of Fahrenheit

2433
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,640
So he doesn't use our speed

2434
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:40,160
So it's just all together

2435
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:43,600
A unit that can communicate with each other

2436
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:45,960
not nothing great

2437
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:49,040
How much does the global temperature increase

2438
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:52,840
that it is cool in different parts of the world

2439
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,120
After it cools down, go to the average

2440
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:57,040
not like what you said

2441
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,880
It's colder here

2442
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
It is actually fixed

2443
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Do it all over the world

2444
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Tens of thousands of observations

2445
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
So 0.5 degrees is a big number

2446
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
that number global temperature

2447
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
It's not easy for you to get 0.5 degrees like this

2448
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
There was a French scholar named De Rijin

2449
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
i forgot his french way

2450
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
He is a hundred years old

2451
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Also stayed in China for a while De Rijin

2452
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I remember he came up with a theory

2453
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
He said the earth is slowly cooling

2454
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Is this the exact opposite?

2455
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Many people have mentioned this

2456
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Of course the most famous person

2457
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
His name is Milankovic

2458
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,000
He's a Sirvia man

2459
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Sirvia is now called the year before

2460
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
a place in yugoslavia

2461
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
it was in 1943

2462
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
1920 during the war I remember

2463
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
In 1943 a

2464
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
that is to say globally

2465
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Global temperature of ice and air versus flying ice and

2466
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
The theory of temperature change with ice and air

2467
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That is to say, the orbit of the sun and the earth

2468
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
some regular changes

2469
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Make the earth ice and air once every 100,000 years

2470
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
After it put forward this theory

2471
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
It was raised in 1943 until it died

2472
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
It is the object of cancellation

2473
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
People say it's unlikely to be true

2474
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
it says so

2475
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,680
Speaking of theory, it is quite complicated.

2476
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:07,720
Now of course it doesn't look that complicated

2477
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:14,720
But his theory lasted until 1978-80

2478
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:22,680
Get out the data of the sunken objects on the seabed

2479
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:25,360
Let's find out all the previous temperatures

2480
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:29,640
As a result, I found out the previous temperature and put it together with his temperature.

2481
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:31,960
almost identical

2482
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:36,360
So now everyone thinks he's great

2483
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,640
But he's been dead for a long time

2484
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:44,400
Your question was never answered

2485
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:49,960
That is to say, the glacier

2486
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,600
it cools down very slowly

2487
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:54,200
It will take almost 10 years for the temperature to drop

2488
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:55,640
but it heats up

2489
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:56,800
not 10 years

2490
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,200
That is to say, it takes 100,000 years for the temperature to cool down.

2491
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,420
It only takes 10,000 years to heat up

2492
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:04,340
We are now in Jianbingheqi

2493
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:05,960
Between the two soldiers and the flag

2494
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,320
some people think

2495
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:12,040
The time when we were soldiers and flags

2496
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:15,920
It's been almost 13,000 years

2497
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,420
13000 years is quite a long time

2498
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:23,760
Should go back to the next pawn and flag

2499
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:24,920
some people think so

2500
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:27,920
But most people think

2501
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,920
Our next soldier and flag are still far away

2502
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,420
still far

2503
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:35,420
Looks like at least 10,000 years

2504
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:37,920
so

2505
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,920
i think there's every question

2506
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,920
Teacher Liu, I would like to ask

2507
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:51,580
Mitigation and adaptation are two different concepts

2508
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:52,780
But between the two

2509
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:55,080
actually related

2510
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:58,500
Recently, I noticed some related news reports

2511
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,000
especially france

2512
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,840
Reduced cooling water capacity due to heat wave

2513
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:07,440
Then follow this operating specification

2514
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:08,840
it's running down load

2515
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:12,440
In the end, the lack of electricity has to import electricity from the UK

2516
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:14,040
that means say

2517
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,560
when

2518
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,720
good slowing tool

2519
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:19,280
such as nuclear energy

2520
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:23,000
Hypothetically, this natural disaster or climate change factor

2521
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
it might have a big discount on it

2522
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,600
reduce its ability to slow down

2523
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:32,920
Then I think more about the incident in Japan's Hudao Island.

2524
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:34,200
Even

2525
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:35,400
Everyone is more impressed

2526
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:38,040
Of course Hu Dao is not necessarily related to climate change

2527
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:41,040
but at least it's a natural disaster

2528
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:44,280
That is to say, nuclear energy is a very good mitigation tool

2529
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:46,560
But under natural disaster

2530
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,400
it becomes a question mark

2531
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,400
Can it be used as a long-term view

2532
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:54,760
Can it be used as a mitigation tool

2533
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:56,320
This is the first one

2534
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,920
First

2535
01:55:58,040 --> 01:55:59,280
first issue

2536
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,080
from here

2537
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,880
I want to derive the real thing I want to ask is

2538
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:05,000
For Taiwan

2539
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,200
Because I saw some reports recently

2540
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:10,500
That is to say, according to the assessment of the world risk company

2541
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:14,500
Taiwan is actually a high-risk area

2542
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:19,500
He said that it seems to include the number of three disasters

2543
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:21,500
Seems like a 76 chance

2544
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:25,500
There is probably such an assessment

2545
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,900
Let's assume that back to the first premise I mentioned just now

2546
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:32,400
Suppose so what I want to ask is to say

2547
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:36,900
For Taiwan from the perspective of climate change or natural disasters

2548
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:39,900
Taiwan compared to the world average

2549
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:42,900
Is it really a high-risk area?

2550
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,400
If so

2551
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:47,900
In contrast to what Professor Liu mentioned just now

2552
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:49,900
we are in mitigation

2553
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:51,900
From 4kg to 12

2554
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:55,900
In fact, it is disadvantageous in this respect

2555
01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:58,900
Then suppose we add this

2556
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:00,900
From the perspective of disaster

2557
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
that's even worse

2558
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
So what I really want to ask is to say

2559
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
The region of Taiwan compared to the world average

2560
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
From the perspective of climate change or natural disasters

2561
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Is it really as assessed by the risk company?

2562
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
is a high risk area

2563
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Thanks

2564
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
good question

2565
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
But your question

2566
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
basically i think what you said

2567
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
that's true as far as i know

2568
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
It's actually quite easy to answer

2569
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Think about how big our Taiwan is

2570
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Four typhoons come every year

2571
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Almost all four typhoons will bring good rain

2572
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
So the probability of a flood is

2573
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,000
It is deadly high compared to many countries

2574
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Especially for the entire Pacific Ocean

2575
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:00,000
This type of typhoon is stronger than the Atlantic typhoon

2576
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
average is strong

2577
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
So we in Taiwan are rushing again

2578
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
The typhoon is coming towards us

2579
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Of course there is always someone worse than us

2580
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,000
In terms of typhoon, you go to the Philippines

2581
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
that's really what you do every year

2582
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Soak in water all day long

2583
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,000
we died hundreds of people

2584
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,000
we feel very unacceptable

2585
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,000
You go to see the people who die in typhoons every year in the Philippines

2586
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
If he can reach less than a hundred people

2587
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
he's overjoyed

2588
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,000
So the typhoon is actually very powerful

2589
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,000
But the Philippines has fewer earthquakes than us

2590
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,000
So Taiwan has many earthquakes and typhoons

2591
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
what more

2592
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
For our population, it is more worrying

2593
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Then our Han disaster is stronger

2594
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:10,040
Everyone thinks that 2500 mm of water is a lot of water for us a year

2595
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:13,200
2500 mm lot of water

2596
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:15,340
But because of the large population

2597
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:18,840
Average water resources per person

2598
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:22,040
In fact, Taiwan ranks far behind in the world.

2599
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:26,080
further back than mainland China as we know it

2600
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:28,980
Mainland China seems to be shared by everyone

2601
01:59:28,980 --> 01:59:30,680
twice as much as us

2602
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:34,480
So yes ours is a high risk zone

2603
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:38,880
plus this earthquake

2604
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,880
Make this nuclear energy no way to use in Taiwan

2605
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:49,180
It makes our action of slowing down in Taiwan even more

2606
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:51,180
looks very difficult

2607
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:52,280
very difficult

2608
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,180
well because the time is just right

2609
01:59:56,180 --> 01:59:58,580
we are very grateful for this today

2610
01:59:58,580 --> 02:00:00,680
Professor Liu Shaocheng is very strong

2611
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,520
I beg you 영 Athen Kaixing
