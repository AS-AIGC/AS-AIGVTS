00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,640
Log on, gem!

2
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,260
Let me present to you...

3
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,960
the famous RPC Sóng M alguien

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:45,520
from Hanyang in Pohbank

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,440
Episode 14

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,480
Please welcome Mr.P Hong Xœ bother ASL

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,320
Teacher, Academician Wang and all the guests

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,560
Colleagues in the hospital, good night everyone

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,320
It is a great pleasure to invite Professor Chen Zhuting today

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,200
Come give knowledge Try this speech

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,960
Professor Chen's Basic Experience

12
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,680
in the speech

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
But I can reveal a lot.

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,360
Because he and I are colleagues at National Taiwan University

15
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,920
20 years

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
his office is next door to mine

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
So I have worked with you for many years

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
he is very easy to recognize

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,160
when you speak

20
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,560
it's his hair

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,720
then very elegant

22
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,080
Then

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We are the Beethoven of chemistry

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can see her image is very similar to that photo of Beethoven

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
so you'll remember

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That Mr. Chen

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
National Taiwan University is mine

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He is my student in the chemistry department

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then after going abroad

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Go to Emerging Natti University

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And Ai Hehua

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ph.D. from State University

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then did a postdoc at Penn State

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Returned to National Taiwan University to teach in about 1985

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in teaching

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
very popular with students

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Research is also well done

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Received the Outstanding Research Award from the National Science Council

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In recent years very

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
This cares about the general education of the university

41
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,400
science education

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,240
so this

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,480
also did this

44
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,120
The director of the chemistry center of the entire Taiwan chemical community

45
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,040
And now this is National Taiwan University

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,640
Science Education Development Center

47
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,800
He put a small one outside

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,040
Panford

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,040
that

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,240
Science Education Development Center

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
he puts a lot of effort

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,480
that is now

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,840
Uh, for example, his Discovery series

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,200
Already the seventh installment of the Discovery series

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,520
This exploration series is very fun

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Uh, there are about six long and eight long in one semester.

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,440
weekend speech

58
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Music Institute at National Taiwan University

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,240
Music Institute of National Taiwan University

60
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
This weekend from two to four

61
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,440
something like this

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,720
then no credit

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,120
I don't care about the guests

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But the students participated enthusiastically

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's like there were 400 people last time

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
When the classroom is full, the outside is also full

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is what he promotes. This year is the seventh issue of the exploration series.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So you know he puts a lot of effort into

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
On the development of science education

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think he will have his own characteristics when he comes on stage

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
easily you will remember him later

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All Taiwanese high school teachers

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Everyone in Taiwan remembers him as a very special

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
unique style

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This year he will also talk about a very unique topic

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Energy and Sustainable Civilization

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We clap hands to welcome Professor Chen

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thanks

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you Vice President Peng

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is really unreasonable

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He does have an office next door to mine

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So I have been the care of Vice President Peng for so many years

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to this precious place today

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I really feel a little bit like selling articles in front of Confucius

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Especially vice president Peng will fly to Europe tonight

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I really feel a little unworthy

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Then he specially invited Academician Wang Yi over to say

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The following Q&A and the ending part should be annoyed to Academician Wang Yi

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So two good colleagues and good friends can come here today

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
let myself be a little pampered

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Of course, I rarely feel nervous when I give a speech.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I just mentioned it to Professor Tang Pingzhe

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So here's a lot of familiar faces I've seen

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Colleagues, good friends of Zhongyuan Institute

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hello everyone

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And good night, viewers

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thanks

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I actually struggled for a long time

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have been thinking about what kind of topic to use for this speech

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a feast of knowledge, I know we should talk about something more popular

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But if you want to enter Academia Sinica

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I always feel that it is better to have a little professionalism behind

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But I still chose this topic

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Express my recent concerns

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Some have gone beyond chemistry

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Although Ren Yuan still has a very close relationship with chemistry

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But in what I'm going to report today

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You can see that many but not all of the questions I asked were

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Especially most likely not chemistry problems

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If I continue, I will give lectures related to chemistry

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
maybe please include

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The other is that sustainable civilization is actually a question that is often raised by people nowadays.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Then I want to emphasize a little bit to everyone.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
After all, when a scientist looks at something like this

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you have any unique perspectives?

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The crisis for everyone is now whether domestic or foreign

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A question that everyone pays close attention to

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
but there is a problem in taiwan

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
As long as it is a very hot topic or problem

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then everyone will find a self-shooting answer to it.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then everyone is very familiar with this thing, we have all heard of it

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In fact, is everyone’s crisis really serious in Taiwan?

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I believe this question is not so easy to answer

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But let's see if you go to Crisis Encyclopedia to find the definition

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Everyone's crisis actually refers to when your personnel, especially in terms of economics, he emphasized

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
When you have difficulties in working needs

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He has bottleneck congestion

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,500
We already said he can use crisis

129
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I remember myself paying more attention to this noun

130
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
It happened to be when I first came to America

131
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
At that time, cars were also expensive, and gasoline was also expensive.

132
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Then all the graduate students suddenly couldn't find a job

133
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
So it's obviously not just this that Yong shot

134
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
ordinary economic problems

135
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,500
But what everyone feels more easily recently should be

136
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,500
In terms of interesting electricity prices, oil prices,

137
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Immediately it has been reflected that it will rise

138
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,000
For Taiwan, everyone has been arguing a lot lately

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you look at this table

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is an Exon XN in the US their oil company

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
A report given in 2004

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,500
This is the 2004 report

143
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
It is above the work area, the green area

144
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Already seen in 2004

145
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
that is to say they are

146
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,000
In terms of the output that can be provided

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Already in a downward trend

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,100
The world's demand is going up in reverse

150
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,140
This is 2004

151
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,420
you can tell

152
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,980
They think the difference between supply and demand

153
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,540
Already at least 4% to 6%

154
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,600
The gap above this

155
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,940
So far, 2012 is obviously in

156
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,020
Here you can see the gap increase

157
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,580
is multiplied several times

158
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,400
Indicates the current situation of personnel crisis

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,420
Compare

160
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,240
In the past few years, the difference is much more

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,620
So we use another table to look at the oil price and see that the oil price is actually what he just uploaded

162
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,400
oil price

163
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,480
This is a more professional way of saying we don't care about him

164
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,520
You can see it in this trend

165
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,860
This one is the most obvious and it was two years ago

166
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,640
economic tsunami

167
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,440
caused by

168
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,740
Oil prices per barrel break through

169
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,280
140

170
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,060
$140

171
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,040
That

172
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,340
Actually it's probably closer to 150

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So this signal is very obvious

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But what I am asking everyone to pay attention to now is not just this signal.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
but from 2003

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Until now about 2012

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Its overall trend is to run upwards

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And looking back

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
it doesn't need another pick

180
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
it directly this number

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
might break through

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
More than 140 or even 150 U.S. barrels

183
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so in a short time

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
such a rise

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This is why our

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My senior, Vice President Peng's junior

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Minister of Xie Enxiang Yuan

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It was the first class in Takao's class in the Department of Chemical Medicine

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
you see obviously he has a headache

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In fact, it should be our headache.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Because this is at least a 10% increase

192
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
is about to see

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So these two slides show

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Equal to the crisis is a problem all over the world

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,700
But I think there is one more important thing

196
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,860
In fact, it is for Taiwan

197
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,260
Might be a big problem too

198
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,960
There is an important reason is

199
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,300
Taiwan actually has almost no natural energy

200
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,000
That looks tricky

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,800
If we all rely on the outside

202
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,700
what to do next

203
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,000
Of course, from the perspective of economic development

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,300
this is a problem

205
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,400
this is my first question

206
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,100
I may ask a lot of questions today

207
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,700
In fact, I will not provide an answer

208
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm thinking

209
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,700
All our people and experts in Taiwan

210
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,300
should all come face to face with us

211
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,800
things to face

212
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,600
I have a lot of stories to tell today

213
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,900
The first one I talked about is Easter Island in the Pacific

214
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,800
This is Glass Muscia

215
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,100
in the Pacific Ocean

216
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,700
the easternmost island

217
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,000
In such a big cloud head

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,300
it's actually invisible

219
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,200
Taiwan can be found in this place at least on the map

220
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,600
Actually Easter Island is closer

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
South America so actually belongs to Chile

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,500
such a small island

223
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
its most special thing

224
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
is it along all the coastlines

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,500
There are many people's head portraits standing

226
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,000
Some are standing to watch the sunrise

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
Some are standing to watch the sunset

228
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,500
So often a whole row by the sea

229
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,000
You can see this giant stone statue

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,500
been full for a while

231
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
more than a hundred years

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,500
It's because everyone doesn't know why it looks like this

233
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
will be there

234
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Of course this gives us Taiwan

235
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Especially the key report of Taiwan

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,500
such programs

237
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,000
one of my life's big wishes

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
just hold a new event

239
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
The new program called Non-Critical Reports

240
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,500
They said this thing was visited by aliens

241
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
What has been what a ladder

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What did the visit say a lot

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,400
This island is actually quite special.

244
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,320
Because when the Europeans went to the island

245
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,280
They're actually a lost island

246
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,320
But a few hundred years ago

247
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,000
he used to have a coconut tree for the restaurant

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,640
It is better than the one from National Taiwan University

249
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,680
And there is this so-called great prince in the Central Plains Court

250
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,120
taller coconut tree

251
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,640
the whole island is coconut grove

252
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,120
It's really a forest of coconut trees

253
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,800
you can see the back of this

254
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
almost photogenic

255
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,760
So its decline and the change of resources on it

256
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,240
In fact, it has a lot to do with

257
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,640
Another thing is that the Maya of America

258
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,120
This is another place where aliens have been

259
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,160
OK

260
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,840
We still have a few places that we can look at one by one

261
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,320
words of aztec civilization

262
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,840
from the thirteenth century to the seventeenth century

263
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,120
you can see their temple of the sun

264
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,080
In fact, there are many pyramids in Egypt.

265
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,700
There is a little specific flavor

266
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,500
In fact, there are movies that have already been filmed

267
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
In fact, they often do restricted activities when they go up.

268
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,700
But the whole building feels very modern

269
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,000
That is to say they are very primitive looking although limited in activity

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Many places in their buildings actually seem to be related to mathematics

271
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,500
In fact, there is also an astronomical relationship.

272
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,500
Composite is pretty good

273
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
This is actually not very strange

274
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Because a building like this is actually a human tool

275
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,000
Human tools without support from mathematics and physics

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,500
By experience, people have had a long time

277
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Can show very brilliant achievements in architecture

278
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,000
Of course, in addition to that, they are full of special

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,500
They have some special astrological characters

280
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
These astrological characters are comparisons

281
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
early travel

282
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,700
Comparing text that is not a monogram

283
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,200
Now many of them have been revealed

284
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
It can be seen that this civilization

285
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
In fact, it has its degree of brilliance

286
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,300
Of course, including some of their statues

287
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,800
These statues are even more

288
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,800
There are many key reports that are full of words.

289
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,800
The other one in Blue America is the Inca civilization

290
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,800
exactly in central america and blue america

291
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,500
The timing of the two shaking echoes is not very consistent

292
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,600
this is a little later

293
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,100
Around the 15th, 40th and 16th centuries

294
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,800
It was later wiped out by the Europeans

295
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,300
Inca kingdom it's actually a very special one

296
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,800
It's on the hills of Kalamahah

297
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,100
There are very high mountains with very delicate buildings

298
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,300
Inside this exquisite building

299
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,300
Including very complex irrigation facilities and

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
The constructed system

301
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
These systems are very

302
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
researched a lot

303
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
In about National Geographic

304
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
is the country's first magazine

305
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
it already has a lot of videos

306
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
can introduce

307
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
How are these buildings made?

308
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
is a very detailed building

309
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
talking about this

310
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
This is one of the reasons why I am interested

311
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I probably will today

312
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
not the first time

313
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I will mention it a few times later

314
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
the representatives such a person

315
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
because the man he wrote the basic book

316
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
in my recent years

317
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
When the general education courses offered by Taiwan University at the beginning of the year

318
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
have used his book

319
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
as a textbook

320
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
because answered me some

321
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
very important question

322
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
This is a thicker book

323
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
called Clares

324
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Chinese translation into big collapse

325
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Should be China Times

326
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
The times see what they say

327
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Times Publishing is their book

328
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
This one should have won a Pulis Award

329
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
His book is called Da Bang Huai

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,260
Another word to repeat

331
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,760
in a society

332
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,460
how to choose

333
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,760
whether they succeed or fail

334
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,460
I believe no society

335
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,260
Will hope to choose to go down the road of failure

336
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,460
But at the end

337
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,660
Why are they such a brilliant civilization

338
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
unsustainable

339
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,760
can't continue

340
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,460
these splendid civilizations

341
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,160
What kind of mistake did you make?

342
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,000
Or encountered some kind of scourge

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,960
make them suffer

344
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
sorry

345
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
another question i want to ask

346
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
that is

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
in every society

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,500
We know that in modern terms

349
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
The average IQ is about the same

350
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
But why some civilizations

351
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
in a world

352
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,000
role played today

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There are particularly prominent places

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Is it true that in some societies

355
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,000
Its collective intelligence is higher

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
collective intelligence

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
there is a higher place

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,040
Is the difference in height a personal material inside?

359
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,040
There is a difference between the average and the high and low

360
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,680
What kind of society is it that reaches some consensus

361
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,240
make them make decisions that lead to death

362
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,080
Some are destined for greater glory

363
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,840
So if you see our Taiwan Legislative Yuan

364
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,200
You will wonder why a group of

365
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,440
It stands to reason that smart people will work together to make some

366
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,320
stupid thing

367
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,200
For many years their names were worn on their vests

368
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,960
So we don't have to figure out who it is.

369
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,160
Fortunately, this is in the Legislative Yuan

370
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
If this kind of thing happened in college

371
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,000
This problem becomes serious

372
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,360
So in my speech today

373
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,320
Its outline will probably be discussed from several different projects

374
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,160
Maybe it's because I'm a scientist personally

375
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,200
I will definitely learn from the energy in the universe and nature

376
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,080
talk about these things

377
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,960
Yes and then of course it will soon cut to life and human

378
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,880
go inside the circle

379
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,000
love with people

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,240
In fact, it is closely related

381
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,040
And the development of every civilization

382
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,000
It's all about popularity

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm not actually very detailed

384
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,240
Let's talk about the details

385
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,040
because of our problem

386
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,140
will focus on popularity and sustainable civilization

387
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,200
this photo is very famous

388
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,240
It's Apollo 17

389
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,000
in may be

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,740
late 60's

391
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,140
Photos taken when I went to space

392
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,440
This one may be so far

393
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,240
Photos of Earth are referenced

394
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,640
one of the most pictures

395
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,040
you can see the arabian peninsula very clearly

396
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,640
and the region from Africa all the way to Antarctica

397
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,240
is very clear

398
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,280
in history

399
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,180
not too many people have a chance

400
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,040
able to see the landscape like this

401
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,740
see our hometown

402
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,640
The entire spherical shape can be seen very clearly

403
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,840
But if we look at it historically

404
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,480
this Heraclitus

405
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,640
In fact strictly speaking

406
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,240
These are more philosophers

407
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,240
i don't think we will

408
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
treat them as scientists

409
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,000
when he was in greek times

410
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
sorry over here

411
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
not very clear

412
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,500
Should be BC

413
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Around the fifth or sixth century

414
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
He already mentioned one thing

415
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,500
The world is actually a combination of many states

416
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,000
And between these states and states

417
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
In fact, it has a rheological change

418
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
his famous saying

419
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,000
He said every morning a new sun rises

420
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So he said fire is the source of all matter

421
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That is, in Greece from about the third century to the fifth century

422
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
people kept coming out and saying

423
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
this world

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The very rich and diverse landscapes we see

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
In fact, there are very simple elements

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Telus was first proposed

427
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
he said it was water

428
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But the green map master Herac said

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He said it should be fire

430
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
when going from his point of view

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
lead to later clark

432
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
sorry it should be

433
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,260
I forgot the name

434
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,500
And then there's Aristotle, he's talking about the four elements

435
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,240
Your boss said he included fire as a key element.

436
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,060
But if it is in our modern times

437
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,560
You saw a very important telescope in the 90s

438
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,440
NASA put it in the sky

439
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,760
We call it the Hubble Telescope because it's a memorial

440
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,260
The one who said the universe is expanding

441
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,220
haber mentioned his name

442
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,620
as the name of the telescope

443
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,720
When it was put up, there were several kinds of lenses on it.

444
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,220
X-ray lens included Infrared lens included Ultraviolet lens included

445
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:42,920
There are a lot of telescopic lenses on it

446
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,720
In fact, when I first put it on, it seemed that one of the lenses was broken.

447
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,920
So the space shuttle was sent up to recalibrate it.

448
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,720
replaced with a new one

449
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,720
This is a very important tool

450
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,520
Since the family is slightly used in

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
After seeing the moons next to Jupiter with a telescope four hundred years ago

452
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
After putting this on

453
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What he saw turned out to be a very different landscape

454
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Because of its Scope

455
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We emphasize that this Scope is a field of vision

456
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It actually works on a telescope

457
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Telescope is the field of view circled

458
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
is right in the distance

459
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This is exactly the same as Microscope, which is a microscope.

460
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The field of view it circles is placed in a very close distance.

461
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
is a very different thing

462
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Scientists choose Scope

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That is, our eyes are chosen

464
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
see what the target above

465
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
makes us use the special method

466
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
special tools see special things

467
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
This is a very important thing in the development of science

468
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The results provided

469
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
In fact, the one that proves that the universe is expanding is called

470
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The so-called Big Bang theory of the explosion

471
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
you can tell

472
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
We actually see pictures made of galaxies and clouds

473
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
like fragments after an explosion

474
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
fly away form

475
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Such proof is actually not enough

476
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Another fact seen

477
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is the whole universe

478
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
it's actually in the process of exploding

479
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
it's been a very long time

480
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That is, the farthest light

481
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
After collecting

482
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
We found that in fact the explosion time of the entire universe

483
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
has been carried over to a very precise number

484
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Relatively speaking, 13.7 billion years

485
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
i remember when i was studying

486
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
When studying in middle school and university

487
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The figure given at that time was about 10 billion to 15 billion

488
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We already feel that it is not easy

489
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
very precise number

490
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Now what Haberwang has told us is that

491
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
13.7 billion years

492
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
during this time

493
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In fact, there is a point of time

494
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Where is this plot in the space

495
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
not sure

496
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But after a big bang

497
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
it keeps expanding

498
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Inflation is actually spread out over an almost flat universe

499
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The expansion process of the explosion is not linear yet.

500
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That is to say, it even has cases of accelerated expansion.

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That is, if you look at it from the present point of view

502
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The universe is actually still expanding

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But one important thing is

504
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
if you push it back

505
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Its basis is in fact

506
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
because it was a big bang

507
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
so it's a big energy

508
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Transformation created matter after it exploded

509
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
There is an interchanging state between man and matter

510
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
for us now

511
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Today's science we have been able to describe

512
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Our universe has many examples that make up it

513
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
There are many examples of pillows especially on the earth

514
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that is atoms

515
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But if we look carefully

516
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The universe is not what we imagined

517
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's really the same as our earth

518
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
There are many principles

519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Main ingredient with wrinkle head

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Atomic substances are mainly pure and harmful elements

521
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If you have a little background in chemistry

522
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
At least clear is one of the simplest elements

523
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hazard is an element slightly heavier than it

524
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But the combined weight of these two

525
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Actually not many

526
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If we list all the percentages

527
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You can see the darker, black piece over here

528
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We now call it dark energy

529
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
In other words don't know what kind of energy it is

530
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Then here is the lighter black piece

531
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
is dark matter 30% 65%

532
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Together it makes up 95% of the universe

533
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
That is 95% of the universe

534
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
we don't know what it is

535
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What we really know about Qing and Hari

536
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
In terms of the scope it occupies

537
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's actually a very small part

538
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Of course there are some other elements that are less than Qinghe Harm

539
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Let's look at it from here

540
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,300
If you look at it, the part with the most cloud heads in the universe is called green

541
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,200
Blue accounts for 60% and black accounts for 36% or 37%

542
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,700
Together it exceeds 95%

543
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,800
But this 95% is a relatively small amount in terms of the entire cosmic cloud head

544
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,900
Of course, the other part of us is not the same as on the earth.

545
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,900
The most abundant part of the earth is actually iron

546
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,900
But most of the iron is in the center of the earth, not in the crust

547
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,800
If you look at it from the inside of the earth's crust

548
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,600
Its most part should be oxygen and then fine

549
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,400
These are all different elements, which is what you must know when you study chemistry.

550
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,800
But because there is a lot of water in our living body, more than 75% is water

551
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,300
So you see, 65% is oxygen, and other words, blue accounts for 10%

552
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,500
So this together is mostly water

553
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,800
But our body contains a lot of carbon

554
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,700
So it means the part we are most familiar with

555
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,100
Including ourselves, including the earth we live on

556
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,400
Everything is completely different from the environment outside our earth.

557
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,200
Of course, if we look at it from the perspective of the entire universe

558
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,800
We just said the transition from energy to matter

559
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,100
In fact, physicists are still spending a lot of effort to understand this process

560
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:26,300
However, there are some gradually more evidences showing that

561
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,100
There are actually a lot of clouds in Cosmos

562
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,800
it actually has mass

563
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,100
A phenomenon common to all matter is that it has mass

564
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,900
large or small mass

565
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,100
Although it is a small thing

566
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,900
If it's a lot, it still has a lot of gravity

567
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,600
It can be regarded as internal attraction, after being greedy and shrinking, it will produce scars

568
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,600
Therefore, a circle mark heart actually undergoes greed and shrinkage.

569
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,800
it may become a scar

570
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,500
But there are big and small scars

571
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,800
If you look at it from the heart

572
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
At its center, what actually happens is a nuclear reaction.

573
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,200
One of the two types of nuclear reactions is nuclear fission

574
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,520
A kind of nuclear fusion

575
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,320
In fact it is because its content is mostly hydrogen

576
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
So it's hydrogen atoms that produce nuclear fusion

577
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,000
will form elements that slowly become comparisons

578
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,200
If the star is big enough

579
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,400
It goes through nuclear fusion like this

580
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,080
Over time it will become a red giant star

581
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,720
The red giant is actually at the end

582
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,080
Its nuclear burn is very fast

583
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,080
after such a rapid burn

584
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,640
produces a lot of heavier elements

585
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,640
when it dies

586
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
there was a big bang

587
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Such explosions could produce superstars

588
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,400
After this kind of superstar disperses the new elements around

589
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,840
It may again form a new solar system

590
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,840
this is endless

591
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,320
But if it is a smaller star

592
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,520
when it has no chance of forming a red giant

593
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,920
as soon as it goes to become a white dwarf

594
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,880
so in fact

595
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
The ending may be different

596
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,920
This is not my own professional field

597
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,360
But at least we can see a new sun every day

598
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,560
So when stars are in billions of years

599
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,680
Our sun is actually five billion years old

600
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,760
lifespan of about five billion years

601
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,520
This lifespan is very close to the lifespan of the earth

602
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,560
Earth's lifespan is currently estimated at 4.6 billion years

603
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,040
It is estimated that our sun should have another five billion years to survive

604
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,880
So the earth doesn't actually have to worry about the sun's last time

605
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Our sun will finally become a red giant star

606
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,960
Then the words of the leader throughout the planetary system

607
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,400
It is probably light and harmful is the main

608
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,680
But the other one percent is other elements

609
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,560
This is so important to us

610
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,720
because few things seem

611
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,240
Instead, the rarest things around us

612
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,440
let's take a look

613
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,960
Let's go back and look at the previous one just now

614
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,080
The last point is actually right

615
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It was rice ear swallow 200 years ago

616
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
it raises an important concept

617
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Because we just mentioned the name of the element

618
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
In fact every element

619
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Its units are atoms

620
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Then if you have the same elements

621
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
its atoms are the same

622
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You if the elements are different

623
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
its atoms are different words

624
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
This is what we started in middle school

625
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Atomic Blade

626
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
is what's inside

627
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
things like this

628
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
when already looking out

629
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Kiss is indeed the most swallowed element in the universe

630
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Although we say that there are many things

631
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
something that is not an element

632
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The proportion is quite high

633
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But if the already known elements swallow their heads

634
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Kiss is still the most content

635
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
At the same time it is also persevering

636
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
main ingredient

637
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'm taking this time to tell you about this

638
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It is to let everyone experience one thing

639
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
between energy and matter

640
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
The relationship is actually very close

641
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
What kind of environmental conditions is the problem

642
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
such as temperature or

643
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,640
Kinetic energy of matter itself

644
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,560
enabling them to move between pools and people

645
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,360
mutual change

646
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,600
In fact, speaking of chemistry

647
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,680
change between energy and matter

648
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,600
it has very specific rules

649
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,480
For example, if you look at it like a blue atom

650
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,880
It has only one Naoko in the center

651
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,880
There will be an electron outside

652
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,080
So we say that the blue atom has a direct son

653
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,880
and an electron

654
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,280
but above the sun

655
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,200
its son

656
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,800
Two pairs of sons will be fused

657
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,080
in the process of fusion

658
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,680
and many smaller examples

659
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,160
For example, neutrinos

660
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,760
Zhengzi

661
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
A positron is the opposite of an electron

662
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,600
The quality is the same as that of electrons

663
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,080
But electricity and electrons are just the opposite

664
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,160
It's on standby

665
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,600
put something like this out

666
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,440
then it will generate

667
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,360
Naoko

668
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,400
but neutrons

669
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,880
After Naoko and Naoko got together

670
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,600
it has the opportunity to generate new elements

671
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,960
so keep going down

672
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,760
it becomes a practiced display

673
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,160
go down

674
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,500
It can even release Gama rays

675
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
so straight out

676
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,000
and then into a new substance

677
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It can be harmful in the end

678
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,500
That is, throughout the development process

679
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Although not achieved in one step

680
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,000
But in the end we know that the sun is

681
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Constant consumption is kinder

682
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Shouldn't it be kind, should it be pro-atomic?

683
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,500
then produce harmful atoms

684
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,000
But there are other ways, dear, there are actually two

685
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,500
That is to say it has a finger

686
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,000
So it's a kiss but with a middle finger at the same time

687
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,500
This is what we call a knife

688
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
There is also a pointing

689
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
then there are two middle fingers

690
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,000
As long as you have one pointing finger, it belongs to the relatives anyway.

691
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
belonging to the same number of relatives

692
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
If these two things collide

693
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,500
It can also produce a harmful atom

694
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,000
Contains two middle fingers and two fingers

695
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,500
That is, we can write it in chemical formula

696
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
it can be harmful and

697
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,000
Situations like this happen every day

698
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
it happens on the sun

699
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,800
But in the part of its comparison

700
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,200
In fact there are some heavier elements

701
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,300
the heaviest sinks in the middle

702
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,800
very little

703
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
But most of them are outside

704
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,300
Layer by layer, according to its density

705
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,000
can be distinguished

706
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So it can actually produce eggs

707
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,500
can produce oxygen

708
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,200
So we just mentioned

709
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,700
words at the center of the star

710
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,200
If you go through nuclear fusion continuously

711
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,600
heavy elements will occur

712
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
So for example like a carbon atom

713
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,300
like nitrogen atom

714
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,500
In fact, if we continue to integrate

715
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,500
nitrogen atom followed by hydrogen atom

716
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,900
Fusion into oxygen atoms

717
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,400
So keep it up and you'll find

718
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,000
It has new elements coming out all the time

719
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,300
see it this way

720
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
our solar system

721
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,400
should have been

722
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,200
A sun has already exploded

723
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,100
into a super new system

724
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,500
and re-transform into one of our planetary systems

725
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,200
It should be so

726
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,300
so in this

727
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,400
the mystery of its energy

728
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,100
just press

729
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,300
proposed

730
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,500
If you have to sacrifice a little material quality

731
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,300
to generate energy

732
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,700
its often tiny mass

733
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,700
multiply by the speed of light

734
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,700
That is, the square of an astronomical number

735
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,500
make it produce huge lotus kernels

736
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,300
This kind of energy is very large

737
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,800
but so far

738
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Humans have not yet been able to take full advantage of

739
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,800
other than using it as a bomb

740
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,300
there seems to be no good way

741
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,900
take full advantage of

742
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,900
But in the US and in the UK

743
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,400
There are some cohesive atomic furnaces

744
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,900
are doing experimental research

745
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
hope to find

746
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,200
can we replace

747
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,400
Now new personnel come to use

748
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Except for the case of the sun

749
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,900
It also emits what we call light

750
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,100
what is light

751
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,900
In fact, from a more scientific point of view,

752
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,400
The stars are actually emitting battery radiation

753
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
In fact, it is a dose of radiation

754
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
The amount of radiation

755
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
what we call light

756
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,600
The reason is because in all its range

757
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,000
quite a while

758
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,600
We human eyes can see

759
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,000
call it visible light

760
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,200
In the shorter wavelength part of visible light

761
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,600
and the longer part of the words

762
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
we have some names

763
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,400
Some of the names are familiar

764
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,600
For example, the possibility of relative cosmic color lines

765
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,400
Gamma color line because now the brain

766
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,200
If there is a flow knife

767
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,800
We say Gamma knife refers to Gamma color line

768
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,200
Then the X-ray is from Professor Wang Yu.

769
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,800
research expertise

770
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
Then at the wavelength towards

771
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
words here

772
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
stick to visible light

773
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,600
The shorter wavelength on the left is ultraviolet light

774
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,000
Infrared rays with longer wavelengths

775
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
if you go down

776
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,200
microwaves are radio waves

777
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,000
It's all familiar to everyone.

778
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,200
In this posture

779
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,600
We call it photoreplenishment

780
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,200
this is gossip

781
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
what does it teach us

782
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
we just said

783
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,000
Scientists must have a special scope

784
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,400
to see special targets

785
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,100
the same reason

786
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,500
Spectroscopy also allows us to see

787
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,300
We use different wavelengths

788
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,200
Or if you look at it with frequency light

789
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,700
We can see inside matter

790
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,800
different phenomena

791
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,200
don't go into detail about what kind of phenomenon

792
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,100
But these different phenomena

793
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,400
In fact, it allows us to have new perspectives and perspectives

794
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,800
say again

795
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,700
Tell us the tool should be right

796
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,000
And look for the right direction

797
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,200
as if you see

798
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,700
if you want to watch desktop

799
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,400
I probably wouldn't intentionally switch to a Chinese-style channel.

800
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,200
So I just have to see desktops on that channel

801
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,800
then we will never see

802
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,300
The reason is very simple

803
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,000
Another form of energy deserves our attention

804
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,800
chemical energy

805
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,000
This is especially true on Earth

806
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,400
more noticeable energy

807
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,000
We just said that the interaction of functions

808
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Most of the aforementioned nuclear energy

809
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,200
But when matter is formed

810
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,800
often release energy

811
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,900
if it is destroyed

812
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,600
often absorb energy

813
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,900
In fact, if we put it in more precise terms

814
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,140
From your chemist's point of view

815
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,340
It should be about atoms bonded together

816
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,640
if you pull it out

817
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,440
You have to give it its full amount

818
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,240
If the separated atoms

819
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,840
if you want to tie it together

820
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,740
it will surely let people out

821
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,740
This is from a scientist's point of view

822
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
is a rule like this

823
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,340
If we use this picture to see

824
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,740
If this axis is the original quantity

825
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,040
If this axis is the distance between atoms

826
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,780
You will find that when you put two pro-atoms

827
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,940
let it get closer

828
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,180
Its original volume is to go to the bottom

829
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,480
and when you go to the lowest place

830
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,780
Logically, it is the most stable place

831
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,780
That is, many middle school students here

832
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,440
What you learned in middle school or high school failed

833
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,440
also failed at the lowest time

834
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,880
it should be most stable

835
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,180
But if you let it get closer

836
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,080
electron and atom box inside it

837
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,840
there is power

838
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,240
so it deliberately pushes them back apart

839
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,740
So the number will rise again

840
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,520
So probably when stable

841
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,640
it's all within this range

842
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,120
So its distance has a stable range

843
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,240
Of course if you give it energy

844
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,520
let it climb

845
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,760
Just like we need energy to climb a mountain

846
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,280
Let it go when the distance gets farther and farther

847
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,240
you can take it apart

848
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,200
So chemical energy is what makes matter

849
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,480
when forming and breaking

850
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,560
The number of people incidental to the change

851
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,160
At this time there will be a

852
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,600
Scientists have two perspectives to see things

853
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,840
If you consider matter as the subject

854
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
you will find

855
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,280
The substance is changing its form

856
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,080
For example, the atoms I just mentioned

857
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,040
when combined

858
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,240
or when separated

859
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,960
or when new substances are formed

860
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,480
when rearranging

861
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,640
it will have to come in or go out with the energy

862
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
So as if matter is the subject

863
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,560
energy is class

864
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,200
energy goes out

865
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,360
But you also have another way to see it

866
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,960
regard energy as subject

867
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,360
And if we regard the matter as a subject

868
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,860
When energy changes from high to low in that place

869
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,520
Matter follows, so we have to accept a little more energy

870
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,400
If it receives less energy, its shape will change back and forth

871
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,780
So watch your goals look at energy

872
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,380
still look at the material

873
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,520
All in all, a very basic concept

874
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,320
Not just nuclear energy or chemical energy

875
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,560
its different sizes

876
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,560
But it will be accompanied by changes in matter

877
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,620
This is the most important point

878
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,380
if you don't study science

879
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,620
At least you know that energy is always following the change of matter

880
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,960
on our planet, especially

881
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,520
In the top of the air, there are many small molecules

882
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,700
For example, oxygen is familiar to everyone

883
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,760
That carbon dioxide is what everyone hates

884
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,320
Carbon dioxide, everyone is afraid of hearing it now

885
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,320
then carbon dioxide

886
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,800
Carbon dioxide is also poisonous

887
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,260
But in our body

888
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,960
It is very important for nerve conduction

889
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,600
Holiday night can be regarded as

890
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,200
gas to burn

891
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,300
Peace of mind

892
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,800
or sulfur dioxide

893
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,500
So you will find that there are many substances

894
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,700
Can be spread in our atmospheric city

895
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,200
by us

896
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,700
increasingly familiar substances

897
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,600
I was very familiar with matter when I didn't know science before

898
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,300
like this

899
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,000
it side

900
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,700
blue is

901
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:24,900
Green molecules

902
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,100
red oxygen molecule

903
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,100
and after you burn it

904
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,500
it can combine into water molecules

905
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,700
So this one that looks like Mickey Mouse's head

906
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,900
with two ears

907
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,900
water molecules

908
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,300
other small molecules

909
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,700
I won't go into detail

910
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,300
but macromolecules

911
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,100
like our genetics

912
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,400
this

913
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,000
genetic code

914
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,200
Responsible DNA

915
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
its atoms

916
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,600
The atoms in a molecule are at least

917
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,100
more than a thousand

918
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,900
so you can tell

919
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,600
At least hundreds of thousands of atoms

920
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,100
is very large

921
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,100
so simple

922
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
Whether it is a simple molecule or a complex molecule

923
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
This is what caused our earth

924
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,700
One of the most basic reasons why its landscape is so diverse

925
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,500
So we say that when the sun uses electromagnetic radiation

926
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:16,200
It is far from feeling that the energy is sent to the planet

927
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
The matter on the planet because of the incoming energy

928
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,500
it can start to change

929
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,400
This is the change between people and matter that I just emphasized again and again

930
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,000
Nature begins with nuclear energy and head and chemical energy and head

931
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,600
Transformed its matter and created our world

932
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,100
One of them is that everyone often

933
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,100
Even in recent years, students often hear

934
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,000
What you often see in the newspapers is the greenhouse effect

935
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,800
The greenhouse effect is what I just said

936
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,200
Often when the media introduces them inaccurately

937
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,000
Now quite a lot of people are scared when they hear about the greenhouse effect

938
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,200
Think that the greenhouse effect after the increase of carbon dioxide

939
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,600
will make our temperature higher and higher

940
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,000
Then we just get sadder and sadder

941
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,840
And it's causing big changes in the climate

942
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,640
Count all the burials on it

943
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,040
In fact, the greenhouse effect is harmful to the ability of human beings to live in this world.

944
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,960
A very important life-saving effect

945
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,360
Because when the sun shines radiation on the earth,

946
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,800
it will reflect back

947
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,080
after reflecting back

948
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,400
There are actually some molecules in the top of the atmosphere here.

949
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,520
Putting it in the atmosphere can reflect it back

950
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,920
So look at the picture below

951
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,600
It is easier for everyone to understand

952
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,560
Infrared rays actually affect the greenhouse effect

953
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,240
The most critical radiation dose

954
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,040
It's because of incoming radiation

955
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,560
when reflected

956
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,240
it doesn't all go out

957
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,520
it's blocked by some gas and put back

958
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,000
some infrared light here

959
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,400
is actually what keeps our planet warm

960
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,440
actually very gentle

961
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,640
Why do we say that the temperature of the earth is very mild?

962
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,080
because the surface of the sun

963
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,040
should not say it is the surface

964
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,000
this calendar

965
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,720
It should be 6000 degrees C

966
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,880
Yes, if we want to encounter such an environment

967
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,500
we say dire straits

968
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,680
Probably our whole body is gasified

969
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,120
impossible

970
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,300
If you go to read history

971
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,640
When Pompeii was covered by volcanoes

972
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,800
When its hot air sweeps over people

973
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,400
less than 6000 degrees

974
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,000
The temperature of thousands of degrees is already

975
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,520
Everyone gasified and exploded.

976
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,880
But if it's in the desert

977
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,800
The temperature is relatively high

978
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,600
It may be higher than 40 degrees

979
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,280
words from the rainforest

980
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,600
Similar to today's Taipei

981
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,840
35 degrees C

982
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,920
If Antarctica

983
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,160
The average temperature can be maintained below zero

984
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,280
The words of the ocean are in fact the hub of regulation

985
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,000
the average temperature on Earth

986
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,280
Should be around 15 degrees C

987
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,160
lowest words

988
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,040
It's hard to get below -50 degrees C on earth

989
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,800
It's hard to be higher than 10 degrees C at noon

990
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,400
So it is relative to the scale of facilities

991
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,000
100 degrees C is not a very wide range

992
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
It's not like we don't talk about Mars today

993
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,400
On Mars, 200 degrees C at night

994
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,600
It gets up to 400 degrees C during the day

995
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,200
This change is hundreds of degrees C

996
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,400
so the difference can be huge

997
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,400
In addition to the atmosphere

998
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,800
Other aspects of the crust can pay a little attention

999
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,200
I can actually speed up this part a bit.

1000
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,600
You will find that our earth is not a uniform sphere

1001
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,200
It has a core and a core that we call geochill

1002
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,600
In fact, what we are most familiar with is actually the surface of the earth.

1003
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,200
the part called the crust

1004
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,200
because it is a hard shape

1005
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,400
Hard shape means we stand on it

1006
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,200
it is hard

1007
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,400
not like jupiter

1008
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,400
We have four hard shapes which are Mercury, Venus, Mars and Earth

1009
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,000
These four are hard shapes

1010
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But others such as Jupiter

1011
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Purus Uranus Neptune

1012
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,700
are gaseous planets

1013
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,900
For a hard cross planet like this

1014
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,700
in terms of its entire structure

1015
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,200
Earth Chill and Earth and Yes are in it

1016
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,300
It is obvious that the middle longitudinal density is high

1017
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,800
It's a little less dense here

1018
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,200
outermost minimum

1019
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,900
Indicates that chemistry has a

1020
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,100
Chemical consonance means according to density

1021
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,300
Sink vertically Float upward gently

1022
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,700
That's what I mean

1023
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,300
So roughly speaking

1024
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,000
The lightest density is probably outside the crust

1025
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,900
But in the part where the ground is cold

1026
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,800
it actually has some heat

1027
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,100
let out the heat

1028
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,600
is to make it convective

1029
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
convection phenomenon that is

1030
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,500
hot part

1031
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,100
its density will be lower

1032
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,900
just run up

1033
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,700
Just like our air

1034
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,900
so don't look

1035
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,300
Are you saying that this is not the lithosphere of soil rocks?

1036
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,000
it can still flow

1037
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,300
slow flow

1038
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,000
So there is convection

1039
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,700
so when

1040
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
words at the core

1041
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It has no effect on the surface temperature

1042
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
But for the convective part of the cold

1043
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
it may have an effect

1044
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
especially if there is gas in it

1045
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
a class of explosive words

1046
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It might have erupted from a volcano.

1047
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
let's jump over

1048
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So volcanoes are relative to the surface

1049
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
is a very important thing

1050
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
We often say that the surface of the earth

1051
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
is a living form

1052
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
One of the very important reasons

1053
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
That is, we now have active volcanoes for everyone

1054
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Still working on the surface

1055
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Datun Mountain is a repair volcano

1056
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
On the face of it

1057
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
no very clear apparent activity

1058
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
But in fact judging from its flow prevention pit

1059
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
still working

1060
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Maybe hundreds of years or a thousand years from now

1061
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It might explode again

1062
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But in the Atlantic

1063
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
we can see an obvious

1064
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
from the cold

1065
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,200
all the way to the surface

1066
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
it's because of the persistent heat

1067
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,700
Convection like this is maintained

1068
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,400
Then the gas comes out

1069
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,500
so that the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean

1070
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,500
Expand to both sides

1071
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,500
so it has an atlantic level ditch

1072
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,000
still going on

1073
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,500
broadened process development

1074
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,800
still under development

1075
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,200
So this magma its movement

1076
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,800
Earth's surface provided

1077
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,500
very important vitality

1078
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,800
We even say it is the vitality of construction

1079
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:31,500
for example

1080
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,300
Look carefully at the words of the Atlantic class

1081
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,800
it comes out warm sea water

1082
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
around this

1083
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,300
We used to think that in this hotter seawater

1084
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,500
no living things

1085
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,900
now we find

1086
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,100
In fact, at such a high temperature

1087
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,200
There are still very special creatures

1088
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,300
And it has good nutrients to grow

1089
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,400
So don't read that in this

1090
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
at such a high temperature

1091
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,400
It is not easy to say that biological survival

1092
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,700
In fact, organisms are very easy to adapt to the environment

1093
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,340
So we have a saying here

1094
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,400
The earth is like Athena in Greek mythology

1095
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,960
It has both properties

1096
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,940
It seems to have the wisdom of all things

1097
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,820
But on the other hand it also has a lot of violence

1098
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,800
You sometimes see disasters happening on Earth

1099
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,540
key report

1100
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,860
The key report is that

1101
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,320
It's not that aliens are coming, it's that

1102
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,960
Then there is something special

1103
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,640
For example, Mr. Wang is going to run away somewhere to hide.

1104
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,100
From the point of view of scientists

1105
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,440
nature is not particularly kind

1106
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,760
But it doesn't have to be particularly cruel

1107
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,820
most likely it manifests

1108
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,600
sometimes we feel indifferent

1109
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,920
when its violence chokes some life

1110
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,720
we sometimes think it's cold

1111
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,020
But when it is experienced in all things

1112
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,580
We think it's actually full of cancer

1113
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:56,140
That's why the Greeks called it Mother Earth

1114
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,980
In the process of the development of the earth I just said that we have

1115
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
about 4.6 billion years ago

1116
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The scale actually makes it very wide

1117
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
If it's 4.6 billion years here

1118
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
That's 4 billion years

1119
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So here it is 2.1 billion years

1120
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
1.1 billion years here

1121
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
500 million years here

1122
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
If we look a little closer

1123
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
earliest stone found

1124
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
approximately over 4 billion years

1125
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
is a stone found in Australia

1126
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
you will find

1127
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
1984 is very close to now

1128
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
But about 30 years

1129
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
ingredients in it

1130
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
In fact, using the current single catty analysis

1131
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
can already be seen

1132
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
you can clearly see

1133
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It has two metal atoms in it

1134
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
one is high

1135
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
one is young

1136
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
In other words, of course, there are sheep

1137
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So we already know the ingredients

1138
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
stone like this

1139
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
it's actually igneous rock

1140
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
was produced at a very early age

1141
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
except this

1142
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
there are still some very old rocks on earth

1143
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
For example, it was discovered in Canada in the 1940s

1144
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It is in fact in Greenland, Iceland, probably

1145
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Earlier rocks were found in that area

1146
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Also some bacteria

1147
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Of course, this bacterium is no longer a living bacterium.

1148
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
actually a fossil

1149
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So judging by its size

1150
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Very likely a fossil of bacteria

1151
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Its size is actually only 10 to 20

1152
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
We can only do micron

1153
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's 10 belly fat

1154
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
It was discovered more than 30 years ago

1155
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
In other words, the earliest life on earth

1156
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Probably more than 30 years from now

1157
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
the length of time

1158
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I have a lot of this time scale today

1159
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
tell everyone

1160
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I am slowly

1161
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
accumulated from reading different books

1162
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
So now I'm getting more and more familiar with this time scale.

1163
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,540
if you don't often hear

1164
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,540
Maybe it will be a little uncomfortable for a while

1165
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,540
35 years is very long

1166
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,540
Are some people not even 35 yet?

1167
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,540
Is it right

1168
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,540
If it's bacteria, let it

1169
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,540
It should mean that the cell wants it to

1170
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:19,040
It is more special if it contains the nucleus

1171
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,040
In fact, it's been almost a billion years.

1172
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,040
We are about 12 years old

1173
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,040
The present plant with a nucleus

1174
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,080
It's almost 12 years now

1175
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,080
A very important thing happened in the middle

1176
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,080
That is, when it is almost 21 years away

1177
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,080
Oxygen begins to be produced in large quantities on Earth

1178
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,080
Indicates that the earth was in the early days

1179
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,080
without as much oxygen as we have now

1180
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,080
So if there are other bacteria present at that time

1181
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,080
It doesn't live on oxygen

1182
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,080
eukaryotic cells for more than ten years

1183
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,120
really more like

1184
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,120
We look more like animals

1185
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,760
It's been around 500 million years

1186
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,640
Many people, especially children, know

1187
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,200
Reptiles were around 200 million years ago

1188
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,500
Just climbed from Mercury Head to the road

1189
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,760
Because when reptiles appear

1190
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,500
Dinosaurs also appeared

1191
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,500
So we look at it through the eyes of a chemist

1192
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,500
The most important life is to be able to survive

1193
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:26,800
That is to say, energy must come into it from the outside world.

1194
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,700
It is likely to flow into its body in the form of matter

1195
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,400
But when you go in, you have to generate energy

1196
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,300
make it work with energy

1197
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,100
this is any kind of life

1198
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,500
no matter what form it is

1199
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,500
We are also good

1200
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,900
or the smallest cell

1201
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,100
or bacteria

1202
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,100
should have such conditions

1203
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,700
We just talked about the time from 21 to 31 years

1204
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,500
In fact, some photosynthetic life has appeared

1205
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,800
In fact, you can now see blue-green algae

1206
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,100
Also it forms such cells

1207
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,100
In fact the first thing you see

1208
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
is green

1209
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,160
Everyone knows that green is because of the leaves of green trees.

1210
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,360
This picture is actually a chemist who wants to spend

1211
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,560
A picture that took a long time to understand

1212
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,900
There are still many things in it that we can't understand

1213
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,960
But at least everyone learned it in middle school

1214
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,960
If you take water and crocodile carbon as raw materials

1215
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,160
put the cells in the leaves to lead

1216
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,920
Relying on chlorophyll plus light, it is called photosynthesis

1217
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,320
it produces oxygen and glucose

1218
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,520
Symptoms actually have a very complicated operation of the number of people

1219
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:43,320
And the operation of this human quantity it goes from plant to animal

1220
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,560
have a similar mechanism at work

1221
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,760
Our so-called ADP ATP is actually called

1222
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:58,920
Dilingic acid is a kind of plum is a kind of enzyme

1223
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,720
ATP is Mitsubishi acid

1224
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,000
Alteration of trees by rhombic acid

1225
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,480
After making its chemical reaction happen

1226
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,800
There are changes in energy

1227
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,480
At the same time, if there is another breathing effect here

1228
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,360
Of course our bodies rely on oxygen to burn

1229
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,400
Provide energy for the functioning of our body

1230
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,360
So glucose can be used as fuel here

1231
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,080
So the two big cycles are chemically

1232
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,560
is very important

1233
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,560
Using chemistry to exchange between matter and energy

1234
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,400
make our lives work

1235
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,320
this is a very important thing

1236
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,520
But if we look at it from a historical perspective

1237
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,760
We were just talking about half a billion years ago

1238
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,240
In fact, there are a lot of special creatures appearing

1239
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,360
Let's see the next one will be more clear

1240
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,160
This time is about 500 million years

1241
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,800
It's called Han Wuji

1242
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,480
If you go to the Canadian Rockies

1243
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
look up

1244
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,520
Or if you go to see it in China's Yunnan and Guangxi areas

1245
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,040
You can find words like this

1246
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It can be seen as an animal

1247
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because it's not like a lobster, it's like a cockroach

1248
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
But now on earth

1249
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
you can't find it anywhere

1250
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
because almost the vast majority of

1251
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
They're all extinct

1252
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
it's almost in han wu ji

1253
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
That is, 500 million years from now

1254
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's all of a sudden gone extinct

1255
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
after extinction

1256
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Many fossils are left in the marble

1257
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
inside the rock formation

1258
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So when I just said that in Luojishan and

1259
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Southern part of mainland China

1260
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
can see

1261
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
But you now because it is a hard-shelled animal

1262
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So after you dug it out

1263
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
You find that its shape is still in that place

1264
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But when these creatures suddenly a large number

1265
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
dead when extinct

1266
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
there is a very interesting thing

1267
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
between 500 million and 200 million years

1268
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
there are very fast

1269
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Haiying head creatures are also good

1270
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
and creatures that walk on the ground

1271
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
rapid development

1272
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
What does this mean?

1273
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
when the environment is right

1274
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
some creatures are lost

1275
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
its chance of survival

1276
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Other creatures suddenly

1277
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
get its chance of survival

1278
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
In other words, what we now call the exchange of ecological blocks

1279
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Because if you give up your position

1280
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Then I'll sit down so the wind blows

1281
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So the earth is actually doing destructive creation again and again

1282
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Just like the volcano I just mentioned

1283
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
natural disasters on our earth

1284
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It's been decades

1285
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
never disappeared

1286
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
we can talk so much today

1287
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
like taiwan

1288
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Every year when a typhoon comes, we will be nervous

1289
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Because of landslides, right?

1290
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Every time an earthquake comes, we will be nervous

1291
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
don't know how much it will be

1292
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Even recently, everyone is a little worried about the tsunami

1293
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
If you take the 46-year time scale of the entire earth

1294
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
put it to the end of the day

1295
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
This is what many people can see in books

1296
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
In this way to describe the history of our earth

1297
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
it has a total of 24 hours

1298
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
In these 24 hours you

1299
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Really, when we just said that bacteria capable of photosynthesis appeared

1300
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It's almost morning

1301
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
That is to say, after 9 o'clock

1302
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Because it's 12 o'clock, so around 9 o'clock

1303
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
it just appeared

1304
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
before dawn

1305
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
what we can see

1306
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
In fact, it's just the germ of life

1307
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Sunshine bacteria only appear after dawn

1308
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The emergence of blue-green algae has reached noon

1309
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
We just said that after the emergence of nucleated dimensional organisms

1310
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Only then will there be real plants appearing behind

1311
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You see, the nucleated dimensional organisms are about a billion years old as we just said

1312
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
so it's already afternoon

1313
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
then it was early

1314
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I just said that there is an animal without vertebrae in Hanwuji

1315
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
In fact, it was almost 9:10 at night.

1316
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
when plants appear

1317
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's actually been almost 11 years since now

1318
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
last less than an hour

1319
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,120
Turret just showed up

1320
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,720
and then in the last three minutes

1321
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,880
not our kind

1322
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,600
If humans related to us appear

1323
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,240
Just like Sun Wukong came out of "Huaguo Mountain"

1324
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,240
Three minutes to make a fuss in the sky

1325
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,560
The earth is messed up

1326
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,200
So if you look at it over such a long time

1327
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,080
If you take a look at this National Geographic magazine,

1328
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,760
Sharks may have lived on Earth for the last year

1329
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,240
Is it right

1330
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,720
So how expensive is the long life

1331
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,760
I often say this to my wife

1332
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:39,600
Is it right

1333
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,680
Then nature has a very long time

1334
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:50,120
I think time is one of its deepest wisdoms

1335
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,280
In other words, on Earth, if there is no time-tested

1336
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,120
even if there is life to speak

1337
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,480
It often skims like we say

1338
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,120
Floating for admissions purposes

1339
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,700
In fact, from the point of view of life

1340
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,500
we can't say it doesn't make sense

1341
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,460
But if it is better

1342
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,500
It's like knowing, like a shooting star

1343
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,700
Of course humans come into this world

1344
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,700
You can see there is a long record

1345
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,460
If there are at least two species of hominids

1346
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,500
One is not the number of people but the number of ancient people, the other is the number of people

1347
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,860
We will compare the number of people as a closer relationship with us

1348
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:29,300
In fact, about 5 million years from now to

1349
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,600
7 million years is the latest data

1350
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,460
Maybe it will change, not necessarily

1351
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,100
Is considered to be the first to break away from the black star

1352
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,500
started to go in the direction of our humans

1353
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,260
The earliest group, but it still belongs to ancient humans

1354
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,800
when the number of people

1355
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:50,500
The first type is probably Renren or Qiaoren

1356
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,300
There are two names to translate it

1357
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,600
Hablas is translated as a capable person by someone, and a clever person by someone else

1358
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,360
The reason is because they can make tools

1359
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,120
But from the perspective of the ancient Yuan

1360
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,560
They already walk on two feet

1361
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,320
It's just that their size, height, in all respects

1362
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,000
Looks like a chimpanzee

1363
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,200
But chimpanzees, beware

1364
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,000
It walks on four legs most of the time

1365
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,720
It must have four legs when it runs

1366
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,000
Occasionally stand up like us

1367
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,200
So from this point of view

1368
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,640
In fact, from the earliest possible

1369
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,360
This place is almost 2 million years old

1370
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,840
Then into Africa's Homo erectus

1371
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,800
Then to Homo erectus in Asia

1372
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,800
This place is almost 800,000 years old

1373
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,560
If we say that the 600,000 to 800,000 people in Beijing

1374
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,920
almost here

1375
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,040
So the tree goes from like this

1376
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,120
You can watch our intelligence in this place

1377
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,440
so this is like

1378
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,640
How do you say it's like a maze

1379
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,000
Go to this place and turn again

1380
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,760
go here to be able to

1381
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,200
I can't get over here

1382
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,960
In fact from this

1383
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
To be able to transfer to our intelligence

1384
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,120
Our nearest neighbors are supposed to be the Leandertas.

1385
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,240
A while ago in Indonesia found a

1386
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
They're about 20,000 away from our time

1387
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
20,000 years is very close

1388
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But another one came out

1389
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Most anthropologists currently believe that

1390
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Not from the same one

1391
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So it's from this one

1392
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
But this is still speculation

1393
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
We are not chief anthropologists

1394
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
but at least we know

1395
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
in over a million years

1396
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
around 1.5 million years ago

1397
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Why do we call him material civilization

1398
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
before dawn

1399
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
because of the time they were created

1400
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
is very clear to see

1401
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
with what we call the hands of others

1402
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Traces of operation knocked out

1403
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Obviously a stone knife like this

1404
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
It can already be used to cut tougher

1405
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
For example, thin skin presses and things like that

1406
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So it's everyone or a coincidence

1407
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
time from now

1408
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
from about 1.5 million years ago

1409
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
over a period of more than two million years

1410
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
That

1411
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,540
It is very important, a kind of personnel that can be used by creatures like humans

1412
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,700
We can also say tool

1413
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,700
The earliest we know we will use is the Beijinger

1414
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,900
Because there are many places in their holes that have been burned

1415
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,500
When we were studying in the early days, it was said that it was about 500,000 years away from now

1416
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:24,600
Judging from the current data, it must be at least 600,000 to 800,000 years old

1417
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:28,600
But when I was studying, many people thought

1418
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:33,400
Beijingers should be Chinese or Chinese

1419
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,600
In particular, the two watersheds should not be the ancestors of the Huangke watershed.

1420
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,800
From the perspective of today's anthropologists, this should not be the case

1421
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:47,000
The vast majority of anthropologists in our world today would believe that

1422
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,600
We flew from the east after several migrations

1423
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,700
not from mainland China

1424
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:55,900
fire is very important

1425
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,100
Because if we use fire, it will probably make us cross the glacier.

1426
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Learn a little about the Ice Age

1427
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
so important to us

1428
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
if you know the history

1429
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
just know why a scientist

1430
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
while looking at things

1431
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Although we are concerned about our future

1432
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Sometimes very cautious and nervous

1433
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
But we won't be easily afraid

1434
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The longest glacier on earth

1435
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
is in the alps

1436
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
In fact, it's been a long time since what I just said

1437
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
2.5 billion years 2.1 billion years

1438
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
200 million years by 41 years

1439
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Evidence of glaciers everywhere

1440
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But within a million years

1441
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
at least 8 times

1442
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
we watch the record

1443
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
This record in the last 1 million years

1444
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
1 million years and 4 billion years

1445
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
that time is very short

1446
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Now scientists only need to go to Greenland

1447
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
or the North Pole

1448
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
find a way to put

1449
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
make a hole

1450
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
beat into the ice

1451
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Also because it has a welling hole layer

1452
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
The ice core can be beaten for several kilometers

1453
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The ice brought up can be analyzed for the

1454
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
dull atmosphere

1455
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
you can know that time

1456
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Atmosphere Water Content Temperature 1 Million Years Ago

1457
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
All kinds of information can be obtained

1458
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
So let's look at the above symbols to see

1459
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
one two three four five six seven eight

1460
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
it has eight stages written on it

1461
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
But I am a little curious why there are two

1462
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Then why didn’t it write this? I don’t quite understand it.

1463
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
But let's take a look at this picture

1464
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Here is the current average temperature

1465
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
This is where there is more ice

1466
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Here is a place with less ice

1467
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So if you go this way, it means the ice age

1468
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
If you go this way, it means that the temperature is rising

1469
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
So this place is closest to us in this ice and period

1470
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
About 15,000 to 30,000 years

1471
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
still a long time, right?

1472
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Because 15,000 years seems very far away from us

1473
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
But it is already the closest ice age to us

1474
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
The one farther away from us in a million years

1475
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Like this seven million to here

1476
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
There should be an ice age of 7.5 million

1477
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,760
Then around 600,000 years ago

1478
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,380
So we just said the era of Beijingers

1479
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:06,800
such a big ice age

1480
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,840
You see it's a million years old

1481
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:13,040
The record ice chess looks the coldest

1482
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,240
The stage where the temperature drops the most

1483
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,160
So if you don't know how to use fire like them

1484
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,760
even with fire

1485
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,360
To survive such a long ice age

1486
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,360
within 100,000 years

1487
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,560
You see, this period of time is 100,000 years

1488
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,760
Not 100,000 years, at least 50,000 years

1489
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,480
can you make it through

1490
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,880
i think it's not that easy

1491
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,480
Our most recent one lasted almost 15,000 years

1492
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,080
It's been a rare time

1493
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,360
survive this period of time

1494
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,560
The rest of the time you see on average every about 100,000 years

1495
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,960
Just a very big ice age

1496
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,280
So everyone's been talking

1497
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,480
There are also people who are arguing

1498
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,160
Maybe a new ice age is coming

1499
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,880
But before the ice age came

1500
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,400
We're Already Worrying About Our CO2

1501
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,400
will make us very short time

1502
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The temperature drops further

1503
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
If you go further down, you will break through

1504
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
The point where the temperature rises the most

1505
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So in this potential lens

1506
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
is something we're very worried about is going to happen

1507
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But what does human beings have to do with this environment?

1508
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
pay attention

1509
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
This is the brain of the black star

1510
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Baby time and adult time

1511
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
When we don't look at Baby

1512
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
look over here

1513
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
as an adult

1514
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
The black star is about 390 cubic centimeters

1515
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Then came the words of everyone

1516
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Almost to close to 500 cm

1517
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
cubic centimeter

1518
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
we human beings are

1519
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
CC over 1300

1520
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So big at least here

1521
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
more than 4 times

1522
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
with this

1523
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
more than 3 times worse

1524
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
you will find

1525
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
when this baby

1526
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
If it is compared to the pelvis of the parent star

1527
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
very small

1528
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
So you probably rarely see

1529
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
When the little black star was born

1530
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
is dystocia

1531
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Almost all natural births

1532
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
came out with one sound

1533
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
But if people are going to be born now

1534
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
If he wants to come out directly

1535
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
you will find the mother's pelvis

1536
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
The horizontal direction is wider

1537
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
The heavier direction is narrower

1538
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
If you're going to use directions like this

1539
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
If you squeeze it out like this

1540
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
very difficult

1541
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
So when a child is born

1542
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
After the miserable

1543
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Turn your head 90 degrees

1544
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
just came out

1545
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
otherwise

1546
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It is very easy to have dystocia

1547
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
So chimpanzees to modern humans

1548
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
this brain

1549
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
has changed a lot

1550
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
This change doesn't look like it's going to do us any good

1551
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
because of dystocia

1552
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
so

1553
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
What is the human brain like?

1554
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
What effect did it have on us

1555
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
take a look

1556
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
we call hominid

1557
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Said that it's not that we only have human beings now

1558
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
but roughly very close

1559
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Modern humans are within the genus Homo

1560
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
one of them is

1561
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Let's see what characteristics he has

1562
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Let's just skip the previous paragraph

1563
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,480
He said that the size of old growth is necessary to grow

1564
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,480
Then our growth curve is weird

1565
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,840
where is the strangeness

1566
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,400
the time our infancy comes out

1567
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,960
Barely survived when born

1568
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,840
If you take a scumbag out and leave it in the wild

1569
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,360
it must not survive

1570
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:22,440
Chimpanzees have a chance

1571
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,480
not ideal

1572
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,160
But when we look at Bambi's words

1573
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,480
It takes about 5 minutes after birth, and it can stand up after 10 minutes

1574
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,160
You can run with your mother

1575
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,520
So the number of biological words

1576
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,320
Probably need the mother to take care of it when it is born

1577
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,640
This is the characteristic of general martial arts

1578
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,920
Then our childhood was very long

1579
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:44,080
Usually 15 years or older to become an adult

1580
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,080
Because this time will be extended

1581
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,040
Our social structure has also changed

1582
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,040
so all the numbers

1583
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,320
usually a matriarchal society

1584
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,760
or magnetic society

1585
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,600
It is usually several magnetic entities

1586
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,000
at the same time

1587
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,400
Take care of one or several babies

1588
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,900
For example, mother and mother's sister

1589
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,400
and take care of her own daughter

1590
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,800
So we can imagine

1591
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,600
Why our current monogamy

1592
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,900
then not

1593
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,100
If you are monogamous and have to take care of children

1594
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,800
especially took care of two three four

1595
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,900
even if one

1596
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,300
if in taiwan

1597
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,000
It's just that there are many parents helping

1598
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,700
otherwise why say

1599
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,500
It's really hard when you have to take care of children.

1600
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,400
You can see this social structure

1601
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,600
It is indeed an opportunity for women to take care of children

1602
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,500
still more

1603
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,700
That's because our tool increases meat wetness enhancement

1604
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,100
So the body can become healthier

1605
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:42,800
Then we will have more adaptable athletic ability

1606
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,900
I think this ability

1607
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,200
Especially in modern times it is called extreme sports, right?

1608
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,900
after being invented

1609
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:51,100
It's really hot

1610
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,800
human beings rely on the brain

1611
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,500
Our athleticism is super

1612
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,100
making tools this is of course

1613
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,500
our most special

1614
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
in all tools

1615
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,500
Lens language and text should be the most special

1616
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,700
I had a chat with Li Yuanshi during the meal just now

1617
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,000
Language is what we are born with

1618
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,500
Words were indeed invented by man

1619
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
same as science

1620
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,000
something invented by everyone

1621
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,300
Usually it is not easy to learn

1622
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,100
so kids

1623
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,200
Especially we can't write Chinese characters well

1624
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,200
Often used to be beaten

1625
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,200
This hope that this teacher and the little

1626
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:30,700
Parents, don't often beat children's palms

1627
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,500
It should not be so easy for every child to learn to write

1628
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,000
Humans actually have a very important stage

1629
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,100
It is an agricultural industry developed in collective life

1630
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,100
I'll talk to you a little more later

1631
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,000
but one important thing

1632
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,200
How we are different from other creatures

1633
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,400
is apart from the human power that we have inherited

1634
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,000
do we have a different part

1635
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,100
the way we live

1636
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:59,500
traits that instill our existence

1637
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,760
different from other creatures

1638
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,680
That's how our culture actually affects us

1639
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,800
Many places may be beyond our nature

1640
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,080
biological nature

1641
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,840
we have just mentioned

1642
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,040
If it is 15,000 to 30,000 years

1643
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,800
It is human beings who have truly set foot on the

1644
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,720
the stage of evolution

1645
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,400
why do we say that

1646
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,560
because during this time

1647
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,040
Neanderthals disappeared from this earth

1648
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,480
About 30,000 years from now

1649
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,720
near

1650
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,360
They entered the ice age with us

1651
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,360
But there is no way out

1652
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,440
Humans in 15,000 years

1653
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,680
after the weather softens

1654
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,560
Finally out of the ice age

1655
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,280
After this turn around, it will be incredible

1656
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,960
Let's take a look at the extent of the impact of this ice age

1657
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,160
The 18 means 18,000 years

1658
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,440
That is, when the Ice Age has not fully receded

1659
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,040
You look at all of Canada and the Great Lakes

1660
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,480
and the north of the United States

1661
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,080
This white area is full of ice lakes

1662
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,600
all covered

1663
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,900
so in

1664
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,600
The closest Ice Age to us

1665
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,100
Between Mainland China and Taiwan

1666
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,300
There is even a phenomenon of connection

1667
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,900
this is understandable

1668
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,100
then say

1669
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,500
this

1670
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,300
It's not just snowing, it's

1671
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,900
Base ice is already in mainland China

1672
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,100
Accumulated to South China

1673
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,600
base ice phenomenon

1674
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,900
It's not absolutely impossible

1675
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,900
in fact

1676
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,300
snow in the south

1677
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,200
base ice maybe

1678
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,700
There is no way the base is so thick

1679
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,800
but you can watch

1680
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,300
Canada

1681
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,400
almost covered in ice

1682
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,300
If we look at the nearest 8000 years from now

1683
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,800
it's already hiding

1684
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:42,300
I went to such a place

1685
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,000
of course

1686
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,100
now everyone is saying

1687
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,200
This block of ice in the Arctic

1688
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,700
are under reduced

1689
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,500
you just know

1690
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,000
why do you think

1691
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,100
very nervous

1692
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,700
good

1693
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,200
pass

1694
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,200
After the Bianhe period, you see, this is 13,000 years

1695
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,700
the reality of human development

1696
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:10,400
Already there are very inverse and surprising tools

1697
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,900
like this is an ancient needle

1698
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:17,000
A needle made from a bone, you can see the meticulousness of its workmanship

1699
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,500
On the surface, this piece seems to be the same as the period when the coincidence just made it

1700
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,700
Stone knives are a little bit similar

1701
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,200
Actually, I'm sorry, it's still not the same

1702
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:30,500
Look at this piece, this is 4500 years

1703
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,600
In 4500, a machine appeared in Dakengkeng, Taiwan

1704
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:39,400
That's where Basian is now

1705
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,300
I'm sorry, it should be the place of Badi

1706
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,700
Already some people's machines have appeared

1707
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,700
A piece of news I heard recently is

1708
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:54,000
Matsu finds a bone that may be 7,000 years old

1709
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,600
that was a little earlier

1710
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,000
You know that we already have colleagues and people in Asia

1711
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
In Mexican words, in 4500 years

1712
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
You see this building is very beautifully done

1713
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
The grinding case of his bones and stones

1714
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
In fact, the 90s have already begun to move towards a new era

1715
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
So let's look ahead a little bit

1716
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
How did our people move forward?

1717
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Here I tell you a story

1718
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
We've reached the point where we're near the end

1719
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I tell you a story

1720
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
In fact the story was National Geographic

1721
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I found it from an article in 2002

1722
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
what he calls a lost civilization

1723
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
But where did it disappear?

1724
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
green sahara hard to imagine

1725
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Why does the Sahara Desert use green to describe him?

1726
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
The whole story happened in 2000

1727
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
At that time there was an archaeologist in Chicago

1728
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
His name is Sireno

1729
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
this person is famous

1730
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Because his discovery has been made into a movie

1731
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
There's at least one movie called "All the Evil"

1732
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Has anyone watched this movie

1733
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
"The Evil Fish Thief"

1734
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
10 times the movie of "Bad Fish" now

1735
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So about the size of a dinosaur

1736
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It was very surprising to find the crocodile in the salad

1737
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
There is also a species of grass dragon found in Nileir

1738
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
This is what he found

1739
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
He just happens to be familiar with that area.

1740
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
That's the Tarzan we'll mention later

1741
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
The Desert We Call Tethered

1742
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
The story actually goes like this

1743
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
when they had an archaeological

1744
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Desert stability 120 degrees

1745
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Fahrenheit of course

1746
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
That's forty degrees now

1747
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
it's amazing temperature

1748
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
They missed the exam for half a month

1749
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
found nothing

1750
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Also encountered bandits in Africa

1751
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
At that time some of them got separated

1752
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
there is a photographer

1753
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
His name is Headware

1754
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
He found some kind-hearted human bones on a sand dune

1755
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Now the words of the Tarzan desert

1756
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
we call it a desert within a desert

1757
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
that is to say

1758
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Almost the driest area

1759
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
what did headware say

1760
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,300
He said it seemed like there was a gust of wind in the desert

1761
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,600
brought us to that place

1762
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,900
let's rest in that place

1763
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,900
But immediately on that side

1764
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,900
He found something very unusual

1765
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,400
In the tools he found the real thing, the building, the axe.

1766
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:16,000
Then the bone he found a lot of bone

1767
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,500
Including Lingyang's scenes of deer and aquatic animals

1768
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,500
Among them are crocodiles, hippos, turtles, and fish sticks.

1769
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,400
Why in the desert in such a dry desert

1770
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:28,100
find something like this

1771
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,400
Includes bones and osteoids

1772
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,400
sirino he is worthy of being an archaeologist

1773
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,000
He is so fine that he is likely to stand in a place where he used to be

1774
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,300
was once a plant

1775
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,400
or at least the biological part

1776
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,300
in fact on the stony ground

1777
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,300
You can still see that there are carvings out

1778
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:51,400
Carved out of this scene is the scene of a deer

1779
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,300
So is there really a lot of creatures in that place?

1780
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:55,700
live in that place

1781
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,400
Okay, let's talk about the Green Desert first.

1782
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,000
In fact, 70,000 years ago

1783
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,600
It's almost our kind of intelligence

1784
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:07,600
Start making one of the most important thousand joys on earth

1785
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:14,000
When we talk about the process of flying from east to east or west to Qianxi

1786
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,600
At that time the salad desert was in fact

1787
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,600
its axis at that time

1788
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,200
70,000 years ago it was actually a desert

1789
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,900
But 12,000 years ago

1790
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,600
its axis actually wobbled a bit

1791
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,700
In other words, after the Ice Age

1792
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,100
12,000 years ago there was a swing

1793
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,800
The wind from Africa during that swing

1794
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,200
suddenly move north

1795
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,500
That is, its rainfall suddenly shifts northward.

1796
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,900
That is to say, many places in the whole area

1797
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,600
There is abundant rainfall

1798
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,100
What is the result of this abundant rainfall?

1799
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,200
You can watch these two pieces

1800
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,800
From this point of view

1801
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,600
We usually like the light yellow area here

1802
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:59,300
the grassland we live in

1803
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,000
this proportional angle

1804
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
If this place is green, like this dark green

1805
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,640
is the rainforest

1806
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,360
Shallower, this place is said to be a grassland

1807
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,200
Now barely

1808
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,040
This place is probably still grass

1809
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,440
This yellow place is all desert

1810
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,880
So we are talking about the area away from the green

1811
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,920
It's this place called Gerborough

1812
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,960
red dot this place

1813
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,240
totally yellow

1814
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,000
so currently it's desert

1815
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,920
70,000 years ago, it was also a desert

1816
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,840
But twelve thousand years ago

1817
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,040
became like this

1818
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,440
that is its place

1819
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,960
turned into a light green area

1820
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,960
That is, a place with grassland

1821
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,720
So in other words the Gerborough area

1822
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,720
In fact, there are green areas that are very dark green.

1823
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,320
not only

1824
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,600
In fact NASA even sent this space shuttle

1825
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,680
Go to the photo taken above

1826
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,480
So the same is in the desert on the desert

1827
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,600
You can see the remains of the river beneath the ground

1828
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,560
so there are very wide rivers

1829
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,600
flow period

1830
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,080
you can see it along the top of the bed

1831
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,120
In fact, some of the river dormitory

1832
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,800
How long ago did this happen

1833
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,500
Back in the desert 3,500 years ago

1834
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,000
so we are now familiar

1835
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,500
The Chinese often say Shahai Shangtian, Shahai Shangtian

1836
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,500
in fact the whole world

1837
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,300
There have been humans on the earth for 3500 years

1838
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,100
then he started drying again

1839
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,800
so what's going on over there

1840
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,300
Let's see in 2005

1841
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,900
he went back to that place

1842
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,000
This time it's not just him

1843
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,500
In fact another named Anna

1844
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,700
go with him

1845
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:32,000
Anna is actually an anthropologist

1846
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,100
when going with him

1847
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:35,500
More human wills found

1848
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,600
found two batches

1849
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,400
it's something special

1850
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,500
These two chains

1851
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,900
one batch of time

1852
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,500
It should be about 4,000 to 6,000 years

1853
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,300
Four thousand years to six thousand years from now

1854
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,500
They probably have mother races

1855
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,600
But another group earlier

1856
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,300
The time is about 8,000 to 10,000 years

1857
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,000
Ten thousand years is a very special number

1858
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,400
their life is not oily wood

1859
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,400
they live by hunting

1860
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,800
So the way of life is very different

1861
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,300
flyers

1862
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,900
That's why it's called the Tyranids

1863
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:12,500
Prayers

1864
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,000
The two times are not the same

1865
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,500
where is the difference

1866
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,000
If it is closer to the present

1867
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,400
If the Tyranids come to see

1868
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,300
they are smaller

1869
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:24,300
The front of the skull is higher

1870
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,900
they can have some funeral things

1871
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:30,500
like this is a volcanic stone

1872
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,800
And some crimes done with hippo bones

1873
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,900
At least they probably ran to

1874
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:39,100
volcanic fields hundreds of miles away

1875
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,100
pick up some jade

1876
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,200
but not sure

1877
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,400
Or trade with others

1878
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,600
still picked it up

1879
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,900
not sure

1880
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,900
but one thing is certain

1881
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,600
their stone kisses

1882
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:55,400
There is already a phenomenon of penning sheep and cattle

1883
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,200
The other is the flyer

1884
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,800
look at their tools

1885
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,000
yes can have

1886
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,900
With a hook, this hook is also very delicate, isn't it?

1887
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,820
I said its time is between 8,000 and 10,000

1888
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:09,260
It's a lot to find and then you can look at its harpoon

1889
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:12,780
It is also done quite delicately, using the current science

1890
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,900
Especially if you look at it with chemical analysis, you can see

1891
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:20,100
Some of their living habits and diseases, for example, judging from their teeth

1892
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:24,600
They've started chewing some crude bone

1893
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,720
Thick bone, not our current Pongalmi

1894
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,200
Obviously those sorghum or some thicker bones

1895
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,600
If most of them are consecutive records, it is difficult to live beyond the age of 40

1896
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,640
From the franc implant of the tooth, a silk isotope can be found

1897
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:48,600
That is, the same digit of the silk margin number, if we do dating analysis

1898
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,840
It can be known that they must drink fresh water

1899
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,680
And fresh water must be available for father to drink

1900
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,360
They don't have to travel very far to tell from their bones

1901
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,100
You will find that anthropology uses many chemical analysis methods

1902
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,800
Bioanalysis can know all the situations of their lives

1903
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,500
Judging from the bones of fish or shellfish they left behind

1904
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,700
They actually caught the Furnace Monster of the Nile

1905
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,800
I don't know what the furnace monster of the Nile didn't know

1906
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,800
You can only see it when you watch a movie in National Geographic magazine recently

1907
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,800
Some fish in the Nile are actually more than a few meters long

1908
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,100
very large fish belonging to the class of furnace fish

1909
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:33,600
Of course it also has other crocodiles and hippos

1910
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,600
These things all go together

1911
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:44,900
I am a little bit moved by the fact that the Chinese say that a gentleman is in the end of the world, but he does not hide his name

1912
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:48,600
But knowing the name sometimes doesn't help

1913
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,700
If you don't know the name, now dig out the bones

1914
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:55,300
After turning over the book, I can clearly see all the days I lived in the past

1915
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,200
You can probably find out anything you've done.

1916
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,100
In the end is a person living

1917
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Is it important for the survival of the group

1918
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Is the process important or the result important?

1919
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
in front of nature

1920
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
the ruthlessness of nature

1921
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
but we are also

1922
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
live by nature

1923
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
so I often feel

1924
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Life is often dependent on nature

1925
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,000
provide opportunity

1926
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But nature does not guarantee us

1927
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
This sentence has been used by me often

1928
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
used in education

1929
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
I think the most important thing about education

1930
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It should be the principal of the school

1931
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Whether it is the director or the teacher

1932
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
should be available to those who study

1933
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Good environment

1934
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
For example, in college

1935
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Principals should be responsible for creating an environment

1936
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Let professors do research well

1937
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
The professor should create a good

1938
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
laboratory environment or classroom environment

1939
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Let students learn well

1940
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So create the environment, create the opportunity

1941
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
but no guarantee

1942
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Because no one after finishing college

1943
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
This life is a life

1944
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
it shouldn't be this kind of thing

1945
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
but take a look

1946
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Qi Feiren

1947
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,760
Why are you still staying in Gerbero in eight thousand years?

1948
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:08,160
But there is no way when Gerbero lives for more than 4,000 years

1949
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:12,560
According to the logic, Gerbero District should have been around 3,500 years ago

1950
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,560
It was turned into a desert area again

1951
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,320
So what kind of environmental changes are they

1952
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,320
making them lose their ability to survive there

1953
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,000
this is a question worth asking

1954
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,200
Some people say that self is also our modern self

1955
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,560
Bing and Zizi

1956
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,120
But we're up to now and we're going to ask one thing

1957
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,520
Why do people who come out of Bing and many

1958
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,720
Everyone's fate is different

1959
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,720
Some feet live longer and some feet live shorter

1960
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,720
For example, this one is Australian

1961
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,960
Australians now know

1962
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,760
Before Europeans moved to Australia more than a hundred years ago

1963
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,720
They've been there for 40,000 years

1964
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,280
For 40,000 years, their lives have not changed much at all.

1965
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,040
Still a hunter's life a gatherer's life

1966
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,040
But more than a hundred years ago

1967
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,440
After the Europeans went in, they completely turned them over

1968
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,460
We may ask why the social shadow of human beings

1969
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,760
It was Europeans who discovered America and Australia

1970
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,560
Not Indians or Australians discovered Europe

1971
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,340
I just mentioned the book by Jerr Diamond

1972
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,720
He said how the fate of mankind actually happened

1973
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:21,080
This book is guns germs and steel

1974
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,520
Should be available now

1975
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,480
It's the textbook I use for my general studies

1976
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,280
he gave me good answers

1977
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,440
A question I started asking around 40

1978
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:34,160
He gave me a lot of good inspiration in this book

1979
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:36,560
So I also introduce to you

1980
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,720
We've just heard about the Inca Empire

1981
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:41,600
Why are there so many glorious ancient civilization empires

1982
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,440
Can't live on in history

1983
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,360
Why the Civilizations of Western Europe Pray Big Today

1984
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,880
Why Western Europe invented science and technology

1985
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,640
Is able to be chased by people all over the world

1986
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,640
See Jerr Diamond mentioned a story

1987
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,800
This story doesn't really need him to tell us.

1988
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,560
Because if we just pay attention to the history of South America

1989
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,840
you can notice a story like this

1990
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:06,400
when the Incas were before the Europeans came in

1991
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,220
It's actually really brilliant

1992
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,280
General Pizarro of Spain

1993
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,080
In fact, when it came to the Inca Empire, it happened to be in

1994
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:17,920
columbus

1995
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,480
Not long after discovering America

1996
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:21,240
1492

1997
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:23,300
in the 16th century

1998
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,840
when pizarro passed by

1999
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,620
On the plateau of Miru

2000
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,960
Cajamarca was actually their Inca capital

2001
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,520
At that time the king was called Atahuapura

2002
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,360
his soldiers

2003
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:36,000
He has eighty thousand soldiers

2004
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,400
He has no soldiers, he only has soldiers because

2005
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,200
no horses in south america

2006
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:41,240
only

2007
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:44,280
camel horses don't really have no horses as we see them now

2008
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,200
Pizarro only brought you can imagine

2009
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,440
more than three hundred people

2010
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,760
Troops

2011
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,880
People of Wuhe

2012
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,440
He splits

2013
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:55,160
62 cavalry plus 106 infantry

2014
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,880
no expense one foot

2015
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,640
Atahuapura

2016
01:26:58,640 --> 01:26:59,880
then they

2017
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:06,000
After Zi De asked for about 60 cubic meters of gold

2018
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
He still killed Atahuapra

2019
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,680
Europeans are brutal

2020
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,640
This war has become irresistible in the end

2021
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:16,800
The Inca Empire will never fight

2022
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,520
So in this book

2023
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:22,560
Jer Diamond mentioned why Europe is like this

2024
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,720
Defeat the Inca Empire

2025
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,120
the whole collapse

2026
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,320
he mentioned something

2027
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:36,760
Since the development of agriculture and wood industry in Mesopotamia in Europe,

2028
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,000
spread to continental Europe

2029
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,080
allowed Europe to have an earlier time

2030
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,720
have a larger population

2031
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:47,480
Developed more effective imperial politics

2032
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:50,960
And their cities are more complex

2033
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,320
Their function is in terms of the government system

2034
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,520
In terms of organizational structure

2035
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:56,520
can be seen from their cities

2036
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,560
Like Rome, for example, you can see that

2037
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,080
very systematic

2038
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Of course this caused their army to be professional

2039
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
technology needs professional

2040
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Craftsmanship requires professionalism

2041
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
All manufacture guns and swords

2042
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And there is the use of steel

2043
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So from these perspectives

2044
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Europe has long been on the tools of civilization

2045
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
great strides

2046
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And the horse batch found in Central Asia

2047
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Make it more than just plowing the fields

2048
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
They are very effective in combat

2049
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
This is something that America doesn't have

2050
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
America's empire is also divided

2051
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
the most serious is

2052
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Germs brought to America by Europeans

2053
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Includes Smallpox and Metu

2054
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
make Europeans fully

2055
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
making South Americans completely immune

2056
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
almost defeated

2057
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
All of a sudden it's just a disease

2058
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
thousands died

2059
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
There are a few other important things

2060
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Including dissemination of text and information

2061
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
and social system

2062
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
manpower against different people

2063
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
and thinking habits are different

2064
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
It shows that when two cultures meet

2065
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Culture may not be good or bad

2066
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
But there are strengths and weaknesses

2067
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
this is reality

2068
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So there are two more important things

2069
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
one is text

2070
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
We just said that the Inca didn't have a very effective script

2071
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
They have language but no writing

2072
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
So actually their history has no foundation.

2073
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Not so in Europe

2074
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
texts and their dissemination of information

2075
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
In fact, they have long since made them socially

2076
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
History, economy, and various systems are already very developed

2077
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So we said why didn't the Indians go to Europe

2078
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
In fact, as Europe entered the Americas,

2079
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
They're past the time of the renaissance

2080
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
all habits of thought

2081
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
We have entered the age of science

2082
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
ok let's see the best

2083
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,340
The last few pictures are done, it's already 90 minutes

2084
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:08,180
You'll find in plants and animals we say agriculture and wood

2085
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:12,860
When this wheat and rice was first made

2086
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:16,380
Wheat was indeed in Mesopotamia 8,500 years ago

2087
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:20,020
In Chinese words, rice is 7500 years old

2088
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:27,020
Then sheep and horses, horses were not domesticated until 3000 years ago in Central Asia

2089
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:30,520
So you'll find that not everywhere

2090
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:34,020
All have good food, all have good farming

2091
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:39,720
There are good sheep herding environments everywhere, or there are flowing horses and sheep everywhere.

2092
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:44,020
Not so of course it can spread

2093
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:48,020
But the environment is not the same everywhere

2094
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:51,520
so what does it enlighten me about at the unit door

2095
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,420
Malthus once said

2096
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:57,920
You actually when the population in your environment increases rapidly

2097
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,420
food around you

2098
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,460
food is about to decrease

2099
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:02,920
After the food is reduced

2100
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,160
The population may not be able to increase very quickly

2101
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,160
So this is actually mutually restrictive

2102
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:09,760
But it may overlook one thing

2103
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,160
After the industrial revolution

2104
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,760
Because mechanical force replaces human power, there is still force

2105
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,760
so the personnel changed

2106
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:21,460
In terms of people we have taken out from the natural world

2107
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:24,560
At that time began to be able to dig a lot of coal

2108
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,160
generate steam and operate the machine

2109
01:31:28,620 --> 01:31:29,920
in this case

2110
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,420
you will find one very important thing

2111
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:35,560
This may be my most critical header video of the day

2112
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,620
A noun called Karen Capacity

2113
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:40,220
What is Karen Capacity?

2114
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:44,060
It's just how many people can an environment support?

2115
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,620
There is no standard answer

2116
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,080
We can ask the same question

2117
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:52,280
How many people can Taiwan's resources support?

2118
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,120
Can support 23 million

2119
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:54,860
No problem at all

2120
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,320
Because we now have 23 million people living here

2121
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:58,080
OK

2122
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,320
That can support 30 million

2123
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
or 50 million

2124
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,000
If there are too few people

2125
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,400
Do we have enough manpower?

2126
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,800
so this is a very important concept

2127
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,800
Malthus made a statement

2128
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,500
He said that if the population exceeds

2129
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,000
If this is the maximum population that can be maintained

2130
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,500
The changes that will occur to the environment

2131
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,600
The population will probably decrease

2132
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:24,000
but he may not have noticed something

2133
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:27,700
The use of personnel will actually change the resource

2134
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,100
we just mentioned

2135
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:32,100
Interchange of personnel and materials

2136
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,300
Actually we are in this world

2137
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,800
by what we just said

2138
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:39,200
Materials produced by different personnel

2139
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,800
It's actually pretty amazing

2140
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,100
In fact, in the second century

2141
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,200
chemist proposes oil industry

2142
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,800
Like this, it's medium oil

2143
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,300
This is probably Liuqing

2144
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,600
This should be the flower oil machine of the sea

2145
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:55,300
You can also see another one from the second century

2146
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,200
nuclear power of course

2147
01:32:57,700 --> 01:32:59,800
This should also be our third nuclear plant

2148
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,260
what does it bring

2149
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,260
Let's look at this population curve

2150
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:07,660
the red one is

2151
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,540
if your death rate is too high

2152
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,040
it can level off quickly

2153
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,700
But if your mortality

2154
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,300
not too high

2155
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:15,900
if it maintains normal growth

2156
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:17,300
rush up soon

2157
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,660
So in terms of heavy axis

2158
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:23,660
Here is almost what we see

2159
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:25,460
this time in this place

2160
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:27,240
We are currently around 2010

2161
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:27,960
almost here

2162
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,120
so the place is about

2163
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:33,720
7 billion people

2164
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,720
It should be 10 billion

2165
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:37,520
So 10 billion down

2166
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,360
90 80 70

2167
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:40,720
around here

2168
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:42,820
So we're probably here

2169
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,220
So many people have been troubled for a while

2170
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,920
where are we going

2171
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,120
probably current economists

2172
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,520
and this human resource to the world

2173
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,620
more familiar

2174
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:55,420
will tell us

2175
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,920
We'll probably go the purple route

2176
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,080
that is likely to go

2177
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,840
In this century, the population will exceed 10 billion

2178
01:34:04,340 --> 01:34:05,860
In fact, based on our record

2179
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:06,860
look at this one

2180
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,600
The current world population exceeded 700 million at the end of last year

2181
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:15,240
in the last century

2182
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,640
In fact, just before the Second World War, it was just over 3 billion

2183
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,940
So the doubling speed is very fast

2184
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,540
The yellow one is to develop the country

2185
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,040
They were in fact during World War II

2186
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,640
The population has started to decline

2187
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:34,360
When will the population of developing countries start to decline?

2188
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:38,400
At least it will start slowly after 2000

2189
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,200
Only then will we start going down from this place

2190
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:44,400
Therefore, the population of developed countries in the world

2191
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,500
as a proportion of the population of developing countries

2192
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,700
In fact, the proportion of developing countries is still very high

2193
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,660
At least as far as the BRIC countries are concerned

2194
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:56,760
BRIC means Brazil, Russia and India and China

2195
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,300
The population of these four countries

2196
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,060
should probably be

2197
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
more than half of the world's population

2198
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
because it was found that a large population

2199
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
he's gonna really start falling

2200
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
in fact it will take a while

2201
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
we said earlier

2202
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
staff may not be adequate

2203
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Based on our current population

2204
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
human lifespan

2205
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
In fact, there are several curves here

2206
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
we can pay attention

2207
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
The most controllable is

2208
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
use of personnel

2209
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
If used in a valid situation

2210
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
immediately have access to your technology

2211
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,000
to control health problems

2212
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
The most important hygiene should be drinking water

2213
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
If drinking water can be controlled

2214
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
your contagious disease

2215
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
if you get it under control

2216
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
You'll see the death rate drop immediately

2217
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
death rate drop

2218
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
The birth rate also fell

2219
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
In fact, after the death rate dropped

2220
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
it's probably closer to ten percent of this place

2221
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
nearest west

2222
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
You can see it doing the second wave of descent

2223
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
what is the disease it wants to control

2224
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
is a chronic disease

2225
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I have this disease too

2226
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
reached a certain age

2227
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,600
Probably neovascular disease and high blood pressure

2228
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,000
Three high questions

2229
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,200
If chronic disease can be controlled

2230
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,400
The death rate can be lowered

2231
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,800
If you put developing and country

2232
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,000
To make a comparison with developing countries

2233
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
in terms of birth rate

2234
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,800
in terms of developing the country

2235
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,000
In fact, in the last century

2236
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,600
You will find that its death rate is already falling

2237
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,600
But if it is a developing country

2238
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,000
Its mortality rate is actually going to this century

2239
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
just started falling from here

2240
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,400
So to represent the population of the world

2241
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,900
Should be walking up for a while

2242
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,700
Probably can't escape until 101

2243
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,900
You will find different country desk

2244
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:53,200
Survival and survival strategies are different

2245
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:57,300
The last few three slides

2246
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:58,800
I will talk about this topic

2247
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,000
because i just said

2248
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,400
Scientists actually look at things with a scope

2249
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:05,900
That is to say, the target of your research

2250
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:10,200
In fact, there must be a specific goal

2251
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:12,500
see things very precisely

2252
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:15,200
But today we also found something

2253
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,800
Just use technology to see things

2254
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,300
Sometimes it may not be enough

2255
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:24,300
Because what we live in this world is as a person

2256
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,400
If you look at things from a human point of view

2257
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:27,800
may be different

2258
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,500
Jerr Diamond he gave me the answer is also good

2259
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,600
problem is good

2260
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,600
that's it

2261
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,200
I list him one by one

2262
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,700
Please take a look with me

2263
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:38,700
He said every civilization and every culture

2264
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:41,600
not necessarily immortal

2265
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:44,000
In fact, this is what we all want

2266
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,300
Chinese culture is very difficult, especially hope

2267
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:50,800
Our children can obey the three rights

2268
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,100
Is it right

2269
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:53,900
Which of us doesn't wish for ourselves

2270
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,600
As long as our children can obey the road and accept the three powers

2271
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,300
But he tells us that every civilization and every civilization

2272
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,760
Every culture may not be immortal

2273
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,460
Not every civilization has been around for a long time

2274
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,820
can be compared from a

2275
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,020
on the face of it

2276
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,480
tools life aspects

2277
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,800
relatively backward

2278
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:17,040
progress will develop

2279
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,200
This does not mean any discrimination

2280
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:22,400
For example, I just said Australia

2281
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,960
With no one competing with him in that place

2282
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,120
Isolated from this world for 40,000 years

2283
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,440
After entering Europe, the whole turnaround

2284
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,520
so not any civilization

2285
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:36,920
They must all go forward in a straight line or a curve.

2286
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,280
not absolute

2287
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,640
Many tools, some difficult and some easy

2288
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,200
It is more difficult as we just said

2289
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,960
It was invented by humans themselves

2290
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,520
For example, it is difficult to say words

2291
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,240
science is hard

2292
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,800
These are not learned by everyone

2293
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,000
So not everyone enters school

2294
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,640
Both exams should have the same high marks

2295
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,560
This is worth every Taiwan

2296
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,520
People who engage in education pay attention

2297
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,900
There are not many opportunities for real innovation in many things

2298
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,900
many manufactured things

2299
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:07,900
Many people learn from others

2300
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,900
did not invent

2301
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:12,900
But there's nothing wrong with learning from others.

2302
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,900
The development of much of our knowledge

2303
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:15,900
many ways of thinking

2304
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:16,900
i just said

2305
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:19,900
Especially when it comes to things like words and science

2306
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,400
Someone invented it first

2307
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:22,900
let's learn

2308
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,900
well-educated and poorly-learned

2309
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:27,900
Depends on our talent and hard work

2310
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,900
But he said something

2311
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,300
Whoever runs first is not necessarily the winner

2312
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,800
Winning now may not always win

2313
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,800
I often say this

2314
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,800
is worth our vigilance

2315
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,800
Whoever runs first doesn't necessarily win.

2316
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,800
because if you look at

2317
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,800
The earliest places where agriculture developed

2318
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,300
Youwa language

2319
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:49,800
messed up now

2320
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,800
If it weren't for the private oil produced elsewhere

2321
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,800
Hold on to other places first

2322
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,800
The situation in the Middle East lives in many places

2323
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,800
Of course he also has

2324
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,800
very rich people there

2325
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,700
then you go to africa

2326
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:05,840
Africa is not the best place to live

2327
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,500
In fact, the most starved to death every day is also in Africa

2328
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:12,920
Those who win now may not always win

2329
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:17,880
Of course, the current winners may also become losers.

2330
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:22,280
But those who destroy their own resources are always the losers

2331
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:26,120
Because civilizations that disappeared like this have already appeared on the earth several times

2332
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:30,120
That's what I just said maybe this paragraph

2333
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:33,120
The most important sentence at the beginning of today's speech

2334
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:37,120
Once any kind of life is developed

2335
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,120
When breaking through the technical civilization of carrying capacity

2336
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:43,120
may have to accept the challenge of a personnel crisis

2337
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:48,120
In other words, when we have developed such a sophisticated technology

2338
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:52,120
we need enough people and supplies

2339
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:56,120
to support the increased population we need

2340
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:58,120
and the technologies we develop

2341
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:59,120
it's necessary

2342
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,100
But have we noticed what we consume

2343
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,200
there is no chance to fill

2344
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,700
Probably everyone in Taiwan should notice

2345
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,200
We have exhausted the resources of our descendants

2346
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,900
An Evolutionary Perspective Head of Nature

2347
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:27,400
Humans are not the center of this natural world most of the time

2348
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:30,800
Will we be the center of the world in the future?

2349
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,700
Not necessarily, right?

2350
01:41:33,500 --> 01:41:37,600
The emergence of humans may be an accident of nature on earth

2351
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,800
Evolution does not have a definite direction

2352
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,900
Maybe we just took an opportunity

2353
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:47,300
If we look at our current human beings in this world

2354
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:49,600
Its time is actually only tens of thousands of years

2355
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,100
We have evidence to back our time up to only a few tens of thousands of years

2356
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,700
There is a natural law, a biological context, and an environmental context

2357
01:41:58,800 --> 01:41:59,800
it has a background

2358
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,140
brought us to where we are today

2359
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,200
can we think about it

2360
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:12,160
When biological evolution has no way to move forward effectively

2361
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,720
Changes in our environment and changes in our culture

2362
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,440
Is it when we live in this world

2363
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,160
special attention should be paid

2364
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,600
In other words how do we live

2365
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,240
and how the people around us live

2366
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,720
Should it become the focus of our thinking?

2367
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:33,600
Of course, this is what I often tell my students in class

2368
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,720
Now that we have stood on this stage of nature

2369
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,520
after thinking about it

2370
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,120
And thinking about the manpower of tomorrow

2371
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:43,800
So should we be responsible for tomorrow?

2372
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:46,240
Responsible for the environment and culture

2373
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,080
A lot of questions were when Jerr Diamond read that book

2374
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,040
I'm asking

2375
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,880
How can life on earth last forever?

2376
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,960
what kind of environment to live in

2377
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:58,920
What kind of environment do we live in?

2378
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,040
what are we

2379
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,200
what kind of creature is it

2380
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:04,320
You will find that if other creatures

2381
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:08,840
For example, a goldfish that landed in the Pacific Ocean

2382
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,840
Did he know he was near an island

2383
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,320
or near the west coast of a Pacific Ocean

2384
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:17,000
probably not

2385
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,080
But we are concerned about our environment

2386
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,760
can be very clear

2387
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,200
we now know more and more

2388
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,520
what kind of creatures are we

2389
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:25,440
our surroundings

2390
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,960
I know more and more where the same

2391
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:30,240
Where is the difference

2392
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:35,000
Our Taiwan can live such a good life

2393
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,600
what can we do

2394
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:38,880
Why can we communicate with many advanced countries

2395
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:43,560
Enjoy the relative advantages and disadvantages of material life

2396
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:46,120
What exactly is collective intelligence?

2397
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:49,200
can we see our future

2398
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:51,960
When I was designing my own general education course

2399
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,600
In fact, many things about Taiwan

2400
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,280
i don't have an answer

2401
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:00,000
But I guess it's all of us

2402
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,440
Let's plan together how we will go in the future

2403
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:05,840
it may not have a certain right and wrong

2404
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,960
But as long as we all agree

2405
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:09,760
What direction should we go

2406
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,640
For example, Taiwan has no personnel

2407
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:14,720
Then do we want to increase the price or not?

2408
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,640
if no price increase

2409
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,840
how do we use our people

2410
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,080
Then we don't lack water resources

2411
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:23,000
Most of the water on our mountains now

2412
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,760
Once down, it will flow to Hainan.

2413
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:27,000
How do we use our water resources

2414
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,800
be used with caution

2415
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:29,880
i think these things

2416
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,000
It's not absolutely right or wrong

2417
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,320
But maybe we have to find it together

2418
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:36,760
way of living together

2419
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:37,880
ok thank you all

2420
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,920
I see you need some water

2421
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,680
ok the rest of the time i think

2422
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:55,320
asked a lot of questions

2423
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,400
Some secretly suggested that I have no answer

2424
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:59,960
so do it again

2425
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,160
Any questions or comments welcome

2426
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Thank you Professor Chen Zhuting for your speech

2427
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,500
I heard and learned a lot

2428
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,700
Just mentioned that there are 23 million people in Taiwan

2429
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,000
We should have enough food now

2430
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Because it can feed so many people

2431
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,400
If there are more in the future, it may not be enough.

2432
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,000
In fact, our food shortage in Taiwan is serious

2433
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,300
Because our autonomy is only 32%

2434
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:49,700
Most are imported

2435
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:50,500
if not imported

2436
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:52,400
We can't actually live that many people

2437
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,000
something went wrong

2438
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,100
The energy part is

2439
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:58,800
I think we should really save

2440
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,100
what should be raised

2441
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,960
both but perhaps more importantly

2442
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:05,600
We should develop the energy of the future

2443
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:06,800
R & D technology

2444
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,560
How about in the future there will be

2445
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,400
That is to say, there are technologies available to others

2446
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:15,800
and then get energy harvested elsewhere

2447
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,000
e.g. priesthood energy

2448
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,660
that may be my new technology

2449
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:20,800
technology is then transferred to other countries

2450
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,460
What about getting the first prize in our economy?

2451
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:24,460
similar to this one

2452
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:25,260
that now

2453
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:27,460
More influential when dealing together

2454
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,600
we are now that

2455
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,700
Research and development related to energy in Taiwan

2456
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,060
The money spent is really

2457
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,760
really too little too little

2458
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,800
So this is a bad phenomenon

2459
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:37,500
Then we didn't have oil

2460
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:39,000
That's not much coal

2461
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,860
Other energy natural gas liquids are rare

2462
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:41,860
that is no way

2463
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:43,460
because we don't have that many resources

2464
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:46,160
But our brain power should be able to blossom

2465
01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:47,860
new technologies can be developed

2466
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,700
This is our hope for the future

2467
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:52,500
But this aspect is obviously less thoughtful.

2468
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:57,400
probably should have said

2469
01:46:57,400 --> 01:47:00,360
We are now 2300

2470
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Three million people live as if we have enough resources

2471
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I don't look too worried

2472
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Although most people talked about what fuel and electricity will increase

2473
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
everyone get nervous

2474
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:17,000
But in the way of life, it seems that there is no shortage of resources

2475
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
This is actually

2476
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:23,000
No, Taiwan is really

2477
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Often when an idea comes up

2478
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
There are actually many different voices, right?

2479
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
we all know a lot

2480
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
So in terms of social decision-making

2481
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,000
There are many places where there are actually bottlenecks

2482
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
In terms of planning

2483
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I often say three words

2484
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Also for the board of education

2485
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I said there are a lot of talents in Taiwan

2486
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
few teams

2487
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Then there are a lot of jobs in Taiwan

2488
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
but few ideas

2489
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Taiwan has many plans

2490
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
This is for us probably

2491
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
This research unit

2492
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
But the cumulative effect is little

2493
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So it seems that nothing has changed and accumulated like this

2494
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
a more collective common wisdom

2495
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,420
Might be when I'm thinking about this aspect of the speech

2496
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:09,920
An idea that is always in my heart

2497
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,420
no absolute answer

2498
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:17,120
But we are in a relatively negative cycle

2499
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,760
when jumping out of the vortex

2500
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:23,060
Sometimes I feel a little weak

2501
01:48:23,060 --> 01:48:26,100
But it seems that we really want to be together

2502
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,360
especially us

2503
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,260
I think our academia may

2504
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:30,260
should do something more

2505
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,960
too broad

2506
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
However, the average human being is also very flexible.

2507
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,000
So can withstand pressure

2508
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:10,200
Can't beat the whole civilization

2509
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,200
just like loss

2510
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:22,300
But actually another thing

2511
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:25,400
It's you, the whole world is 7 billion

2512
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,600
But only about 1% of people

2513
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,400
may want to use or his resources

2514
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,400
maybe more than 90%

2515
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:37,600
It's a very balanced

2516
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:41,200
so you say carrying capacity

2517
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:44,400
what is this place called

2518
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,000
weight ratio

2519
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,400
an african man

2520
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:51,000
resources consumed by him

2521
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,500
resources consumed by a civilized nation

2522
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:56,800
It's very different

2523
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,800
Saved people after a long time

2524
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,600
What percentage of the world's talent is the United States

2525
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:06,360
But the energy he consumes may be 670 percent

2526
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:08,160
seems to be usually capable

2527
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:11,640
I feel free to take other people's things first and use them.

2528
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:14,240
this may change

2529
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:28,560
hello mr chen

2530
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,960
so i want to ask

2531
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:33,400
Because this topic is about sustainable civilization

2532
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:34,960
sustainable civilization

2533
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,360
Then I want to ask

2534
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:41,560
As for Mr. Chen's vision for both energy and human beings

2535
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:44,060
maybe not to the whole world

2536
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:46,860
At least in Taiwan about energy

2537
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:53,060
or about our entire vision of using energy or matter

2538
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:55,560
Then I would like to ask Professor Chen

2539
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:56,160
Thanks

2540
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:59,160
with just

2541
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,600
the same as the one mentioned

2542
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:05,400
In fact, some things have no definite answer

2543
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,200
but in the race

2544
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,300
For example, new personnel and new materials

2545
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,800
currently running

2546
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:16,400
Is that the person in the immediate situation

2547
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:17,400
find the answer

2548
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:21,100
Then solve it more effectively

2549
01:51:21,100 --> 01:51:22,400
For example, how much

2550
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,000
How many problems are solved

2551
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,100
This is actually in a situation where there is no standard answer

2552
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:32,400
side by side

2553
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:38,800
For example, in terms of banning people in Taiwan,

2554
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:44,600
Most experts don't think that's an effective solution to the problem

2555
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:50,000
How many percent can the Sun people solve?

2556
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
seems to have an estimate

2557
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,400
But after we made the Taiwan Sunman version,

2558
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,700
Most of them are exported

2559
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:58,700
I'm useless

2560
01:51:58,700 --> 01:52:00,000
The reason is to cooperate

2561
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Technology didn't play well together

2562
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,500
Then under the condition of relatively high price

2563
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,500
At least not currently

2564
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,500
Taiwan does not use much solar energy

2565
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:11,500
Most of them are exported to other places

2566
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,500
Especially in Europe, we export a lot

2567
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,500
Like this thing actually it

2568
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:19,500
Of course there are possible solutions

2569
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:22,000
The most direct one is

2570
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Should Taiwan Confront Nuclear Energy?

2571
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,500
Then this one takes the lead in our entire social hierarchy

2572
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,500
is a knotted problem

2573
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,500
There is currently no good solution

2574
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,500
so i say something like this

2575
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:36,500
It's a lot like our own life sometimes

2576
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,500
You sometimes have to face making a decision

2577
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:41,500
then it may be a painful decision

2578
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:44,500
may be take it or leave it

2579
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:45,500
can be a decision

2580
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,500
But it's at least a decision

2581
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,500
Then we sometimes make this kind of decision in life.

2582
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:52,500
After doing it, I will continue to move forward

2583
01:52:52,500 --> 01:52:56,500
Instead of just stopping at one location

2584
01:52:56,500 --> 01:53:00,500
Then everyone seems to be arguing

2585
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
That's the material

2586
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I think from the perspective of my chemistry

2587
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
We have a lot of resources that can be used for new creations

2588
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I think it's cute

2589
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
People are more critical in terms of technology

2590
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
I dare not speak directly

2591
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,000
For example, let’s talk about a few more likely to be compatible with our hopes.

2592
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Is it right?

2593
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Available before 2050

2594
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Seems like a big question mark so far

2595
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
If it cannot be developed effectively before 2050

2596
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Opportunity to express

2597
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
the one that cost a lot of money

2598
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
And not all countries can't use it

2599
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Is it forcing some countries to engage in nuclear fission?

2600
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Taiwan must at least import oil

2601
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
So this probably won't work

2602
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
We don't have such personnel here

2603
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So maybe you need to think about it this way

2604
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
The other BIOMASS now

2605
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,500
It also involves arguing about whether food should be used in this way

2606
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:09,500
So I think this kind of thing needs to be done to make a clarification.

2607
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:15,500
Why did I emphasize on seeing things from the perspective of science majors?

2608
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:19,000
Seeing things differently from a non-scientific perspective

2609
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
But it's not the same. If you use the opposite

2610
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
a lot of trouble

2611
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
But if it is used to talk about it

2612
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I think maybe we can find some ways to improve

2613
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I'm a little bit more optimistic about resources than people

2614
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Because the resource actually should be full on Earth in some way

2615
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:43,000
You can use time in exchange for conditioning

2616
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
The words of the staff are not enough

2617
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Immediately the industry is like Taiwan's industry, it should be affected immediately

2618
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I believe that economy will be affected immediately

2619
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Of course, there is a problem involved here, that is,

2620
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
What kind of economic indicators should Taiwan use?

2621
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,760
to plan for growth

2622
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:06,400
So what is the problem

2623
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:08,840
should or should not

2624
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,680
It also apparently has a different answer

2625
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:14,060
some people think that means

2626
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:15,220
If there is no economic growth

2627
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:16,980
How can we live a better life

2628
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,420
But the economy is doing better

2629
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:21,920
Is everyone sure

2630
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:24,200
an ideal society

2631
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:25,200
I'm not sure either

2632
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:28,380
So questions like this are usually on the table in Taiwan

2633
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,780
less people talk about it

2634
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:34,900
Your question may not be able to be provided by me alone

2635
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:38,160
I can tell you simply

2636
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:42,960
From the perspective of certain money-paying technologies of science

2637
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:46,280
We need to be on certain material resources

2638
01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:47,960
to move forward

2639
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,240
Advanced technology takes a few more steps

2640
01:55:51,640 --> 01:55:52,320
still have a chance

2641
01:55:52,600 --> 01:55:53,360
this is no problem

2642
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:54,840
I dare not speak

2643
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:56,480
I don't know if Teacher Wang treats the personnel right?

2644
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:57,680
is there any way

2645
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:00,000
There may be some more here

2646
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
This expert may have a better answer than me

2647
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,000
I will compare

2648
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,500
I think it's almost time

2649
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:15,800
we are very happy today

2650
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,800
Professor Chen gave us a very

2651
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:21,500
widely

2652
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:26,400
Then it also caused everyone to go back and think about it.

2653
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,300
some problems

2654
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,200
ok thank you very much

2655
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:31,100
Thank you Professor Chen

2656
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:31,800
thank you all

2657
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:32,900
thank you very much
