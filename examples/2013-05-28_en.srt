1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
Keep the tape going until it's built all the way to the starting point by

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,160
finish thebarsr that had been formatted before.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,260
Then dig some more, and build in some really nice things that are ready earned.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,320
Those float doors will create some similar architecture to this little corner.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:25,000
I used to work on p Putin's writers by six hundred when the lights lights went out.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,020
Now the talent activated will help the comments that more people were buying,

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:39,140
Now Āijhāmāsāka must be built in WWanjatana

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:50,260
Āijhāmāsaka should be created in WWanjatana

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good evening, gentlemen, hello, everyone

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's great to have so many people listening to us today

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A speech by Hong Sang-sung, a specific researcher

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
First let me briefly introduce his background

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Shang Chenghe is actually from Qigu Township, Tainan County

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A child who grew up in the countryside

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But he didn't study well

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He later entered the Chemistry Department of Qingda University

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
After 1 month at a very young age

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Received a Ph.D. from Qingda University before the age of 30

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
very impressive

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He is Professor Liao Juncheng of Qingda University

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Also a beneficiary student of Professor Guan Bijun

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
After he got his Ph.D.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Received the Ministry of Education's postdoctoral study abroad scholarship

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sweeps and Pengshui in the United States, our Zhongnanjun Institute

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The current President of the Hong Kong Council

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Three years of postdoctoral research

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Then when he comes back

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Consistently excellent research performance

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
upper he actually

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The main focus of his research

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It is in the part of Tang Chemistry and Tang Biology

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Then he is in these special

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
on the cell membrane

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The analysis of these bullets

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
quite accomplished

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We published his reading in

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
our people in science

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If there is an article published in a natural journal

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that's a shame

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
that upper he has this one

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Nature

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And Nature Chemistry

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
is Nature Journal

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Journal of Natural Chemistry

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and the Journal of the American Chemical Society

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This very important chanting

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Of course his research is very good

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Of course it's the winning document

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The public health label I just told him about

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
he got this congressional

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Academic Awards of the Ministry of Education

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And our former dean

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Brilliant talent machine driven

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Distinguished Talent Award

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,680
And won the TECO Award

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,740
There is also the Contribution Award for Li Tiande's medical achievements

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,640
So in terms of research

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,640
The upper level is quite outstanding

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,840
he got it very young

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,740
This is the chairperson of the Congress

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,700
Zhu Jingyi's words

62
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,640
It is said that the medals filled with film on the body are like this

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,800
but one important thing

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,640
In addition to doing a good job in his research

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,080
He is also enthusiastic about teaching

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
He interacts well with students

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
So he got Tsinghua University

68
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,840
this outstanding teacher

69
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,080
quite difficult

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,480
So we specially invite him to give a speech to you today.

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,280
because he is a good speaker

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,480
He will introduce to you today

73
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,580
This parishioner

74
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,680
he will tell everyone

75
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,980
This hall of wisdom

76
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,280
With you Zhitang's Tang

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,380
why is it different

78
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,580
Then tell everyone what is called

79
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,680
Bangtang Shuangtang Guatang Genduotang

80
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,980
In this part, we often hear some

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
related health food and some

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Some proteins related to sugar, etc.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It is very specialized in this research on the structure of sugar

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and it also participates in the

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
These analyzes of the structure of this glycoprotein

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and the analysis of the functions of these proteins in relation to sugars and sugars

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Recently in our genome center

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We are under the leadership of the University's Dean Au

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We started to make sugar-based vaccines against cancer

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Everyone has said that vaccines are used to prevent infectious diseases

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But we can now use this sugar-based

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to target such a vaccine to treat cancer

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
this is something new

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So you don't need to come here today

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Can get a lot of scientific knowledge

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But the upper layer, apart from being a good scientist

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's also usually a good scientist

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,340
After a very high level

99
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,040
Science and art can probably be combined

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,500
So he ended up telling us

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,340
What kind of connection does Tanggen axion have?

102
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,940
really delicate thing

103
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,340
So we are very happy to have such a rich theme today

104
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,640
You can come and listen to the introduction given by the upper level

105
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,240
We'll have 30 minutes of Q&A later

106
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,240
So guys we're going to let the red-specific researcher

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,040
finish all first

108
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,140
That's a problem, we'll ask it later

109
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,140
ok, here we are again thanking the upper echelons

110
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,840
to give this wonderful speech

111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,940
let us welcome him with a round of applause

112
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,740
good

113
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,640
Thanks

114
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,140
First of all, thanks to Vice President Chen

115
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,240
my last introduction

116
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,240
Thank you for the experience here

117
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,240
feel honored today

118
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Can be invited by Vice President Chen

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Then I'm here to tell you about sugar

120
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,800
to be honest

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Because what I asked before were all scientific articles

122
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,400
scientific stuff

123
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Today I'm going to talk about popular science

124
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000
it took a lot of time

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,800
prepare again

126
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Otherwise I'm actually giving myself a challenge

127
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
that is often

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
on the sugar side

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,800
is often asked

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,800
It is the sugar next to the word and the sugar next to the word

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
what's the difference

132
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
what's going on

133
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Then the content of my speech today

134
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
roughly divided into seven parts

135
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I mean, in the dipping medicine you got

136
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
The last paragraph has seven parts that are

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I will introduce you to this place

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
at the beginning

139
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
First, let me introduce to you that there are sugar and heels next to the words.

140
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,800
A general introduction to sugar next to the five characters

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
that first of all

142
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,800
There is a definition of sugar next to the word

143
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Then you can know that

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,460
sugar is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen

145
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,240
its molecule is

146
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,320
That is Cm, H2O, N

147
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,500
N can be equal or unequal

148
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Then here you can see that

149
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,240
In fact, the ratio of the number of hydrogens to oxygens

150
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,960
exactly like your water

151
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,120
so we just call it carbohydrates

152
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
like this

153
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,620
It is this carbon and this water

154
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
that's on the english side

155
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,540
In English, we call it Cup Hydrate

156
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,000
Then this Cup Hydrate

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You have to take a closer look

158
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Because carbon in English is Cup N

159
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,380
The water is Hydrate

160
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,380
But the combination of these two words

161
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,040
Remove an N in the middle

162
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,820
So everyone, please write the English word Cup Hydrate

163
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,500
You don't write Cup N Hydrate

164
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
One more N is wrong

165
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,000
This is the possible name of Cod N

166
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,080
Then there is another alias

167
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,580
This is the one that can also be called Sugar

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is the name of the wise life

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
sugar classification

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Basically they all have sugar can see

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
one is monosaccharide

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
that's a candy

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
are some of our common

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
From Five Tangs or Six Tangs

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
are some simple sugars

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
A disaccharide is two monosaccharides joined together

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
three to nine sugar

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
we call it fructose

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is a translation of the Chinese translation

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
if polysaccharide

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
more than ten polysaccharides

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
we call it polysaccharide

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In addition there is

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
real sugar

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's practice layers of sugar

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
then a line like

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
this form of sugar

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Most require two or more

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Another one is

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Apart from this appearance

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It also has this policy

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So this is more than a general biomolecule

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
more complicated

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We all know that the river is dry and sour

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
one hair straight face

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If it is a half-white paper, it is also an ecological face.

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But the sugar is different, the sugar is the same

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
it can, the side can be long

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And sometimes it's not long and not just one

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
can be long

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is a bit more complicated

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The difference with this sugar is here

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Generally speaking, if there is sugar in this category, we place

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
All carbon chiral compounds

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If we put on the carbon hand compound

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's talk about this sugar

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
probably can't be wrong

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So this time carbs are using it to succeed

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So include things like steel sugar, starch, cellulose

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Or soaked polysaccharide extraction, etc.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
These are sugars with this

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The sugar dipped in sugar refers to some sweet sugar

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
such as glucose, fructose, maltose

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's just call it dipped sugar

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that's because making sugar

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We will all pour some sugar is 300 lots

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
does this have something to do with it

218
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,100
then you go directly to see

219
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,600
We usually cannot find the word sugar in water

220
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,500
really can't find

221
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,200
to see later

222
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,100
just found out

223
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,600
The word sugar was invented by Shiguo in the Five Dynasties

224
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,200
So in the early years of the book

225
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,800
The annotation in the management is called fish wild

226
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,900
so this makes sense

227
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,000
So if you are in the sugar is in the sea water

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
If you see the word sugar

229
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,800
that's strange

230
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
just very

231
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
It is the invention of the word

232
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,700
When you talk about sugar, you will think of this sugar

233
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,600
So this candy is in Taiwan

234
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,100
It is a very important industry in the early days

235
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,100
So this used to be our Taiwan government

236
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,300
a big layoff

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,400
then here you will see

238
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,900
Here is a photo I found from two steps

239
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,000
very old

240
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
So the face-to-face words at that time

241
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
from the right side

242
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,000
that this is the first

243
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,400
it's factory

244
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,500
it's about this

245
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,900
Use this dry test to help raw materials

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,500
So think of this sugar factory

247
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
This part reminds me of my old hometown

248
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,000
I live in Qigu Township, Tainan County

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The part of Naqigu Township near the sea is Sunyan

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but come in a little more

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just go home and get to the West Dome side

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,500
It's all kind of dry

253
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
it was like this at that time

254
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
so then will

255
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
From small to large

256
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
grew up in this field

257
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Because the mother is the employee

258
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
So what I miss most at that time

259
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
If you say that everyone has gone to Yanqi Valley and Yanshan

260
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
The one that I miss the most is

261
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
his evening

262
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,500
That sunset is really beautiful

263
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
At night, you can really see the sky full of stars.

264
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
because you can see it's flat

265
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
As far as the eye can see

266
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
It is more difficult in Taipei now

267
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
The other one is New Years

268
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
This Taipei Qigu Township

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
like a lot of private breasts

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,680
That private breast is actually the best private breast

271
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,680
It's about 8-12 taels

272
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
you don't buy that

273
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Don't buy the one that weighs more than one catty

274
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,960
Anything over a catty is too old.

275
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,760
but now it's different

276
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,600
Now they are selling big

277
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
when we raised

278
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,560
This is about 8-12 taels, the most tender and delicious

279
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,000
Otherwise, you can still enjoy

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,080
that black skin milk

281
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,520
This is a special product of the seven-inch incense

282
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,000
So I thought Qigu came from Yantian

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That is to plant these fields

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Then this former classmate has

285
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,520
Parents need to show up at this job

286
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,120
So everyone knew

287
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
many little trains

288
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Then pull the cane

289
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,840
Then I went to steal sugarcane and eat it

290
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,120
So many people have this experience

291
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,880
Then you see here, that is to say

292
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,920
Zhuzhi Pond in Taiwan

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,800
It describes the Zhetian

294
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,300
So you can see Zhetian Luanqin B77

295
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,200
I think you'll see it's all turquoise

296
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,700
big and wide

297
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,300
Several kilometers, tens of thousands of hectares

298
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,800
Zhetian

299
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
People along the way call it Green Mud Mud

300
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
This is because everyone, after growing up

301
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,400
There's everything in this dry field

302
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,700
what has the most snakes

303
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,600
Mouse, all of these are in it

304
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,100
And this one is because it looks east and west

305
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,300
If it gets mixed in, it will be like Ming Geng

306
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
just be careful

307
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,100
So every time you harvest

308
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,600
I also saw that many creatures ran out of the machine in the past

309
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Then this bundler B7 talks about Brin

310
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,100
Only save this page to think about the stars

311
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,900
That of course took the dry parts

312
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,300
This page is probably for these women

313
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,600
So these are trendy things

314
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
Of course now

315
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,600
Your guides have been talking about

316
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,300
life and death woman

317
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,000
So actually let these Zhetian

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,840
These confinement oils may now be converted to storage

319
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,400
This is some recent development

320
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,720
Then of course this candy because we

321
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,040
have been inseparable from the relationship

322
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,340
Because Taiwan has been selling sugar

323
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,680
So a lot of sugar is added to a lot of these foods

324
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,740
So you can see something like

325
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,320
candy biscuit pastry or soda

326
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,860
these are

327
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,640
Can't get rid of sugar

328
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,300
about two months ago

329
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,360
It was reported in the newspaper

330
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,660
United States This is the latest study in the United States

331
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,000
It states that there are approximately 180,000 people worldwide

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,760
because

333
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,060
love this sugary drink

334
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,600
and lose their lives

335
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,380
That's mainly because

336
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,440
Get Diabetes Secondary Sex

337
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,740
then this question is

338
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,520
quite serious

339
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,320
that this

340
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,880
me about this drink

341
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,680
like the soda part

342
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,960
you can see

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,320
hard to imagine

344
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,360
I will give you an example

345
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,160
For chemistry this is very good at doing all kinds of different

346
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,120
like this orange soda

347
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,520
Have you all been back?

348
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,240
Fanta

349
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,360
I saw it on a certain website, that is to say

350
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,520
That factory is making Fanta orange soda

351
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,800
I haven't seen it come again

352
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,640
Then it can

353
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,440
Cases of orange soda are sold

354
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,640
this is wesp

355
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,040
If you are interested, you can also see

356
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,920
You just go to the petal material store

357
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,200
then you buy some coloring

358
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,960
buy some fragrance

359
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,880
and then some sugar

360
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,520
We also pay attention to color, fragrance and sweetness when doing research

361
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,240
You almost made this chem soda good

362
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,080
I also brought fragrance here for comparison.

363
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,920
everybody

364
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,640
if interested

365
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,320
you can smell it

366
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
I have bubble tea essence here

367
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,400
Absolutely the same as the black tea you drink

368
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,700
You can't run away if you drink it

369
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,200
The second is the flavor of the meat

370
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
what is the flavor of your meat

371
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,800
It's the instant noodles you eat

372
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,600
Instant noodles are not beef noodles

373
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,900
What instant noodles, those meaty ones

374
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,000
everything is your taste

375
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,200
Then there are strawberries, don't you know?

376
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,800
strawberry is your parent a lot of strawberry flavor

377
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,500
There's also strawberry flavor here

378
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,600
depends on what flavor you want

379
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,500
we chemists can

380
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
then give me some

381
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,700
what are you happy about

382
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,200
Glad that many things belong to chemistry

383
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,900
It's actually not good for your body

384
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,200
So here is to remind everyone

385
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,200
because these should drink less

386
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,500
Because I'm afraid of polluting the site

387
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,600
because of this essence

388
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,300
Once I open it up

389
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Maybe you'll smell it later

390
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,600
great taste

391
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,100
if you are interested

392
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,900
interested in

393
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
include end wanted

394
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,200
If you look at it

395
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
welcome to the front

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So when it comes to this candy, we will often encounter it.

397
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yi'er's businessman Tang, he would rather buy that candy

398
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Then he will want to find some sugar substitutes, so

399
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The most commonly used sugar substitute is this saccharin

400
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So far, the problem with saccharin is that some people still say it’s OK.

401
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Some people say that it will come by itself, but there is still no one who is sure about this thing

402
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The other one that everyone often encounters is Aspatine

403
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Aspatine is a bipectide, which is a biecological sugar

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's actually an Aspatidase

405
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This is Fanning Ammon

406
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So it's a two amino acid glued together

407
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But the point is here, the point is this

408
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There's a methyl here, so it's a fat rib

409
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It is a fatty rib, the methyl, the fatty rib

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,920
So after our body decomposes

411
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,000
i want to hear something

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
false lips

413
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,800
Because this hydrolysis is to get false lips

414
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,000
Then this false lip will be very bad for our body

415
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,800
for example eyes

416
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Many people who drink fake alcohol suffer from insomnia

417
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So this is not good for long-term use

418
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So if you get a chance to go out and buy coffee

419
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you see a text next to it called

420
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
school girl call

421
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
still

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
forgotten

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I forgot

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
this one

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Aspacatin

426
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you must not add

427
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
because the coffee is hot when you add it

428
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
break down faster

429
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
False lips will come out

430
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
so what

431
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
usually someone is talking

432
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What to say about sugar substitutes

433
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Here

434
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I am

435
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
there is a personal suggestion

436
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Does not represent any of my positions

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
My personal because I got it from Wikipedia

438
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
to find

439
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,500
I now have a description of him

440
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,800
everyone to fancy

441
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,700
You can easily buy field bureaus

442
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,200
but very strange

443
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,400
Tianjutang in Taiwan

444
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,600
has not been very hot

445
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
also can not buy

446
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
But what I know about this thing is

447
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,500
I've been through a lot of business interests

448
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,200
In the U.S

449
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,100
It has never let this Tianjutang

450
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
Why did you enter the U.S. market?

451
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,700
Because those who sold the hall have already

452
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,800
the market occupied

453
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
it doesn't want to let it out

454
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,300
Taiwan is following the United States

455
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,800
this is a big problem

456
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,300
so in japan

457
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,200
in south america

458
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
in the mainland

459
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,900
In fact, many of them use Tianjutang

460
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,800
So if you have elders

461
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,300
Then there is the problem of diabetes

462
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,500
then you really crave sugar

463
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,800
My suggestion is that you can buy a field bureau

464
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,700
haven't eaten

465
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,100
that leaf

466
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,300
you take it off and wash it

467
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,600
mouth is very sweet

468
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,900
So the one you really want to eat

469
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
can watch

470
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I just provide it as a reference for you

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
So the above is the first bulk I think

472
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The second part is to introduce to you

473
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
These single or double halls we often see in our life

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Or some introductions of widowed or multiple halls

475
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We often share the same points in this life

476
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
before that

477
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I still want to give you

478
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's the simplest thing about this

479
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Church structure

480
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
have different levels

481
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
some high school, some college

482
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
even the elderly

483
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This is a more professional structure

484
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
generally speaking

485
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Take Pratang's History

486
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There are roughly three ways of expressing

487
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The first one is feature projection

488
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This feature is the professor

489
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
190 Nobel Prizes in Chemistry

490
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He is because of the recognition of the contribution between the halls

491
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's his habit to turn into this form

492
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,740
The other professor is an English professor named Harris

493
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Harris Projection

494
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,240
He is also a major in German

495
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,440
He likes to turn him into such a form

496
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,240
we do chemistry

497
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,940
We like to turn the conversation into something like this

498
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,240
Because of this configuration we know

499
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,740
What kind of position is its replacement actually in?

500
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,740
We will understand its planning

501
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,540
Talk about the half-blank paper we just talked about

502
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Or where is the difference in Ha Giang Sour?

503
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,540
is at this link at this place

504
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,540
Ha Jiang acid uses zero acid radicals to link each sugar

505
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,200
so it doesn't get any stereochemistry

506
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
If it is half white paper it is an ecological piece

507
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,500
It's AMR half-pink minmin

508
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,200
It also doesn't have any stereochemistry

509
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,800
but sugar is different

510
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,300
If you connect this candy with another candy

511
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,460
This place can be down or up

512
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
You link one sugar and you get two Ken's excesses

513
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,600
This is where it gets complicated

514
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,300
What about the second one?

515
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,200
There are several OH positions in one sugar

516
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,000
These positions can have the opportunity to connect with it

517
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,900
Then the sugar with the side chain we just talked about will come like this

518
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,700
Because it's not only half points it can have other

519
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,200
It can even sugar

520
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,900
In that case, the complexity of sugar will be more

521
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,300
So you have to remember that

522
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,300
Downward we call AVA

523
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,700
upward we call beda

524
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,300
This is up and down

525
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,000
This is such a distinction

526
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,900
What about the common lancandy?

527
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,500
One is the opposite side of nucleotide

528
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,500
It's like RNA we call ribose

529
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,100
Then if the oxygen is missing at No. 2

530
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,700
This we call deoxyribose

531
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,100
the building blocks of DNA

532
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,100
Then there is another Wuhan sugar, the most common one is ribose

533
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
Because of this wood, if you take this

534
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,940
This place of Yuhao is restored

535
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
reduced sugar

536
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
This we call xylitol

537
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
Xylitol

538
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,940
then this is

539
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
You often see it in advertisements, right?

540
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,940
you saw that ad

541
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,940
you are surprised

542
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,940
He took the lead in that ad

543
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
a naked head

544
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
Do you have

545
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,940
feel very strange

546
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,940
What does this naked head have to do with this?

547
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,940
Later, just by looking at it, I knew that

548
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
this naked head

549
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
Bare head

550
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
so he

551
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,940
The ad took the lead

552
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,940
come with the bare head

553
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
So everyone feels very

554
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
think this ad

555
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
three very

556
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,940
creativity

557
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
that in addition

558
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,940
common xylose

559
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
The most common is

560
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
like glucose

561
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,940
with glucose

562
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
Everyone

563
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,940
Glucose and Glucose

564
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
now in our body

565
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
are interchangeable

566
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
That swapped this

567
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
So now there is a passing

568
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
after a pro-acidification

569
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,500
it's just the simple fact

570
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,160
Let everyone understand the relationship between these two sugars

571
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Then the location of this place in the future

572
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,160
It can be opened into a full

573
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,160
So we say that glucose is a whole sugar

574
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
just whole sugar

575
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Then this place can balance

576
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Can become a form with two swords and a pure

577
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
and then overflow

578
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,160
So it will become this CO double sword running to the second carbon

579
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,160
At this time, it is called turning into copper sugar

580
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Then when the back is relaxed, it becomes this

581
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
That's fructose

582
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,160
So it can be replaced in this place

583
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,160
So often we might help learn

584
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Speaking of So-Called Whole or Fructose

585
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
It's the difference here

586
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
fructose

587
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Fructose, you can hear fructose clearly, right?

588
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Then you should pay attention

589
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Because this sugar is not only its content

590
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The second thing to look at is its glycemic index

591
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It means how quickly it gets into your blood after you eat it

592
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Resist your sugar concentration

593
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
sugar smaller and faster

594
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So eating jaggery is the fastest

595
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Then we eat instant noodles and rice

596
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Everyone just had dinner, right?

597
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
rice it belongs to this kind of pra sugar that is aggregated

598
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It still needs to be hydrolyzed and made again

599
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So it will be slower if you want that.

600
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So if you say you eat fructose

601
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
we want to separate fructose

602
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If it's real fructose spots like this

603
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Then I can assure you that you will eat it

604
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's about to float and go into the blood vessel.

605
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Therefore, those with a high glycemic index should try to lose weight as much as possible

606
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The other common six-carbon sugar

607
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Except for praline

608
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
This is Pratam

609
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The other is glucosamine

610
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Napra sugar structure

611
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Comparing everyone with Pratam

612
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
There will be a difference in the position of No. 2

613
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It would have been OH light source fine

614
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,960
Now become an NH2

615
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,620
This is called Putang Antang

616
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,040
The other is glucose

617
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,920
It is the place where No. 6 is oxidized

618
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,460
become an acid

619
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,860
Another one is mannose

620
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,600
Mannose is the position of No. 2

621
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
it flips

622
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
originally under

623
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,080
Flip now to top

624
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,720
galactose

625
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,360
this is

626
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,960
For example, the comparison is the position of No. 4

627
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,260
This place was originally under

628
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,380
Flip now to yes up

629
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:31,000
Galactose is the place where 6 minutes of NH2

630
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,300
In addition, this is salt bath sugar

631
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,000
We call it LFVCOS

632
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,740
Another one is Vamos

633
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,200
Vamos We do not have

634
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,240
It is inside the plant

635
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,300
So the sugar candies that I show here

636
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,040
It's all inside the cells of our body

637
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,800
These sugars that appeared

638
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,740
So that is to say

639
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,840
if you want to pass the season

640
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,580
not many seasons

641
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,680
The amount of sugar does not need to be a lot

642
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,300
Just these few are enough

643
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,960
Probably more than 90% reliable

644
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,400
Another candy that I must introduce to you is stinky liquid acid

645
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
This is a nine carbon sugar

646
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,400
The earliest discovery of this smelly acid was from bird's nest

647
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,900
this is bird's nest

648
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,400
Everyone knows the formation of bird's nest, right?

649
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,900
The formation of bird's nest is to use the smelly liquid of swallows

650
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,100
and then to form

651
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
That's because it's the stinky liquid of swallows

652
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,600
So we specifically translated this stinky liquid acid

653
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,000
that's how it came

654
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,500
It was very expensive to buy this smelly liquid acid in the early days

655
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
too expensive to lose to gold

656
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
that is really expensive

657
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,000
That later is now because you can get from that egg

658
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,800
you can go and get this stinky acid

659
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,700
So the price will drop a lot all of a sudden.

660
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,200
So now this thing is cheap

661
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,700
Then everyone can buy

662
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,700
Then I'll talk about this stinky acid in a moment

663
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,000
It's a social special paradise about bird's nest

664
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,500
good

665
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,000
That

666
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The above are monosaccharides

667
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Next, I would like to introduce you to the introduction of disaccharides.

668
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
The most important thing about double sugar is this folding sugar

669
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,000
Nazhe candy is composed of glucose and fructose

670
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,000
disaccharide

671
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,000
Then you speak with justice

672
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
sugar is easier to sugar

673
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
So if you say it’s easy to get sugar

674
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,600
sugar

675
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,500
basically eat less

676
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,000
In addition, maltose

677
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
That maltose is glucose and glucose

678
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,000
Alpha is pointing down

679
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,000
Then E4 link

680
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,500
This disaccharide we call

681
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
maltose

682
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,500
and lactose

683
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,000
Everyone has milk

684
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or the baby drinks this milk

685
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,500
There are galactose and glucose in it

686
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,500
Then it is hit face up

687
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,000
E4 sugar stem chain to link

688
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,140
When we were young or many people may have this lactose hydrolase in the body

689
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,740
So you can successfully hydrolyze this disaccharide

690
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
into galactose and pula sugar

691
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,340
and then use

692
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,920
but with age

693
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,720
like me

694
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,980
lactose water

695
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,040
It's been a long time since I drank

696
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,860
That pair of lactose hydrolase will disappear

697
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,900
What will happen if there is a lack

698
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,280
When this disaccharide goes directly into the water, you will get lactic acid

699
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,880
So you find it convenient and convenient for me to teach a bunch of lactose

700
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,940
why is my stomach growling

701
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,980
Half an hour will start to ask for sports cars

702
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,800
so what about this

703
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,120
Then I showed that no one has this kind of heart

704
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,420
This lactose hydrolase will disappear

705
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,780
Does it have that kind of lactose in foreign countries?

706
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,580
Probably not available in Taiwan

707
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,840
But I will tell you a way

708
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is the only way to die

709
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
What's the meaning

710
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You just drink it, drink it, drink it

711
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Pull again and drink again

712
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
trade your body for its memory

713
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
will guide the lactose hydrolysis membrane to come out again

714
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
then you can drink again

715
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
That's another way

716
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Then I will introduce to you

717
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's when there's a lot of sugar

718
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Then he put the glucose

719
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
to one four one four

720
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
All sugar dry bonds of 1414

721
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
then make a ring

722
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
This we call ringhujing

723
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
that kind of

724
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This kind of tree you can count it this glucose

725
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
if it is six

726
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
We call it Afa

727
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
if there are seven we call beda

728
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If it's eight we call it Ama

729
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So what is the effect of this kind of Huang Hu Jing?

730
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
He's here to help deliver the drug

731
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
what does that mean i mean

732
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
These O-curved concepts are actually clear water

733
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
it's all extra tide

734
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
but in this ring

735
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It is combing water

736
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
so everyone

737
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
this is a model

738
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
This is the model of loess gold

739
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
you can see it's red

740
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
The red one is tide

741
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
out of the tide

742
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
middle part

743
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
is comb water

744
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
so there are some

745
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
it seems that the drug

746
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
it is not easy to dissolve in water

747
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
it will use this loess gold

748
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
to be used as storage

749
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That is to say it can be used

750
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The effect of combing water

751
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
then go take this drug

752
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So this is loess gold

753
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
most commonly used

754
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But every time I see this molecule

755
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I just thought of another one

756
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Field Circle

757
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Everyone should be at Mr.Bona

758
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
should always know

759
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But this situation is really like

760
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But when I saw this, I thought of another one

761
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
When I was doing Ph.D. and research at Berkeley

762
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
At that time, the Berkeley chemistry department had a very important tradition

763
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's all right, come to the Seminar

764
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They will definitely prepare two boxes of Bona at 12 o'clock

765
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and then there's coffee

766
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
They invite the speaker to chat with the teachers and students in the department

767
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
They finally eat very simple

768
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
They're finally just a piece of bona with a cup of coffee

769
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Then after eating, chat and go in to listen to the Seminar

770
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So at that time it was said No Bona, No Seminar

771
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So as long as you don't prepare Bona

772
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
No one will go to your Seminar

773
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
No coffee, No can't see

774
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So our tradition of doing chemistry sometimes coffee

775
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The word KAMISHI is also very special

776
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
THURSDAY-TRI

777
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
THURSDAY-TRI THURSDAY

778
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So we mean to experiment

779
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
to try to know

780
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
do you just make it

781
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Another example is that you

782
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
If it is not circular

783
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but in a linear

784
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
put it in this shape

785
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
This is what you often see is starch.

786
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
There are two types of starch

787
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This is linear starch

788
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That is, all of them use Alpha1414

789
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
rattan cable link

790
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Another one is

791
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Starch with side chains

792
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That is to say, at the place of No. 6

793
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
it can be connected again

794
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and then form another

795
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So we can see that

796
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
this number six is ​​that

797
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
There will be some side chain sugars in it

798
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
This side chain sugar is usually very long

799
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This is a characteristic of starch

800
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Then everyone probably

801
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
in the last two weeks

802
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Because the public account has the most pages in Taiwan is this Dudian fan

803
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen, there are currently 21 kinds of chemical powders merged by the Department of Health and Hygiene

804
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Manufacturers will make smart

805
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
he just adds something

806
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
like maleic acid

807
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
or dry maleic acid

808
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
add these things

809
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
to increase flexibility

810
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Everyone, if you look carefully

811
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The Department of Health and Health can say that what can be added is fumaric acid

812
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Why?

813
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Because this is in our metabolism

814
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
In the silver gate acid cycle

815
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Naturally there will be something like this

816
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So this is what we have in our body

817
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
is safe

818
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You can add this thing to make it more elastic

819
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But why are manufacturers different

820
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I will choose this again

821
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
The price is too smart

822
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
The manufacturer is like this

823
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,000
He is looking for cheap

824
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So this is the cheapest

825
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
this is the cheapest

826
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
When this hits water

827
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
He will be hydrolyzed

828
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
become this thing

829
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh, he is actually the manufacturer.

830
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
He just wants to choose cheap

831
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
And he doesn't care about other people's lives

832
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
so everyone here

833
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I always thought it was a class with a chemist student

834
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I always talk

835
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You study chemistry and science

836
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You must have a compassionate heart

837
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You must not go to those harming something

838
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
go go go go make money

839
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So folks, because in the lives of students

840
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
you can get some

841
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
something poisonous

842
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
some bad

843
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
for example

844
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
you will get swimming

845
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Swimming, you see who is unhappy, you have to return him to the cage

846
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I used to meet students at Tsinghua University who said

847
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Finishing the water is another matter

848
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,400
Another one is about liking a girlfriend

849
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,600
because girls

850
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,640
want to say make her sick

851
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,800
Let her go to the hospital to take care of her

852
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Just wanted to say in her drink

853
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,940
put poison on her

854
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,940
She gave her dogs

855
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,800
Turns out her girl didn't drink

856
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,800
It was a guy in her lab who drank

857
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,100
In the end, that man had to undergo kidney dialysis.

858
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,900
Then you say these are

859
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,200
how to say that

860
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,040
we're all talking about this

861
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,700
make a fuss like this

862
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,800
IQ has nothing to do with this kind of IQ

863
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,600
So sometimes you're smarter

864
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
On the contrary, I will do some stupid things more and more

865
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,800
so this is

866
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
people also think

867
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,300
my personal opinion

868
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,600
I still think the font Qunde

869
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,500
still the most important

870
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,000
kids teach it well

871
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,600
get it done

872
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,100
In good health

873
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,200
Then he will always find

874
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,400
A place suitable for his development

875
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
like a rope

876
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,000
will always find a suitable land for his development

877
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,900
That

878
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,400
the one we just talked about

879
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,100
DC diacid these

880
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,600
You can use HPLC

881
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
some to check

882
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Then there is also the inspection method of this starch.

883
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Usually, points are used to test

884
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So what you guys are doing, let's say

885
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
you have high school kids at home

886
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Or maybe we're doing some high school kids

887
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
you usually learn that

888
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Use dots to test starch

889
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
is there any

890
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That means you just add

891
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Point in the water will become

892
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Iz-h

893
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
will then become

894
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
half heavy color

895
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
but if it has come into existence

896
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
you will become very deep

897
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
blue

898
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
blue purple color

899
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
then this

900
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
everybody

901
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
this sandalwood

902
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
If you didn't pay back

903
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
is open

904
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
it will have

905
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
sort of like a spiral

906
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
that this spiral

907
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
like that shows

908
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
that this

909
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You can see that

910
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
this dot molecule

911
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I just mentioned

912
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
spiral

913
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
that

914
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
that shot hit

915
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,200
The slow part in the middle belongs to crisp water

916
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,300
So point molecules can run into it

917
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,600
It doesn't exist as I3-4 when you run there

918
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,000
It is based on I2

919
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,400
For point molecules

920
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,000
what color is the molecule itself

921
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,900
It's very masculine

922
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,000
that color is laid out

923
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,700
So you can use that to detect

924
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,800
The presence of this starch

925
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,400
everyone at the night market

926
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,300
Or you don't have a shop at home

927
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,300
You always go to buy this pen

928
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:39,100
How does the end note pen identify this end note

929
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,900
That's actually very simple

930
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,600
because normal paper

931
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,500
We're all made of ginger paper

932
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,300
When the paper was just finished

933
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,700
Actually they are bumpy

934
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,500
And all these companies that make paper

935
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,800
It's going to treat its surface with ginger

936
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,200
Then this paper will be very average

937
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
very nice, so you can use

938
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Well, this is also a normal paper dismantling.

939
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
paper, which is made of cotton and thin cloth as cotton

940
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So we usually use this book

941
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Or the material you are holding is paper

942
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
are pulped

943
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
There is no Chaohua, so Chaohua touches the water

944
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's okay, it can be dried and used

945
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
When the paper touches water, don't say that it will be polluted if the saliva is sprayed on it.

946
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's because of the slurry treatment on it

947
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So what is the general super ratio for?

948
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
there is nothing in it

949
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's just a little bit easier, it's as simple as that

950
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So that is to say, today if you take your color printer

951
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Then I went to be this two thousand yuan

952
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You print it out, then take it and buy it again

953
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Of course it can hold that pen

954
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
how to get dark blue

955
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
it says you take that

956
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That piece of ordinary paper went in

957
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
So this is how they identify super

958
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But I always feel that some people who specialize in printing counterfeit banknotes are still very powerful

959
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,800
He always had the ability to get paper that wasn't this ordinary

960
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,400
always take this special paper

961
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
The most special thing is that most people can't buy it

962
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,400
It is usually the country that goes with a specific

963
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,400
printing paper

964
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,600
Ladies and gentlemen, let's talk about the report

965
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,800
i think i seriously misremembered

966
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I didn't see the report a while ago

967
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,200
North Korea is the best

968
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,600
North Korea prints a lot of dollar bills

969
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Do you have

970
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,400
His reports are North Korean diplomats

971
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,400
he has a very important responsibility

972
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,600
He wanted the hundreds of thousands of fake dollar bills that were given to him in the country

973
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
be responsible for turning it into real money

974
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,000
then shipped back

975
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So his production is really beautiful

976
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Almost all machines are useless

977
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,200
This is really the report

978
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,500
It's mentioned in the west

979
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,200
Another thing related to this is glycogen

980
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,700
glycogen in our body

981
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,200
It is accumulated in the liver

982
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,900
Glycogen is the same as the starch just now

983
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,200
In fact, starch with side chains is very similar to

984
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,500
It's also all Alpha-14 or Alpha-16 links

985
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,200
But this part of its side chain is relatively short

986
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,800
Can the starch we just talked about be chained for a long time, right?

987
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,200
Glycogen is shorter

988
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,200
That's what glycogen looks like

989
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,700
so after we ate

990
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,900
Will eat after carbohydrates

991
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,600
Excess is stored in the liver

992
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,600
That excess will sometimes easily form this fatty liver

993
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,700
So guys, if you guys go for that ultrasound

994
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,300
The doctor said, why does your liver look brighter?

995
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,000
then you have to be a little tight

996
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,400
Because when the five internal organs look dark, right?

997
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,800
If it is brighter, it is a tendency to have a fatty liver

998
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,800
Then you would even say that your liver may be the first half of

999
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,100
come a little bigger

1000
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,440
So how do we avoid fatty liver or diabetes

1001
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,960
I actually think we're pretty much experts

1002
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,400
Because of avoidance of serious treatment

1003
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,280
So the home of preventive medicine

1004
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,200
avoidance of attention

1005
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,000
so notice what

1006
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
sports

1007
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,800
sports

1008
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,200
snack sugar sports

1009
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,000
this is the most important

1010
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,720
but i went to the doctor

1011
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,200
I almost freaked out after I saw the doctor

1012
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,680
we all get sick sometimes

1013
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,400
no time to exercise

1014
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Hello students

1015
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,200
Then the next sentence is to say

1016
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,400
You don’t take care of your health now, you want to take care of a doctor

1017
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,600
so really want to

1018
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,600
everyone can spare more time

1019
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,400
able to exercise more

1020
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,000
Then talk about this Tuantan

1021
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,200
what we just said

1022
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,600
You if you can use your body to move

1023
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
it is capable

1024
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,200
it's not powerless

1025
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,000
so you can move around

1026
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
Take the hepatopancreas in your liver to eliminate

1027
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,200
But some people are just poor

1028
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,400
He can't use this way

1029
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,300
what is this

1030
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,000
so-called genetic disease

1031
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,800
Guys, he heard it a while ago

1032
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,000
hepatoenteropathy

1033
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,400
There are so-called back municipalities

1034
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,000
Speaking of this back-to-back municipal

1035
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,200
Be sure to listen to the seniors of our former Holy Medical Institute

1036
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
It is our Academician Chen Yiren

1037
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,200
He just developed this

1038
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,900
Millet Long

1039
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,200
This is a glucose hydrolase

1040
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,900
Then he can come and hydrolyze this

1041
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,200
accumulate this liver

1042
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,600
can come and save these little kids

1043
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,400
So because of this success story

1044
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,000
Hawaii also made it into a movie

1045
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,300
Also recruited two famous stars

1046
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,400
Harrison Ford splits school with this Brandon

1047
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,000
right

1048
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
everybody

1049
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,200
when we saw this picture

1050
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,500
I looked at the back one very carefully.

1051
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,000
back

1052
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,780
The structure of the above plate is really good or bad

1053
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,140
This is an M.I possible

1054
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,280
Then he made several

1055
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,680
that's all right

1056
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,140
so he really is

1057
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,740
i need someone special to go

1058
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,440
to draw over there

1059
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Actually I think

1060
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,840
That's Penguin

1061
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,540
That's glucose hydrolase

1062
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,540
what is he holding

1063
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,180
very conceptual

1064
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,280
that this

1065
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,380
I think they are great actors

1066
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,580
seems to drive well

1067
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,080
just very special

1068
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,860
the other one is

1069
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,360
polysaccharide kidney

1070
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,060
You see some

1071
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,460
a pure disease

1072
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,160
That is to say, the hydrolytic enzyme that your body lacks

1073
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,860
which then leads to the accumulation of these sugars

1074
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,460
So this is some kind of acidic polysaccharide

1075
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,160
Then it will cause the accumulation of this cell

1076
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,560
Then this accumulates in the head

1077
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,160
Like this accumulates in the eyes, right?

1078
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,760
eyes will swell

1079
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,860
accumulated in the head

1080
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,160
swollen

1081
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,760
Then get fat in the heart

1082
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,000
So these years polysaccharide

1083
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,680
It's really hard for the baby in the court, very poor

1084
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,140
I think you should have

1085
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,480
have you seen these reports

1086
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,960
That's a genetic disease

1087
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,760
It's not the kid's fault

1088
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
This is a parental home review

1089
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,760
why do you say that

1090
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,760
Because all of this is because

1091
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,260
you need a pre-marital health check

1092
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,560
This is very important

1093
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,060
You must first understand what is inside your body

1094
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,560
Do you have a recessive gene like that?

1095
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,560
if your dad has

1096
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
Your mother will try to find

1097
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
If your father and mother have

1098
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
you have a one in four chance

1099
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
just as if

1100
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,560
But here in Taiwan

1101
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
It just so happens that there is such a history

1102
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
and he gave birth to a

1103
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
He wants to bet a second time

1104
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,560
He gave birth to three

1105
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
what do you say

1106
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
sometimes to god like this

1107
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
so this is very important

1108
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
You must have a pre-marital health checkup before you get married.

1109
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
put some of these

1110
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
you have to pay special attention to things

1111
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,340
In Australia, the B-valve of Minlutan VII is particularly high

1112
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,860
This is for your reference

1113
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:10,460
Next, I will introduce to you the little tree

1114
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:15,180
Few trees, walk outside, plants are abundant in every way

1115
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,340
fresh tree, if the leaves are picked off

1116
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,420
Enlarge the leaves, and enlarge this place again

1117
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,260
Zoom in on the chair again and you'll see glucose here

1118
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,620
It's all glucose

1119
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,620
so link up

1120
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,220
this one, its

1121
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:38,460
Here's the link, it's all using Bella 1,4

1122
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,180
It is different from the starch dry tank just now

1123
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,740
The starch dry tank just now uses α1,4

1124
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,540
Bella

1125
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,380
Bella 1,4, you will see its structure

1126
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,580
It has intramolecular clarity and intermolecular clarity

1127
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,420
even have a face-to-face meeting

1128
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,060
So the one on this side looks relatively flat

1129
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,180
different

1130
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,980
Could it be the person just now talking about what a computer is?

1131
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You will choose right? The first number is not, the first number is flat

1132
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Then why do people eat powder to provide energy? Eating grass does not work

1133
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Then this is very simple, because we only have Ah Fa, the bathroom does not need to charge money

1134
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
We don't have a backup, we don't have a backup bathroom don't charge very much

1135
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So people are happy for food, not food

1136
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Of course it will help you defecate and lose weight, it won't be cheap

1137
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Those grassy ones, why do most of them eat grass and turn them into powder?

1138
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The exception is often, let's say ordinary grass, as its stomach is more

1139
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It's not like we have only one stomach, it has several stomachs

1140
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Inside one of the stomachs, it has cells

1141
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,960
Bacteria, Bacteria has this Bebais glucose dumpling in it

1142
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,460
so it can break down this fiber

1143
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,200
So look at this food-based animal, after it eats the food

1144
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,200
It will have a stomach left to grind it first

1145
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,300
After grinding, then it will reflect whether there is

1146
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,800
It's the current that goes to the mouth, and then stirs again

1147
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,800
Then it will swallow the stomach inside

1148
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,800
That's it, that's why we're different

1149
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,300
As soon as we ate it we went down a bit

1150
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,300
There is only one stomach, and their ingredients are different

1151
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,300
Another one that you often hear is keting seeds

1152
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:35,300
This ketone seed, usually in the false insect

1153
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,300
There are fake worms in the empty worms

1154
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
or this crab

1155
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,300
or shrimp

1156
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,300
There are a lot of these chitin seeds in this shell

1157
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,300
So everyone is hearing that in the park

1158
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,300
science park

1159
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:55,300
It's really just that there are people who specialize in collecting these shells.

1160
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,300
That is to say, you are the shrimp moon, and you are the meat inside

1161
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,300
leave me that shell

1162
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,960
Designing hydrolysis tanks of the hundreds of liters

1163
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,340
Then do hydrolysis

1164
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:07,500
I'll talk about it later

1165
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
What will become of it when it is hydrolyzed?

1166
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Then you can listen to this fund word

1167
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,500
It is grape goose

1168
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,500
Then it's all about the medical links

1169
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,500
So this place it links to

1170
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,500
It is very similar to the cellulose you just mentioned

1171
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
belong to this form

1172
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,500
Then I will introduce to you

1173
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,500
The third part is about

1174
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,500
Introduction of sugary health food and medicine

1175
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
what about the first one

1176
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,500
I'm going to tell you about

1177
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,500
Gule Shami

1178
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
This is what I just said

1179
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,500
Are you going to collect a lot of these shells, right?

1180
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,500
Then it hydrolyzes it

1181
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
it does hydrolysis what does it use to do hydrolysis

1182
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
with hydrochloric acid

1183
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,500
After the hydrochloric acid is hydrolyzed

1184
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
These will also be hydrolyzed

1185
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,500
So what you get is

1186
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,500
Salts of hydrochloric acid of grape goose

1187
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Then we measure this thing by

1188
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,400
Therefore, lacto acid shows that it is translated directly in English.

1189
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,000
So lactoamine is translated into Gulesamin

1190
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,900
I ask you classmates

1191
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,900
If we can be called Grape Anton

1192
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,100
heart nothing special

1193
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,300
the problem is here

1194
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,900
gluxamine

1195
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,300
it's in the blood

1196
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,300
It's the same as glucose

1197
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,100
It will combine with the Nido Tree Society

1198
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,900
So if you say you have elders

1199
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,300
So someone is taking Gulesamin

1200
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,800
You should pay attention to whether you have diabetes yourself

1201
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,200
because it goes the same way

1202
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,800
we eat glucose

1203
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,800
like your blood sugar

1204
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,400
High glycogen levels in the blood

1205
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
Because it's the Nido tree that's going to combine with it

1206
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,800
this too

1207
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,800
This man is actually exactly the same

1208
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
So if you take Gulesamin

1209
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,000
be very careful

1210
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,700
Just be careful with diabetics

1211
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,600
The problem is below here

1212
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Because of this Gulsamin

1213
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,700
It is said that the market has hundreds of millions

1214
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,300
So everyone has gone to that mass factory

1215
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,800
because it's a bunch of

1216
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,900
we want it to use

1217
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,500
Is this thing useful?

1218
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
Can it really improve joints?

1219
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,300
I don't think anyone has tried this either

1220
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,700
Everyone says we've used a lot of experts

1221
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,600
In fact, the answer we got

1222
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,600
The poop tells us it's a placebo

1223
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,800
It is what Master often said, peace of mind will bring peace

1224
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,200
Do you think it's useful if you eat it

1225
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,000
it will be fine

1226
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,000
this is sometimes in my heart

1227
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,600
This idea is also important

1228
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
but true is not valid

1229
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Everyone, it's theoretically like this

1230
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,200
It is wished to say that you ate this Gule Shami

1231
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,400
Then your body will synthesize

1232
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,000
right

1233
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,800
then you deep synthesis

1234
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,800
deep synthesis of something

1235
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,400
hyaluronic acid

1236
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,800
right

1237
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,400
Hyaluronic acid is hot right now

1238
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
you want to wrinkle

1239
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,800
or to

1240
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,000
inside our eyes

1241
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
That's our Bo Li translation called hyaluronic acid

1242
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Is the surface of our eyes smooth?

1243
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Right?

1244
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
That's hyaluronic acid in it

1245
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Our knees should be lubricated

1246
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So this hyaluronic acid is produced

1247
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
hyaluronic acid content

1248
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
it is a polymer

1249
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
The higher the quality, the better

1250
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
because of its water absorption

1251
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
the highest moisture content

1252
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You'll have to look it up on Wikipedia

1253
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
what hyaluronic acid

1254
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
highest quality

1255
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Machine irrigation

1256
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
machine irrigation

1257
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The hyaluronic acid in it has the highest quality

1258
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Than you use the way I live

1259
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Than what planning method do you use

1260
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Chemical methods are even better

1261
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But I need to say something like this today

1262
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
don't want

1263
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So we are going to be killed

1264
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
no inside most true

1265
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
then hopefully

1266
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
We are all like this hyaluronic acid

1267
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
but you can see

1268
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
these hyaluronic acid

1269
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
It is the composition of putao acid sugar

1270
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
One is putao acid sugar

1271
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The other one is N to CG putao acid sugar

1272
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
so if you really want to eat

1273
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
which one we will suggest you to eat

1274
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
eat this

1275
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
N to CG's Putao acid sugar

1276
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
because after eating it

1277
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
will not immediately enter the degree

1278
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Same as Putao

1279
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
To combine with Ijima tree

1280
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
this is what you need to prove

1281
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
so this

1282
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Won't make you a problem with diabetes mellitus

1283
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
if say you want to eat this

1284
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
if you think it's not enough

1285
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
you don't add this

1286
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because it forms sugar

1287
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Yes need two sugar

1288
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
so many

1289
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
now you go to that

1290
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The kind of biotech company that sells drugs

1291
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
start many recipes

1292
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Just the price of sugar

1293
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Various recipes from companies other than their own

1294
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
This is what it says

1295
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's that simple

1296
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So the main meaning is

1297
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,420
ornithium

1298
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,800
The other one is that you usually put it in the advertisement

1299
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,300
see the so-called gnosis polysaccharide

1300
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,420
Especially the former Chinese anchor

1301
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,300
Ms. Xuan Miyang

1302
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,800
Advertisement of Grape Network, right?

1303
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,200
The polysaccharides that are also gnostic also eat a lot

1304
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,300
Everyone, polysaccharides of Gnosis

1305
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,000
How to kill cancer cells

1306
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Polysaccharides do not kill cancer cells

1307
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:30,200
Polysaccharides are what you need to be able to get into your gut

1308
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,600
enter the stomach here

1309
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,200
Then the water and blood components are made into smaller things like this

1310
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,200
and then to the intestines to stimulate your immune system

1311
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,700
Then your immune system goes to fight the cancer cells

1312
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,700
So this thing itself will not kill cancer cells

1313
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,400
So please don't get it wrong

1314
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,600
that this one

1315
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,200
polysaccharides

1316
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,600
mostly this kind of glucose

1317
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,000
Then practice it with Beda 1 3 1 3 sugar tip

1318
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,500
with practice it will work

1319
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,800
this is the most

1320
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,600
This is the basic stock price

1321
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,600
Usually there are some single tangs connected at the 6th place

1322
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,600
It may be Grape Church, it may be Yuanzao Church, it may be others

1323
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,600
A variety of these possible single tangs

1324
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,600
But so far, there is still no solution for this

1325
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,800
Why? Because what is the composition of these things in practice

1326
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,400
It's still unclear

1327
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:30,800
This includes our dean, who is also working on this part

1328
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,800
There is another one that I want to mention to you is the so-called Gansu

1329
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,800
Gansu

1330
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,800
I'm doing it, if you have elders, if I'm doing some kind of chemotherapy

1331
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,300
POTA is often used sometimes

1332
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,300
POTA sometimes goes to wash for a while

1333
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,700
why? because it clots the blood

1334
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,200
That's what you need to use for anticoagulation.

1335
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,700
Gansu

1336
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
a lot of

1337
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
former Gansu

1338
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
where are they from

1339
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
mostly from the mainland

1340
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
mainland

1341
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So before the mainland

1342
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Before 2008

1343
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Who is the richest person in mainland China

1344
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
It's for Gansu

1345
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Why

1346
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Because the mainland has a population of 1.3 billion

1347
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Do you know how many pigs he kills a day?

1348
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
you know i'm here you wanna laugh

1349
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
He wants to kill tens of millions of pigs

1350
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
These he put these fields

1351
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
after receiving

1352
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Then go get this Gansu

1353
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Year 2008

1354
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
what's a problem

1355
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
He went to get this Gansu

1356
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
He adds other things to you in it

1357
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
that is

1358
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
there was a so-called

1359
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
over-safety

1360
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
contrading-safety

1361
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
that thing

1362
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
that thing

1363
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
add that thing

1364
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
he's okay sometimes

1365
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
want to increase his weight

1366
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
go bag that one

1367
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Turns out that thing is responsible

1368
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
As a result, several people died

1369
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
So the United States is scared

1370
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,400
He specially went to their site to see

1371
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,700
You can see the power outage like this

1372
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,900
You are under GMP control

1373
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,300
So the United States is scared

1374
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,900
So it becomes to say that from 2008 onwards

1375
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,500
You want to buy Gansu again

1376
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,500
otherwise you can't buy

1377
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,500
or low molecular weight Gansu

1378
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,700
can't buy now

1379
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:24,900
Why? Because I dare not enter

1380
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,500
so here

1381
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,800
Everyone see it

1382
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,700
Recently there are some

1383
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,700
a dance hall

1384
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,900
this dance hall

1385
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,200
It is specifically used for anticoagulation

1386
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,300
This dance hall body is already a medicine

1387
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,000
already in the US

1388
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,900
or here in Europe

1389
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,100
already a drug

1390
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,700
We were doing this first

1391
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:55,000
This one is selling pretty well right now.

1392
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,500
its price is quite high

1393
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,700
So now is to try to make it as low as possible

1394
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:00,700
able to evolve

1395
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:07,000
In this case, I hope that in the future, it will be much better if we build our capital and get rich.

1396
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This is a stage, a structure

1397
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It can be combined with MHCB so this single

1398
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
It can be used for anticoagulant effect

1399
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
There are also some anticancer drugs that you often hear

1400
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
The most leading one is Xiao Hongmei

1401
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
everyone has heard

1402
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Little Red Beauty is all cancer drugs

1403
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Everyone in these classes can see that

1404
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
In fact, except for this ring

1405
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Three structures on this side of this ring

1406
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It is very important that it contains a sugar

1407
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
This candy also plays a very important role in helping you

1408
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
We thus self-satisfy

1409
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
This mainly means that this place is a flat structure

1410
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It will hack into BMA's Migel Roof

1411
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Larger ore finer places

1412
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
it will cut into that place

1413
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
can then reach

1414
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
This anti-cancer effect

1415
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
that thing

1416
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Belly is not small

1417
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
so it's beautiful when you hit it

1418
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
hair loss

1419
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Vomit

1420
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
These questions are often

1421
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Everyone

1422
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
recently

1423
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
many of these drugs

1424
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
when you use that viz

1425
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Just Liposome

1426
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
to wrap this

1427
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
the stomach will be much lower

1428
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
will reduce a lot

1429
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Then

1430
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Vomiting will also be reduced a lot

1431
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
so everyone

1432
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Unfortunately, this old man doesn't have many copies.

1433
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
but you can discuss it with your doctor

1434
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
If the family can afford it

1435
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
you can

1436
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Can use

1437
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
hit this thing

1438
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
will compare

1439
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
It's beautiful when you hit it directly

1440
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
came much better

1441
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
In addition, some anticancer drugs

1442
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
like this is

1443
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
This Purel2

1444
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
injection

1445
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
then these are

1446
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
i have a lot of people bring it up

1447
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
that is

1448
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
these cancer drugs

1449
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
it's actually quite sugary

1450
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
help you get these candies

1451
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
to the doctor

1452
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
it won't work

1453
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,700
So many people want to know what role this sugar stone plays

1454
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,100
Does it just increase solubility?

1455
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,900
It's not that simple

1456
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,900
So this is commonly used, this Cornia

1457
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,100
There are also some antibacterial antibiotics

1458
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,200
This is made with a lot of bacteria sugar men

1459
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,200
This is specifically for the muddy urine system

1460
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,100
To deal with that E. coli infection

1461
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,100
And like mud urine male mud

1462
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,300
These are very amine-based

1463
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:32,400
antibacterial

1464
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,300
This is also used in our daily life

1465
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,400
Ladies and gentlemen, where do you go for the medicine to see your ingredients?

1466
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,100
still don't understand

1467
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,800
I don't understand, I need to check

1468
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,000
The current Internet is too differentiated

1469
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,500
we both have to check

1470
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,800
So you need to find out what ingredients are in the medicine you used

1471
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,700
to know its side effects

1472
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,500
This is all available

1473
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,900
Another is the red cotton tree

1474
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,100
The red cotton tree is also

1475
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So use a lot when you have inflammation

1476
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
The same goes for everyone

1477
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It also has these sugars here

1478
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Then these sugars will go to the bacteria

1479
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
The drug is called RNA

1480
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
and then to be aware of its growth

1481
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That's one of its effects

1482
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Then there is another one

1483
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
What you often hear is

1484
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
third line antibiotics

1485
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
vancomycin

1486
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
vancomycin

1487
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Usually when you don't even have this antibiotic

1488
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
you probably want

1489
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
just be right please

1490
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
because possible

1491
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
some derivatives of it

1492
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
some other variants of it

1493
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
If there is no more effective doctor

1494
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
it can't help

1495
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So this is already the third line

1496
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
followed by antibiotics

1497
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
this is the same

1498
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
this antibiotic

1499
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
It also has the structure of these sugars

1500
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And without this sugar

1501
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
its efficacy will be listed

1502
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And our common Chinese herbal medicine

1503
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
You have heard of real herbs

1504
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
that herb

1505
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,400
Many of them are fried or watered.

1506
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,000
It doesn't have to be in the water to fry with water

1507
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,100
Why don't you drink it? There are a lot of things in it.

1508
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,100
all contain sugar

1509
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,400
Let me give you an example

1510
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,900
The innermost example is hay

1511
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,500
hay

1512
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,800
hay this

1513
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,800
This is the main ingredient in it

1514
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:19,500
this is a special

1515
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,900
That is, we start from a sticker class

1516
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,900
There are also some sugary things over here

1517
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,400
that at that time

1518
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,900
hay means

1519
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,900
Some cores for some antiviral aspects

1520
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
and some like cardiotonic

1521
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,500
For us there is a so-called Bitutoxin

1522
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
This category belongs to Cde-Glycoside

1523
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,300
That is to say, it has a sterol

1524
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
sterols and then sugars

1525
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
This is blown from the flower of a plant in Africa

1526
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,500
Then tell me you have a heart problem

1527
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,000
if say you let breath

1528
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,500
no way heart

1529
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,000
the so-called master gill

1530
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Putting this disability is something that can be proxied

1531
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,200
Vasodilation

1532
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,920
The above is about the general we common these

1533
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,000
Introduction of healthy food or medicine

1534
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,760
Then I'm going to talk to him a little bit

1535
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,960
glucose metabolism

1536
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,400
I won't go into the details of those

1537
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,800
step by step metabolism

1538
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,960
Just to tell you in general

1539
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,520
let's make an introduction

1540
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,400
We ate the usual glucose

1541
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,560
the most important thing is to do

1542
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,960
is to be able to generate energy

1543
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,000
what is this energy

1544
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,560
is our energy currency

1545
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,000
That is ATP

1546
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,560
what is this

1547
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,720
You can see that

1548
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,800
glucose

1549
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,320
Then essential oil glycolysis

1550
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,560
Then get this row

1551
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,640
then this is

1552
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,240
No. 2 has a bottle of this acid on the same plane

1553
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,600
Then what

1554
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,360
Its ATP can be converted into ATP

1555
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,760
And here is its structure

1556
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,040
Mainly

1557
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,200
Here are two bottles of acid

1558
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,560
This side becomes three bottles of acid

1559
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,320
Then this ATP

1560
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,400
is what we call energy currency

1561
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,560
It can be used to provide energy

1562
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,560
that here

1563
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,960
Our glycolysis is also fast

1564
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,340
In this ranking, there are basically hillside map letters that can be walked

1565
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,500
We normally take this picture letter of swimming

1566
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:11,540
so it will go through the acid cycle

1567
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,140
Then finally mix carbon dioxide with water

1568
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,540
can then be discharged

1569
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,340
If today, if you are relatively hypoxic

1570
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,840
Then there is a chance that this will turn into halogen acid

1571
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,480
vitamin brine

1572
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,780
vitamin brine this side

1573
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:29,480
it is without oxygen

1574
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,680
it can turn it into an inch

1575
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,820
so here

1576
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,520
Often we will be assigned a

1577
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,180
Why stay up late to practice books or play rehearsal

1578
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,020
you will feel hungry

1579
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:42,580
Do you have

1580
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,080
Will it feel like this at the end

1581
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,180
It will be better

1582
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,420
This is actually

1583
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:52,120
Because our brains use a lot of energy

1584
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,020
energy needed by the brain

1585
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,320
is to use sugar to hydrolyze acid

1586
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,680
it is used very quickly

1587
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,280
our organs

1588
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,180
Do our organs also need

1589
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
But the energy our organs need

1590
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Demolition is not required

1591
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Is there only one other mechanism for a carbonless bomb

1592
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Then if it's the bombardment

1593
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
This is for your quick access to that energy

1594
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
So you find this place in your brain

1595
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
do it fast

1596
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Because you have to think when you are full

1597
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
other things to think about

1598
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So this consumes quickly

1599
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
That's why you get this hunger feeling

1600
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
So it talks about how to break through this one

1601
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
soon

1602
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Then why do we exercise

1603
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
after muscle exercise

1604
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
We sometimes get that muscle sore the next day

1605
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Is there such a problem

1606
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Then

1607
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
the next day it was

1608
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
The amount of oxygen in your thin stomach because of your muscular movement

1609
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
just not enough

1610
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Insufficient

1611
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
then it produces lactic acid

1612
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So your muscle soreness is due to lactic acid

1613
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So lactic acid is not a good thing

1614
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
in the intestine will excrete your sugar

1615
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That bowel will lactic acid quickly

1616
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
right

1617
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
so you'll see what you've got

1618
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,620
Going this way is more hypoxic and sugary, right?

1619
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:06,620
Did you ever drink alcohol when you were young?

1620
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,620
people may have also tried

1621
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,620
Because when I was young, I often couldn't help measuring alcohol

1622
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:14,620
open it

1623
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:16,620
see what happens

1624
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,620
you will run in with oxygen

1625
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:22,620
Then if you run in and drink, you will become something like that

1626
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,620
that vinegar

1627
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,620
So the resulting wine is very sour

1628
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,620
what is the reason

1629
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,620
It's because he walks this way

1630
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,080
Your current lip it will go further

1631
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,080
it may be spring or alcohol

1632
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,080
Then further oxidation becomes acidic

1633
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,080
So when you measure wine, you measure it into vinegar

1634
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,080
that this is about this

1635
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:41,080
I'm going to introduce this side

1636
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,080
Then I will introduce to you a little

1637
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:47,080
The fifth part is about this sugar on the cell surface

1638
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,080
Some other biological tools

1639
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,080
This side is more biased

1640
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,080
A little introduction to glycobiology

1641
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,080
what about here

1642
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,080
That's what we use the electron microscope lens

1643
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,520
Then look at this section of the cell

1644
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,680
So here's the nucleus

1645
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:06,960
then lipid

1646
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,960
that this place

1647
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,160
This place is called the membrane of the cell

1648
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,520
You see a very deep black thing

1649
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,640
This is like a layer of sugar

1650
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,280
so-called sugar republics

1651
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,720
it's on the outside of the cell

1652
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,600
So what is the situation with this sugar republic molecule?

1653
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:32,240
It is a very simple deep synthetic soil

1654
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,640
For your reference

1655
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,200
this is our cell membrane

1656
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,520
There are many pores in our cell membrane

1657
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,800
water channel

1658
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,240
tunnel of mudstone

1659
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,600
what else is there

1660
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,280
Pores of the bladder

1661
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,560
This kind of tunnel

1662
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:50,000
Then the sugar can enter the cell

1663
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,600
in this cell

1664
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,740
In addition to glycolysis

1665
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,800
Just like what I just said

1666
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,080
will generate RTP

1667
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,800
generate energy these

1668
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,040
In addition it can also be transformed into different these nuclear dry water

1669
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,240
Snap rod, sorry, snap rod

1670
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,800
What are these for?

1671
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,360
These are used to make the so-called sugar assembly

1672
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,960
Then it can be used in high-quality subjects

1673
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,120
or internal fat pills

1674
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,040
this part of

1675
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,960
Synthesize these Sugar Pound Whites right here

1676
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,440
or candy paper

1677
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,920
that sugar pound white

1678
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,400
It depends on whether it is folded perfectly

1679
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,280
It doesn't work if it doesn't fold well

1680
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,240
Those perfectly folded

1681
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,600
With these candy papers it will

1682
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,160
Run from this place to the surface of this cell

1683
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,160
So you see that layer

1684
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,400
black is these things

1685
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,200
Sugar Woven Paper and Sugar Pound White

1686
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,000
Those things will age too

1687
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
or poorly folded

1688
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,880
Where does all this stuff go?

1689
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,600
enter this media

1690
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,720
It's like a hydrolysis factory in the media

1691
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,840
it will rehydrolyze all these things

1692
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,600
After hydrolysis, you will return to

1693
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,360
Back to Crown Sugar or Ankisu

1694
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,600
Then repeat the cycle again

1695
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,360
So our cell factory is very

1696
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,800
So effectively it's doing this in a loop

1697
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,300
it applies to every bit

1698
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:06,300
it won't go to waste

1699
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:12,900
So just look at the whole inside

1700
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:16,300
Like the people's body, do we have the annual certificate we just mentioned?

1701
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,400
The annual certificate is in the people's body

1702
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,100
Lack of this submerged coal

1703
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,100
that's a matter of genetics

1704
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:28,900
Then these sugar and molecules will be spread on the surface

1705
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:32,500
Then it will work with many foreign things

1706
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,300
including viral infections

1707
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:35,200
city ​​army infection

1708
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,600
or with some poison

1709
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,700
Poisonous mushrooms we often talk about

1710
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:45,300
Ladies and gentlemen, do you get poisoned when you eat a lot of mushrooms?

1711
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,400
or snake venom

1712
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,600
Bitten by a snake is not a venomous snake

1713
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,200
These things will follow the superficial effects

1714
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,700
So if you want to tell everyone in detail here

1715
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,400
probably another two hours

1716
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,700
the virus here

1717
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:03,960
Let me give you a very simple introduction

1718
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,760
Because this is related to our personal comparison

1719
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:11,200
Infectious diseases caused by viruses that are common in Taiwan

1720
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,620
Including influenza virus, enterovirus, style stomach, cannon disease, infection virus

1721
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:17,620
or pox etc.

1722
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,120
Isn't it human? Yang will also

1723
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,020
what about this

1724
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,200
about flu virus

1725
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,040
You can see that there is emotion

1726
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,840
or pigs feel

1727
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:29,300
or people

1728
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:30,800
human flu

1729
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,800
Everyone

1730
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,300
co-receptor

1731
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,300
it is

1732
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,300
it is

1733
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,300
and

1734
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,300
it is two

1735
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,300
it can

1736
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,300
can infect it

1737
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,800
So the problem that often breaks now is to say

1738
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,800
In the countryside

1739
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,800
In the country you raise pigs

1740
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,800
Do you know how to raise chickens?

1741
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,300
Do you know how to raise ducks?

1742
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,300
so what

1743
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,300
Then when the network rate is over, it will all be mixed together.

1744
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
So this is a comparison

1745
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,300
big problem

1746
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,300
Therefore, when the network rate is completed, it is necessary to command

1747
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,300
in the end is

1748
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,300
human head

1749
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,500
So it's going to be bad fuck right here

1750
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,000
that's here

1751
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
You can see this virus

1752
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,500
The surface of this virus has two very important methods

1753
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,000
One called Hemorrhidim

1754
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
not right

1755
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Everyone, just remember the first word

1756
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
is H

1757
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
The other one is Memidis

1758
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
is what we call the hydrolase of the so-called stripping acid

1759
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Didn't we just talk about stripping acid?

1760
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
This specialized hydrolyzed stripping acid

1761
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Don't carry them too much

1762
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Just don't recite N

1763
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So often a flu virus

1764
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Influenza A virus infection

1765
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
The doctor has been talking about how much H is

1766
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
how much N

1767
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
The same one

1768
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
The most recent one is H7N9

1769
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
The same one

1770
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That changes every year

1771
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Vaccinations are usually done every year

1772
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Please guess for a year

1773
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
How likely are you to guess correctly?

1774
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
some are ok

1775
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Some can't guess

1776
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,800
Then sometimes it is because the map will be worn

1777
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,600
But you guys are saying this is

1778
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,600
how to say it

1779
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,200
I think it has a pretty big effect.

1780
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,200
can do a defense

1781
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
Then this Pingnan Wutian Forest

1782
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,200
Can have 16 kinds

1783
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
Then to the last two years

1784
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,200
only to discover the 17th

1785
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,200
from that Australian bat

1786
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,700
Australian bat

1787
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:26,700
The 17th species found in that bat

1788
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,700
Then your map has 9 types

1789
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:31,100
that here

1790
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,600
Listen a little bit to say that this virus

1791
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,900
it

1792
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:37,100
It will use this H on its surface

1793
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:38,400
this protein

1794
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,100
with the sugar on the surface of our cells

1795
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,200
to act

1796
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,700
There will be a four other action on its side

1797
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,200
and then after that it will do

1798
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,400
Pendococcus

1799
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,700
then enters the cell

1800
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,000
then copy after

1801
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,600
After copying, it will finally go out, right?

1802
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,000
when it will go out

1803
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,100
Everyone, it's the surface

1804
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,800
We just talked about the surface of our cells

1805
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,400
it has that shoulder

1806
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,400
will use it

1807
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So after the virus replicates and infects

1808
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
When he wants to walk out of history

1809
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
He can't go out in history

1810
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
he's going to do another move

1811
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
what action

1812
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
It is to use the N we just talked about

1813
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
that half white

1814
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Put the penetrating doctor on the surface of this cell

1815
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
cut off

1816
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
he will be released

1817
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So now the source of many drugs

1818
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
passenger flu

1819
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
these drugs

1820
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
It's all about the N

1821
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
the enzyme dedevelopment inhibitor

1822
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
what does that mean

1823
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
That is to say, let you suppress N

1824
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
is to make it non-hydrolyzable

1825
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
then let this virus

1826
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
can stick to the surface of the cell

1827
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
keep it out

1828
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Can't let it out

1829
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
further our giant cell

1830
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
will come and cut it off

1831
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
so right here

1832
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
So this guest flu

1833
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
actually show you

1834
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
what we just said

1835
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
What is the lean body on the surface of this cell

1836
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
That is to say, today is again

1837
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
this kind of love

1838
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It is the link of the toy acid to the galactose which is Alpha 23

1839
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
So where do you pay special attention

1840
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
is this place

1841
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's Alpha 23 to link

1842
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
what if it's a human

1843
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Man is Alpha 26 to link

1844
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
So our upper respiratory system

1845
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
The chromophores on the surface of our cells are this

1846
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So that is to say

1847
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
pigeon cold

1848
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
you don't come up to talk

1849
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
not contagious

1850
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Conceptually

1851
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
but now

1852
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
always these viruses

1853
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
it will start to mutate

1854
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
those mutant viruses

1855
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,000
It can recognize both the Alpha 23

1856
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It also recognizes Alpha 26

1857
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
So when they both recognize Alpha 26

1858
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Our bodies experience panic

1859
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
because it's a vibes lawyer

1860
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
one does not know

1861
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,500
Therefore, the human body's supernatural system has always been interested in it from the very beginning.

1862
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,900
There is no way to prevent the epidemic from doing it

1863
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,500
Another long virus

1864
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:14,100
The most frightening thing about the long virus is this type 71

1865
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,500
This is what we call the hand-mouth group

1866
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,100
What about this? Internet teaching houses will remind children

1867
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,500
be sure to wash your hands

1868
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,800
Because this is eaten after dipping your hands in the cake

1869
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,200
This virus can pass through the human stomach

1870
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,700
will not die very powerful

1871
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,300
Because Rui said it was sour

1872
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:33,900
it won't die either

1873
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:37,900
Then go to the intestine and then infect the child's intestine

1874
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:43,700
After the infection over there, it caused these so-called hand-mouth problems

1875
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,900
that's here

1876
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:46,800
on our gut side

1877
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,600
Some recent research I found

1878
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,800
It should be with #23

1879
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,200
The communities of these links are more related

1880
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,500
And there's something personal about this official

1881
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,000
or

1882
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,160
Dungeon fever virus can bubble umbrella or stomach virus

1883
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,760
Hepatitis, everyone, is umbrella or Dungeness fever

1884
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,260
everyone is clear

1885
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:14,160
In the past one or two years, there was no morel disease in the Qingjing Camp

1886
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,960
So a lot of those sheep were killed

1887
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,760
These viruses use heparin on the cell surface

1888
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,200
You just mentioned heparin

1889
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,560
Heparin on the cell surface is a helper receptor

1890
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,320
to do the infection

1891
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,000
for example

1892
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,600
This is the scar phlegm reflected by the lights

1893
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,400
Can be used as a host for Amanitavirus

1894
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,800
Here we actually have to develop the core instead

1895
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,360
Take a test with Master Zhang Yilang

1896
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:58,120
Let's see that scar phlegm can prevent the infection of this umbrella virus

1897
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Next, I want to introduce to you about the candy on the surface of the red snowball.

1898
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,500
The first thing to mention is the discrimination of the water shape

1899
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,500
Everyone knows that the judgment of water shape is based on our

1900
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,200
What is the structure of the sugar that the homework needs to face?

1901
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,200
Hit to identify very hard water

1902
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:33,200
The O-shape is the putan sugar that connects sugar to galactose and then to this N-tailed CG

1903
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,200
This is O-shaped

1904
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:44,200
In addition to this fish, Type A also has a galactose with N-tailed CG added

1905
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,700
If it is V-shaped, here is a galactose

1906
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:54,200
So everyone can see that people with AV shape have both

1907
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,200
AV-shaped people have both

1908
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,200
So the first one will be Hot Blooded

1909
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:07,000
If your parents are both European-type, your child will definitely be European-type

1910
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
If one of your children today is type A or type D

1911
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Some family education came out

1912
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Another very important thing is that you read books, you must not learn from books

1913
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
how is this

1914
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I have antibodies in my body, and I can accept European-type antibodies

1915
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I will recognize him

1916
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
If it was said that your book was type A or type B that day

1917
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Is there one more here?

1918
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
There is one more thing, can my antibody recognize him? No

1919
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
so i bother you to take this for what ? foreign matter

1920
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
i will attack him

1921
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
can't attack him

1922
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
That day I said you today you are type A

1923
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You go to study European style

1924
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Can this thing occupy his position?

1925
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
so it's ok

1926
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Therefore, people of type A or type B can accept the learning of European people.

1927
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
But type A people cannot accept the learning of European type people.

1928
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,120
Because the two candies are different, right?

1929
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,600
Their sharp noses are unacceptable

1930
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,720
who is the best

1931
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,320
AV type people

1932
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,880
AV-type people are often acceptable

1933
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,360
is his advantage

1934
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,080
you tend to go for some chemo

1935
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,280
or do some combined treatment

1936
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,240
Blood counts often drop to very low

1937
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,640
especially red blood cells

1938
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:22,440
so inside the hospital

1939
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,560
Often an accepted Epo is used

1940
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,720
Epo is a sugar pound white

1941
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:29,640
its a sugar pound white

1942
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,640
Everyone see it

1943
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:31,920
This is NGIGON

1944
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,680
There's another OGIGON over here

1945
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,240
Currently this Sugar Pound White

1946
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,840
know something

1947
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,560
For the past year around the world

1948
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,600
I’m doing this for several popular settings

1949
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,120
Because this year's market is also huge

1950
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,600
Then several contacted scientists

1951
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,000
Now they are synthesizing this Sugar Pound White

1952
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,040
It is the Epo who once learned

1953
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,960
Because what comes naturally is a mixture

1954
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,000
everyone has been wanting

1955
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,160
synthesize this pure thing

1956
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,160
relatively controllable

1957
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:06,660
Then this is a very popular molecule

1958
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,840
The red snowball finished speaking

1959
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,160
Let me tell you about Snowball

1960
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,360
The white snowball is the initial step to our origin

1961
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,260
have a great relationship

1962
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,360
where is here

1963
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,800
That is to say, today our snowball

1964
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,100
White snowballs in our veins

1965
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,760
it's free

1966
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,660
it's free scrolling right

1967
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,460
then talk about it today

1968
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,360
we have a place to shoot

1969
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,920
Then this shot will stimulate

1970
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:32,120
will release this sieve

1971
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,160
Then it will let this blood vessel

1972
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,860
layer of cells

1973
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:38,860
will express this so-called

1974
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:41,120
Our so-called Eselecting

1975
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:41,820
Then this Eselecting

1976
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,260
I don't like how to divide

1977
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,620
Then this Eselecting

1978
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:47,160
It will be the same as the one on the white snowball

1979
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,060
This Green Formula X with Cracking Acid

1980
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:53,620
this sugar works

1981
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:54,420
after that effect

1982
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,140
will slow down the rolling of this white snowball

1983
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,680
because it rolls freely

1984
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,440
Then there is interaction here, let it slow down

1985
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,440
Slow down to what? Keep it from rolling

1986
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,600
After not rolling, the white shoe ball can move from this

1987
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:12,040
gap between the cells of the blood vessel wall

1988
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,640
can pass through

1989
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,440
and get to this hurting place

1990
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,140
Everyone, come here with white shoes

1991
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,240
it is the enemy also kill

1992
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,140
Your normal cells are also killed

1993
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,540
it doesn't recognize

1994
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:26,800
It is the killing of soldiers

1995
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,540
so it creates inflammation in your tissue

1996
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:32,340
So the problem is here

1997
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:36,840
So this is a more professional

1998
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,240
Just take a look, everyone

1999
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,600
That is to say this is

2000
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,200
The so-called very stripping acid

2001
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,600
BV4X

2002
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,540
this four halls

2003
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,340
Then follow the function of selecting

2004
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:51,240
Then this is just a show

2005
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,940
What is the most important thing?

2006
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,740
How do you know if you have inflammation in your body?

2007
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,940
The most important thing that doctors usually tell you to go

2008
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,640
Did you draw blood?

2009
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:05,160
Going to measure the amount of your white snowball

2010
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,880
what is the main thing

2011
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,880
It's our White Snowball's tactic

2012
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,880
win with more

2013
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,380
so when you have an inflamed place

2014
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:18,580
it produces a lot

2015
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:19,880
before being able to come

2016
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,080
then deal with it

2017
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,080
So when you draw blood and test

2018
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:24,880
Your white snowballs are relatively high

2019
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,880
The doctor will tell you that your inflammation

2020
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,380
Is it this way

2021
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,760
This is seen in this way

2022
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,760
what happens to your doctor with inflammation

2023
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,760
give you antibiotics

2024
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,760
will let you kill the bacteria

2025
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,760
But everyone, if you kill the bacteria today

2026
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,760
If it belongs to this

2027
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,760
this kind

2028
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,760
Gram-negative of this

2029
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,760
Bacteria

2030
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,760
Ladies and gentlemen, if you have a body with a lot

2031
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:51,760
bacteria

2032
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,760
Bacteria have to protect themselves too

2033
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,760
So it's good for you to resist the crispness

2034
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,760
Are the bacteria dead?

2035
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,760
right

2036
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,140
So when it dies it will release

2037
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,240
It's a cell currency thing, right?

2038
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,240
The most important one of the plaques of the cell currency is this

2039
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,700
We call the so-called Lipid A

2040
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:10,000
Limb A

2041
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,340
This thing is poisonous

2042
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:13,240
very poisonous

2043
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,840
so some people say

2044
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,800
Some people ask what causes scurvy

2045
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,600
That's where Yuanzong comes from

2046
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,440
so you see diabetics

2047
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,640
How did you die in the end?

2048
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,600
it's all because

2049
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,340
Because Mosha's nerve circulation is bad

2050
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,780
then black it out

2051
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,180
Then fattening

2052
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:34,480
Then there's the bacterial infection

2053
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,380
Bacterial infection ends up with acute sepsis

2054
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,380
Nine and a half out of ten

2055
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,640
so it's really

2056
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,540
this is torture

2057
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,240
so you're talking

2058
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,640
this chronic disease

2059
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,340
Diabetes is the worst kind

2060
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:51,780
because its whole process is like this

2061
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:54,980
That heart attack is the fastest

2062
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:57,480
No, just leave, just leave

2063
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,420
That high blood pressure is usually treated

2064
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:00,420
companies should know

2065
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:00,960
Mostly okay

2066
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,960
So be careful with diabetes

2067
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:08,040
In addition, there are some who are born with us

2068
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,720
The one that has a lot to do here is

2069
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,720
Sperm and primordial union

2070
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,320
This place also has this identification cleared to this sugar

2071
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,560
mainly here

2072
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,480
This is a mother's eye

2073
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,120
There are some membranes on the surface

2074
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:25,000
A special area we call ZP

2075
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:25,800
this area

2076
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,560
This region contains some proteins

2077
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,640
what about the protein

2078
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:32,320
It will recognize the sugar on the surface of the sperm

2079
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,560
identify sugar

2080
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,720
Then its sperm can stick to it

2081
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,840
after sticking

2082
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,080
Wait until the sperm enters and combines with sugar

2083
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,760
It's like combining with this dye

2084
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,200
it emits some grainy stuff

2085
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,720
will become the protection of the community

2086
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,360
no more sperm

2087
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:55,440
Just don't allow this other sperm to come in again

2088
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,640
So this is a process for the whole community

2089
01:24:58,640 --> 01:24:59,680
so here

2090
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,160
There will be a very important role in the identification of this sugar

2091
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:06,840
and some are

2092
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:09,160
I just found out about this polar region

2093
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:11,660
It is the fishes of Benshi and Antarctica

2094
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,240
these things

2095
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:15,460
Is it cold over there, everyone?

2096
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:16,660
not like us

2097
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:18,660
Our Australia is in the thirties

2098
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,760
So this tree can be done at more than 30 degrees

2099
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,960
But what if the temperature is as cold as that

2100
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,760
So these fish are also very powerful

2101
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,000
it developed the so-called

2102
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,660
Anti-Dynamic Eggs

2103
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,200
What about these anti-glycan eggs?

2104
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,320
it can protect them

2105
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,120
keep it still

2106
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,620
so it's that

2107
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,120
Down the tree can also be effective

2108
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:40,620
then next

2109
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,420
Now let me introduce

2110
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,120
about this

2111
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:46,460
Useful plate-based anti-cancer

2112
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,460
or a vaccine against infectious agonists

2113
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:51,120
Just now the vice president mentioned at the beginning

2114
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:54,620
That is, generally speaking, vaccines are used against those who seem to be infected

2115
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:57,820
How can it be used to fight cancer now?

2116
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,580
even say there are other

2117
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,280
this new disease

2118
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,600
So today’s relationship at this time is going to give three simple examples.

2119
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:07,000
Come for your reference

2120
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:10,000
The first one is milk film and vaccine

2121
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,560
This is currently approved by the FDA

2122
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,040
here in north america

2123
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,440
what is it for

2124
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,680
Is it possible to use the so-called Tupanic acid we just talked about?

2125
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,320
It uses this macrotonic acid

2126
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,240
the vaccine

2127
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,440
This one is used against this

2128
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,160
Milk film and vaccine

2129
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:32,760
So you can see that

2130
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,840
Normal milk film looks like this

2131
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,720
Then when it becomes inflamed

2132
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:40,240
this place is going to get serious

2133
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,040
Then this is the tonic acid that can be used

2134
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:48,440
What Fenggang mentioned just now is the so-called anti-cancer vaccine

2135
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,360
Anticancer vaccines are like this

2136
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,200
the first is

2137
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,320
It belongs to this kind of WC

2138
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,560
That and the Philippines

2139
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,400
these so-called

2140
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,600
cancerous

2141
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,520
anticancer

2142
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
This is a lot of these sugars on the surface of R cells

2143
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,500
and some are very special

2144
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,000
Only cells directly above a certain I

2145
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
for these antigens to exist

2146
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
The most famous one is Robo H

2147
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Robo H is a sugar qualification belonging to Robocerease

2148
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And this one is about fighting breast cancer

2149
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Then this Robo H is 6 sugar

2150
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Then this side is called Linus Serumis

2151
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
is a Lipetrin

2152
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
but here they are now

2153
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Because this is on the surface of the I cell

2154
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
unique to the surface of primary I cells

2155
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
So I want to say that there is something special about

2156
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
remove this place

2157
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Then this place goes to connect a

2158
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
a so-called carrier protein

2159
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Then use a carrier protein like this

2160
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
After connecting this sugar with 6 sugars

2161
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
it can go to induce its that

2162
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,160
body antibodies that can then come to recognize it

2163
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,960
Recognizing it can indicate that you have cells other than

2164
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,640
Its antibody will specifically fight against this

2165
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:16,280
Currently, this is in the third phase of clinical trials in Taiwan.

2166
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,840
Now do the third period

2167
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,720
We're going to see if we can succeed

2168
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:29,000
In addition to this, there is another type of Ganglion series we call

2169
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:33,800
This category belongs to the second category, and also belongs to this

2170
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,320
bladder related

2171
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,160
There is another one that belongs to the Lactose series

2172
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,520
So these different bladders

2173
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,280
its in different cancer cells

2174
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,160
It all has different amount of rendering

2175
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,800
Another one is the so-called anti-inner ridge

2176
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,080
Development of vaccine against spinal cord

2177
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:56,200
At present, many of these groups are studying

2178
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,960
This is mainly for what we call the so-called

2179
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:09,900
It's GPRN, it's the staff members of these five churches who have base eyes

2180
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:15,200
Then go to develop, to fight against this bad deed

2181
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:19,200
That is also currently under development.

2182
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,200
It's finally the seventh

2183
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,200
This one is about Tanghe philosophy

2184
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,200
a personal servant

2185
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
Everyone because in this academic research

2186
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Often we just sometimes run into the fact that we have geometric layers

2187
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,200
When Teacher Liao Juncheng taught us before

2188
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:46,200
The first one, the first thing I thought of was carbon six four

2189
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,200
This is because the speaker in Germany is a football player

2190
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,200
So this is a thoughtful molecule, everyone knows

2191
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,200
I didn't just talk about the structure of a hall

2192
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,200
Is this the expression

2193
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,200
Then we have a plan

2194
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:07,000
There is a class of artistic molecules that is your link pill

2195
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:15,000
How do you connect it with another link pill with a carbon carbon piece with a big V?

2196
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
If you can connect, then this is an artist

2197
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Yes or no

2198
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Look out, friends

2199
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:31,000
This kind of artist so far only has this

2200
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Quads of this we're after QBEN

2201
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
This one was made by a synthetic chemist

2202
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
This is done by a professor from the National Education University

2203
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
the best

2204
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
other these

2205
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
3 sides, 5 sides, 6 sides, 7 sides, a little bit of this can't be done

2206
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
so far

2207
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Then this is a big challenge for us to synthesize

2208
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Then I feel very inaccurate

2209
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,260
But I'm thinking that my genetics can't change

2210
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:04,660
can i use another way

2211
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:06,540
Then you see

2212
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:12,860
We all figured out how to make this carton paper

2213
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:17,340
See if we can make hexagons because of this need

2214
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,940
Our height can vary

2215
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:23,100
Then the pattern above can be changed

2216
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,300
then here everyone

2217
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:27,140
my personal feeling

2218
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:29,300
we do bomb science

2219
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,900
it's sweeter

2220
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:34,460
then origami is fun

2221
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,660
Origami is like doing research

2222
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:39,740
each different shape

2223
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:46,140
The length of its side is related to this

2224
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:49,700
Still need some math to understand

2225
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:51,540
So three sides, four sides, five sides

2226
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,540
Different polygons have different relationships

2227
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:55,540
Then this is a triangle relationship

2228
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,140
that's ok

2229
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,780
A piece of paper can fold a fit

2230
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,500
Another piece of paper can cover a box lid

2231
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:08,500
we can shade various polygons

2232
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:12,000
Everyone, this kindness

2233
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,500
I also spent ten years

2234
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,000
just got it out

2235
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Now you can do all kinds of different polygons

2236
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
in theory

2237
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Can also do 7, 8, 9, 10

2238
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Samples I can bring today

2239
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
that is

2240
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:39,000
this is carton paper

2241
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
means you can open

2242
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
a box body

2243
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
The other is the lid

2244
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Then there can be different polygons

2245
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I brought three today

2246
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Two to three, our vice president

2247
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
668 orders

2248
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Thanks

2249
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,400
Another one I'm of course leaving me with a question

2250
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:05,900
I want to ask everyone

2251
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,700
Give him the right answer

2252
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,300
so when there is a problem

2253
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:13,700
so this is

2254
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,100
I personally think that this is a

2255
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,700
to the elderly

2256
01:33:17,700 --> 01:33:20,900
You can watch your Mosha nerves

2257
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:25,000
This change above is something you can think about every day

2258
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,500
So I think the problem that the old people have now

2259
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:27,700
more and more

2260
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,200
this is a pretty good one

2261
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,500
so everyone

2262
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,300
What you see here are a few simple

2263
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,200
you know i have done all kinds of different

2264
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,800
I have printed it out

2265
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:39,700
There are some

2266
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:40,800
You are also interested

2267
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,500
you are interested to see

2268
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,900
I've been wanting to say

2269
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:44,000
Publisher of our hospital

2270
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:47,200
It's all about literature

2271
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,500
can you say this

2272
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,200
i never knew

2273
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:50,300
because i do science

2274
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:51,300
I never dared to ask

2275
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:55,100
Because I'm afraid of being talked about by the hospital, it's not as good as a job

2276
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,700
I want to say am I

2277
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,000
You can use Saturday and Sunday

2278
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,700
want to say half water

2279
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
so those outside

2280
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,500
Amount that can sell this paper

2281
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,500
But it seems that it is not bad to ask for a piece

2282
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,000
yes, this is

2283
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I'll see how it works as soon as I talk

2284
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,500
A book that can be covered first

2285
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,500
this is my current wish

2286
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,000
but because it has been

2287
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
It's ugly like I took it

2288
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
If you look at the picture they took

2289
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
you can take beautiful pictures

2290
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,500
that this is a person

2291
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,000
a purely personal interest

2292
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:27,500
so i conclude

2293
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,500
what we are talking about today

2294
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,500
seven themes

2295
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,500
and then

2296
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,500
From the general introduction to the final

2297
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,500
This masking aspect

2298
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:39,500
that this

2299
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,500
I finally want to thank you

2300
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,000
listen very patiently

2301
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,500
Because it's really a cold scene

2302
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,500
one and a half hours

2303
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,500
So if there are two slides

2304
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,500
want to share with you

2305
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,500
that one is

2306
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:53,500
Qipenjiao

2307
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,500
this is

2308
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,500
Our Ziyi State Security Officer in Taiwan

2309
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,500
thank you very much

2310
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,800
We walked in the courtyard of the old courtyard

2311
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,500
Is there an ecological stone opposite the Biochemical Institute?

2312
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:12,500
There was a chessboard corner

2313
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:14,500
checkerboard corner

2314
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:18,000
Have you seen it?

2315
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,700
that's really beautiful

2316
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:20,800
and only open at night

2317
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,800
It's like setting off fireworks when it's on.

2318
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,500
So if you guys are going to end up walking over

2319
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,000
is it blooming now

2320
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,500
The other one is more special

2321
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:38,500
is a walker about this technological advancement

2322
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:40,500
this is my personal feeling

2323
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,500
Said a word to me Da Ying Shi Tan

2324
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:47,500
He said he was hot on the day that technology will tear down the moon and human interaction

2325
01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:51,500
The world will become the age of idiots

2326
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,500
Guys, this thing is with us now

2327
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:57,000
already found

2328
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Regardless of the construction vehicle

2329
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
regardless of writing luck

2330
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,540
Even from the MRT, from this line, you have to change to another line

2331
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:08,840
That person can still look down the stairs and up the stairs like this

2332
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:13,060
I really admire him, he is not afraid to bump into

2333
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:16,040
Then this has become an eyeful

2334
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:20,220
When I formed that, what was it that I was discussing?

2335
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:22,920
Discuss the so-called Internet idiom certificate

2336
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:26,160
Then it's like taking drugs

2337
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,260
to that music venue

2338
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:30,260
can borrow

2339
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:33,260
I've connected like this

2340
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:36,260
So like we shared doing a lot of the same period of popular school avoidance

2341
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:40,260
will happen in the next five to ten years

2342
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:44,260
In the past two years, I heard that the ophthalmologist's life is very good.

2343
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:47,260
The glasses store sells a lot

2344
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:49,260
What is the next one? The next one is avoidance

2345
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:52,260
Because that's what children face

2346
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:56,260
I'm exaggerating a bit more, I also saw a mother pushing a music

2347
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,260
you are asleep

2348
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,260
In front of the music there is a

2349
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
He just touched there one by one.

2350
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's in there

2351
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
He slowly took one himself

2352
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I see it

2353
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
how could he do this

2354
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
this is really

2355
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
i think

2356
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
if i can't deny

2357
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Is the progress of the computer is really

2358
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
very important nothing wrong

2359
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
but

2360
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
nothing is

2361
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
hope not to overdo it

2362
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
overused words

2363
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Actually to the end

2364
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
only our own body

2365
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
I want to share this with you

2366
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
thank you all thank you

2367
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
We are very grateful to Professor Hong

2368
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Red Clear Rescue

2369
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
great introduction to us

2370
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
This Tang Dynasty is interesting

2371
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
He today no matter from the scientific point of view

2372
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
From an artistic point of view

2373
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Or from the perspective of disease prevention

2374
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
from a therapeutic perspective

2375
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
also give us a lot

2376
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
such a valuable knowledge

2377
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
actually listen to people

2378
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
watch this with you

2379
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
iPhone iPad 3.0

2380
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,500
that kind of thing is very different

2381
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,500
is that we have good human-to-human interaction

2382
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,500
What about after the appointment?

2383
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:12,000
Of course we also hope that everyone and our generals

2384
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Have better Q&A interaction

2385
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,500
I don't know if you have any questions

2386
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:17,500
come to ask

2387
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,000
Haolai Zhou Yueqing

2388
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
ask the professor

2389
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Thank you so much

2390
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,500
it was a very good speech

2391
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:29,000
I come every month to listen to something as brilliant as this rarely

2392
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,500
Thanks

2393
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:33,000
ask the professor

2394
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
my question is simple

2395
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
and you please don't scare me

2396
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,500
but i want to know

2397
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:42,000
The professor just mentioned dried inulin

2398
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
That is to say, you eat the leaves and they are very sweet

2399
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
non-toxic and harmless

2400
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,500
can we use dried inulin leaves

2401
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:55,500
In place of that sugar heaven

2402
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:57,500
is now used

2403
01:38:57,500 --> 01:39:00,500
I think it should be possible now Tianju Tang

2404
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,920
In fact, in Japan or in the mainland, they have to extract

2405
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:07,120
I am selling this Tianjutang exclusively

2406
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,760
In Taiwan, you actually go online to report what happened in Tianjutang

2407
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,400
You can also find agents

2408
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,160
So you can actually buy

2409
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:20,200
But that means the Department of Health may not have announced it positively.

2410
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,000
so that everyone can use more

2411
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,680
If you go to the flower market to buy leaves to eat

2412
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,600
It's okay to be in the south

2413
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,320
In fact, the sweetness is of course not as sweet as it is stored

2414
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,760
It means that if you eat it, you will feel a sweet taste in your mouth, there is nothing wrong with it

2415
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:38,200
But it's not as sweet as extracted, isn't it?

2416
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,520
Yes, what is extracted is what is stored

2417
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,320
Thank you and the second question

2418
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:46,200
It's the hay that your professor mentioned just now

2419
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:49,680
So if hay is good for the body too

2420
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:55,360
Buying hay flakes will make tea and you feel very dry

2421
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,600
I am studying medicine myself.

2422
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,960
Yes, because many people will talk about this balance

2423
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
So I still suggest that you can ask a Chinese doctor to see

2424
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Because it depends on your physique whether it is suitable for this kind of thing

2425
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Because some people have different constitutions, some are hot and some are cold.

2426
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Thank you Jiaqi

2427
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
ok who else

2428
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
come welcome sir please

2429
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
sorry for the viewers

2430
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Then I think that several years ago we read in a newspaper in Taiwan that

2431
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
the british said to the newspaper

2432
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
There is a universal vaccine for influenza A

2433
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,000
But when I saw that news about three or four years ago, there was no follow-up

2434
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Then I think a question is to say

2435
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
All of the influenza A does it have some missing pieces

2436
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It is an invariant and has antigenic properties

2437
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Then I don’t know you just mentioned that there are so many H and H and there are so many N

2438
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
and so much more

2439
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Every now and then a new type A flu

2440
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
We're scared to death

2441
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
even water

2442
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It is possible that in the section of new material research

2443
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Find books from the structure of carbohydrates

2444
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Type A parts can

2445
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
It can be said to be a marker for the basis of my vaccine development

2446
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
If so, will something like this be developed in the future?

2447
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Don't be afraid of newcomers coming out

2448
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
It's ok to call first

2449
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
so that's my idea thanks

2450
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Thank you

2451
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Because it's everyone's dream

2452
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I hope you can find the so-called

2453
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
broad-spectrum vaccine

2454
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
can beat everything

2455
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
words here

2456
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Most of the previous research and development was aimed at

2457
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
You just talked about a half-blank paper here

2458
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So are you able to find

2459
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
a common sequence

2460
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
you target that sequence

2461
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
is the development antibody

2462
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
make a vaccine

2463
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
This is the way it used to be

2464
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Use this type to find

2465
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
but that means

2466
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Can cohabitation be found?

2467
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Can do a better sequence

2468
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
this is a problem

2469
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Our dean is doing it

2470
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Our dean and horse test

2471
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
one of the things they do is say

2472
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
This Timaru Dilim

2473
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
He actually has a lot of these on the surface

2474
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
N-Guy icon

2475
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
They found that light

2476
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
If you come out like this

2477
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Go to indus N-Guy body

2478
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Because those N-Guy icons are big

2479
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
or cover up

2480
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
will cover him

2481
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So that N-Guy body's

2482
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It's definitely not that good of a choice.

2483
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
the hydrolyzed protein

2484
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Those N-Guy icons cut off

2485
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Cut off leaving only one sugar

2486
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
is the first candy

2487
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
It's NGuy CO-Gay Glucosamine

2488
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
The sugar is still on the egg white

2489
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
They found that this is how

2490
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Glycoprotein

2491
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
then that

2492
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
when antibodies come

2493
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
it can

2494
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
identifiable

2495
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Many antibodies recognize egg vesicles

2496
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Such a glycoprotein

2497
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Today it doesn't matter how much H you are

2498
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,240
Many and few of those sugar egg lilies

2499
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:03,740
Because Englekensla watch those many different

2500
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:05,560
But you cut off the exterior

2501
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:07,560
As long as the most basic sugar in it

2502
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:09,560
that's all the same

2503
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:11,560
So they are developing now, that is to say

2504
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,560
Can this thing be made universal?

2505
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,560
Universal's Vaccine

2506
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:22,560
This is what our dean is currently doing with that teacher Ma Fang.

2507
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,560
Well, of course everyone knows this.

2508
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,560
You come out with a sexual concept of any thing

2509
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:31,620
Then after many visual tests

2510
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:33,620
I don't know if they have already transferred the record to the company

2511
01:43:33,620 --> 01:43:37,620
But that is to say, has it entered clinical trials?

2512
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:41,620
Might have to wait for further news

2513
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:43,620
After all, we hope that our dean will not be told by him

2514
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:44,620
right

2515
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:46,620
This is mainly

2516
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:48,620
This is mainly to say that it really didn't work out.

2517
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:50,620
Definitely not mentioned by him

2518
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:52,620
I can tell you like this

2519
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:54,620
But this thing just takes time

2520
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,680
we're going to push

2521
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,680
good

2522
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,680
come to a mirror

2523
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:08,000
May I ask why the cranberry has no effect after adding Liposong?

2524
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:17,000
I found it on two roads, but I don't know how, it is the benchmark of its function

2525
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Because of course it is possible to bring this little Ami's comparative comfort

2526
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
So it can be packaged by Liposong, so it can be brought in

2527
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:34,000
In Taiwan, I know a company that is doing Weiss, and now the stock has been rising recently

2528
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Because it is the part of the application that seems to be pretty good

2529
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But I don't know the real function benchmark, sorry

2530
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Don't forget I just had a question for you guys

2531
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
If you have any questions, we will ask Teacher Hong to ask questions

2532
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
He will give you this beautiful elbow

2533
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
May I

2534
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:02,000
still have a question

2535
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
i'm not a problem

2536
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I also want to add to what I just said about Liposong

2537
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Because someone who supplements Liposong will receive cancer cell

2538
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Less likely to receive normal cell

2539
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Because many neuroparticles have this characteristic

2540
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Then if he does not receive normal cells

2541
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
It will have fewer side effects

2542
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Thank you for our director's supplement

2543
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
this is a very important thing

2544
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Come on, demonstrate a problem

2545
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I'm curious

2546
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Talking about the C2 acid of poisonous starch

2547
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
followed by back dripping C2 acid

2548
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Why add this dropwise C2 acid

2549
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
what chemical reaction

2550
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Let it taste more Q

2551
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
what structure is causing this feeling

2552
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I didn't discuss this

2553
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I will ask the master who made this starch

2554
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Professor Wang

2555
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,500
He has to apply for a patent

2556
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,200
then later failed

2557
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:05,880
These are the best

2558
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:06,920
if pass everywhere

2559
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:07,920
This is terrible

2560
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,380
the reason behind this

2561
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:13,760
I didn't show up first

2562
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:14,760
yes

2563
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,200
ask a question

2564
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,520
even if it makes sense

2565
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,020
how bad

2566
01:46:19,020 --> 01:46:20,360
I seem to see it now

2567
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:24,060
Eating naked eyes is like being completely dead

2568
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:27,800
Some so-called over-standard

2569
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,080
But what about passing the bid?

2570
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,040
Are you going to do good?

2571
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:32,560
this is

2572
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,280
Of course, there is an announcement from the Department of Health

2573
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,720
That is how much weight per day

2574
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,520
probably can say

2575
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,560
how much is that

2576
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:42,040
But I feel that is the highest standard

2577
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:42,560
but everyone

2578
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,040
There are always several kinds of food you eat every day

2579
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,600
But so many additions

2580
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:47,920
a lot of these

2581
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,880
This is not the only one

2582
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:50,680
so here

2583
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:52,440
In fact, if you are outside

2584
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,920
can buy books

2585
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,640
so-called food additives

2586
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,760
Have you seen this book

2587
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,760
there is a japanese

2588
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,700
So inside the job ended up he wrote a book

2589
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:07,580
is the thing that unmasks these food additives

2590
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:09,540
this word is

2591
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:12,640
at present

2592
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:15,880
That is to say, poison experts on the side of Long Roots.

2593
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:19,820
what he did he did with that animal

2594
01:47:19,820 --> 01:47:22,500
He found out that he was not good for his kidneys

2595
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,160
It's not good for the kidneys, so he concluded that

2596
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:29,080
If you take too much of this stuff

2597
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:31,240
permanent damage to the kidneys

2598
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:34,240
That's why he proposed that he would do kidney dialysis

2599
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:38,080
But our Sun Yuxuan

2600
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,320
Dean's daughter Sun Yuxuan

2601
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:45,360
Professor Sun Yuxuan

2602
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,920
He is a professor at the National Taiwan University Laboratory

2603
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,200
He brought up another one that he felt

2604
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:53,200
That is the difference between animals and people

2605
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,300
So people's words don't seem to be that serious

2606
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:59,560
So he thinks that further research is needed

2607
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Let's see if it's really possible

2608
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,000
right

2609
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
but still

2610
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
always more than a word

2611
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,000
I feel like saying

2612
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,000
many things should not be added

2613
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
should not be added

2614
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
But the manufacturer is

2615
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
want to make money

2616
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
so he'll add these things

2617
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
But I feel like saying

2618
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
our government

2619
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
we are sometimes

2620
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Tai easy compromise

2621
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
just by you

2622
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,000
in order to compromise

2623
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
is about to become a

2624
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
The so-called allowable range

2625
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
This makes people feel

2626
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
doesn't seem so good

2627
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
because of that tolerance

2628
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
it will sometimes be blurry

2629
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
So like social gold

2630
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Originally it was fixed and could not be added

2631
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
what's going on now

2632
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
How many PPTs are available

2633
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
right

2634
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Is that mountain giant Qingan there?

2635
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Plasticizer

2636
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
toxic starch

2637
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Guess why next

2638
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Excuse me

2639
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
that's for the eyes

2640
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
your eyes

2641
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,560
It's also easy to pick one by one

2642
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:08,360
So I think this is really a big problem.

2643
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:14,060
ok if there are no other questions

2644
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:17,360
Let's now invite Professor Huang to ask us questions

2645
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,060
ok, simple question

2646
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:24,160
Everyone, I just mentioned SARS, right?

2647
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:28,760
SARS outbreak expected in 2003

2648
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,520
This year is also a better tenth anniversary

2649
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,720
Did everyone forget

2650
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,320
You said who has the government computer?

2651
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,120
Let's mention this matter

2652
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:38,920
but you know what

2653
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:42,960
Back in 2003 we were in front of the TV

2654
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,820
It was really troublesome at that time

2655
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:47,060
I don't know how you feel

2656
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:49,060
I saw a face at that time

2657
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:50,720
appear on tv

2658
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,760
then tell us this stuff

2659
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,360
How should you prevent

2660
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,420
right, you should have a fever

2661
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:59,520
It's contagious because he has a fever, right?

2662
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:07,000
You can't go to public places, and you have raised the so-called 2 seconds to enter a public place, is that right?

2663
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:20,000
At that time, Taiwan had the least number of hospital patients, and it was the cleanest time, because everyone wore masks, and it was really the best time

2664
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Do you still remember the vulgar chief? You raised your hand, high school student, do you want to hurry up and put the second

2665
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
right

2666
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
right

2667
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,960
If at that time someone told me there was no such thing

2668
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,200
and then to solve

2669
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,600
I don't want to die

2670
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:08,400
At that time, the whole has really spread.

2671
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,200
But let me add

2672
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,400
this person is not important

2673
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,600
the most important thing is each of you

2674
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,200
Each of you has two body temperatures

2675
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:17,800
There are measures to cooperate with the government

2676
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:19,800
without the cooperation of the people

2677
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,600
this person has nothing

2678
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,800
but i really thank you

2679
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:27,000
The teacher also accepts this gift from me very much.

2680
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Now I don't know how to speak

2681
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
But we are very grateful

2682
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Professor Hong gave us a wonderful speech

2683
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Just what you told the classmates who watched us

2684
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
we have a lot of speeches

2685
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
this is deep for me

2686
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
And everyone can understand

2687
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,000
And then have a good understanding of Don

2688
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
thanks again

2689
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Professor Hong's speech to us

2690
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Thanks

2691
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,060
you
