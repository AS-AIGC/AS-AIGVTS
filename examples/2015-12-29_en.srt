1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100

2
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,800
We truly wish all of our cordial brothers and sisters

3
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,000
that fullyrs advocate for the restoration.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,100
Central Surgeon Center responds veryupply

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,560
to the

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:53,800
Paul Davis's discourse.

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Pieters perhaps learn about

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Welcome to the last feast of knowledge this year

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,840
So today's speaker, Dr. Lin Jiwen

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,640
Researcher and Director of the Institute of Political Science

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,040
So he graduated from the Institute of Political Science, Department of Political Science, National Taiwan University?

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,760
also have

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,360
Then, in 1996, UCLA awarded a Ph.D. degree in political science from this branch of the University of California

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,640
then he is

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,040
Taiwan's youth is the most famous political scientist I think

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,880
Then it is the wild lily generation in the broad sense of this wild lily

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:50,640
Then his greatest interest is to understand why human beings establish norms to limit their freedom

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,600
Why do humans establish norms to limit their freedom

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,960
Is it for greater freedom or for one group of people to dominate another

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The answer to this question is of course very complex

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to answer this question

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Dr Lin's Research Interests

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Include the formal model

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
including comparative political systems

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and East Asian politics

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and covers abstraction

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Theoretical and local

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Professor Lin's academic performance is very good

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He also passed the National Science Council

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Contact Home Now

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Once a modeler of political science

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
he has two books

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Papers are published in good Chinese and foreign journals

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Including Politics, Journal of Democracy

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
China Quarterly

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Etc., etc

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
he was a very accomplished political scientist

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
At the same time, he also endows theoretical thinking

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
development of realpolitik

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
also have very unique insights

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We have business talks with him every once in a while

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Only then do I understand what Taiwan is now

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
what's going on in politics

44
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,900
including when we ate

45
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,900
so that i can understand a little bit

46
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,000
understand a little bit

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,300
because i'm a historian

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,400
history won't run away

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
history won't run away

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
history is always there

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,800
so but politics is different

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,200
different politics

53
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
politics it has been evolving

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
inattentive

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,200
within a month

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,400
One thing can change Taiwan's political

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Landscape changes it all

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,400
and it's changing very fast

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,200
especially now social media

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,600
Often a thing is not dealt with for a few days

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
the whole situation changes

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
So this gets really fast

63
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
become very fast

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
so every once in a while

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm going to get close

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
I think the analysis is very accurate

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,000
and theoretically valuable

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
listen to what they have to say

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Then take a look at the political situation in Taiwan

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,800
And your director is the most important one

71
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,300
we applaud now

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,000
come and welcome his speech today

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,900
Thanks

74
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,800
i think i have to introduce myself first

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
This is so-called popular science

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Then you should know who I am

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Then I want to introduce Wang Fu just now

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Young Scholars

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
It's actually very simple because there is no

80
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
So I'm the first and the last

81
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,800
because how to say

82
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
when i got my doctorate

83
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,400
I was probably the first to run back to Taiwan

84
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
so no one else so simple

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,800
ok

86
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,400
then i want to introduce myself first

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,200
when i was in high school

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
In middle school and high school

89
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
my favorite is english class

90
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
my favorite is language

91
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,800
So I would choose the Department of Politics

92
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
The international relations group is actually very simple

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
I didn't even think about going into academia

94
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
then i want to be a diplomat

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
it's easy

96
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,400
High school students want to be diplomats

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,200
I think being a diplomat is so much fun.

98
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,400
That was after I entered the political department

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,200
I regret the first study

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
why do you regret

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,200
I found Taiwan's diplomacy

102
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,800
Countries with diplomatic relations are not there

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,000
my seniors and sisters

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's just that after entering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it's very hard.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have a good senior

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He said you are now in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mr. Li Bin, what are you doing?

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He said it was hard work

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
say what are you doing

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He said I was opening the menu

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
what menu

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He said because at that time

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
we still have a lot

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
that diplomatic relationship is in the middle east

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He said I'm going to notice

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The first one is after I open the menu

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
can't let them see me

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because i'm female

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What about the second one? Those menus are horrible.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Anyway, no need to describe

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You probably know what menu he serves

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
then he left

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So what I mean is

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The so-called political science is actually quite complicated

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But what we thought at the time

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
very simple

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just think I'm going to study political science

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm going to be a diplomat in the future

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Later, I found out that this road can't go on.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Then I passed by

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Return to Academia Sinica after several years

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I found that the average person's interest in political science

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Still have an interesting idea

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He said how could political science be called science?

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
right

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You should all still have this question now

137
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How can political science be a science

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We all know that in the humanities and social sciences

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
will put their own subjects

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Science is only political science

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,480
English called Political Science

142
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,160
then nothing else

143
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,960
What about others?

144
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,640
not so inferior

145
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,360
because we have to claim we're doing political science

146
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,360
The second one is that many scholars

147
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,320
When you think that political science is not a science

148
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,960
So just talk about your theory

149
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:20,960
ok

150
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,040
That is to say, if politics is not science

151
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,520
So you're really like a humanities history?

152
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,320
It seems not

153
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,200
then we are in a very awkward position

154
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,480
Then I think this impression is still quite deep.

155
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,520
that's talking

156
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,280
Many people will say, why do you study political science?

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,320
ok

158
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,520
Like my mother asked me what are you studying in political science?

159
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,840
If you don't run for president, what are you going to do?

160
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,160
ok

161
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,440
I said I was doing learning, how did he do good research

162
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,200
So now many people's impression of political science comes from Taiwan's education issues

163
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,960
Because we were divided into two groups in high school

164
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,120
Wen Group and Li Group

165
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,960
Well, we now have research that proves that

166
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,960
He showed that in fact the group book of the high school

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
is a bad thing

168
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,540
Why

169
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Because it will make the person in the selection team

170
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,740
I feel bad at math

171
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,340
actually that's wrong

172
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,040
I remember being very impressed when I was a freshman

173
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,440
That is to say, among my classmates

174
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,400
many people he said

175
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
I finally don't have to study math anymore.

176
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,540
Many students in the literary group are like this, right?

177
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,740
I know many of you feel this way

178
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,340
Good thing I don't have to study math anymore

179
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,040
It gives me a headache to see that loss

180
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,740
Many of my classmates are like this

181
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,400
That's why you really want to study political science.

182
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,540
you will find a very interesting thing

183
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,800
That is to say

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
A topic I want to share with you today

185
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,740
that is

186
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,260
How many look here

187
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,640
sorry

188
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,400
Because I am used to writing in English

189
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll translate it

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,200
so-called political science

191
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,700
with statistics and game theory

192
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,240
Wait a minute and I'll introduce what game theory is

193
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,040
what does it matter

194
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,900
OK

195
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,040
so i put the question first

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,140
mean to say

197
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,200
statistics

198
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,040
Strategy

199
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,940
The most important thing is that game theory is talking about Strategy

200
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
and political science

201
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,180
It's probably the core issue

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
authority

203
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,700
So what's the relationship between these three?

204
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
Of course you'd think he had nothing to do with it.

205
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,400
Actually he has nothing to do

206
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
But I think you look at it from a historical perspective

207
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
You'll find out that he's not only related

208
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
and a very close relationship

209
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,600
OK so today I am very

210
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,200
The purpose of the thousand generations is to let everyone know one thing

211
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,300
That is to say, political science in the so-called social sciences

212
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,300
The statistics that everyone is talking about now

213
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,000
game theory

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,200
His relationship is very close

215
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,400
even the closeness of his relationship

216
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,000
more than other disciplines

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
ok then let's see

218
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,400
Few people know who this man is

219
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,500
I was chatting with Deputy Wang when we were eating

220
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,900
His name is Fal Noyman

221
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,400
John Fal Noyman

222
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,900
So what do you think these three things are related to?

223
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,600
one is to do

224
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,500
One is to make yourself very powerful

225
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,900
OK you have a lot to do

226
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,500
Only then can I become a very powerful person

227
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
But you need to understand statistics

228
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,900
then you have to understand

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This Game Theory game theory

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe I'll think of this guy Fornoyman

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can't finish the story about Fornoyman

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
he is a very interesting person

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
because he is so famous

234
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Inventing new things all the time

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
so he didn't win any awards

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
ok

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
one of his most famous examples

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
of course that means

239
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
if you have heard

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The so-called bland project H Bomb

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
he is a very important person

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
ok

243
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He's in a light plan

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Fornoyman he probably played

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
very important role

246
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then what

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Does he have anything to do with statistics?

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I need you to check his academic background

249
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Of course he's had some experience with statistics.

250
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
because he's a mathematician at heart

251
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There must be a problem with statistics

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So you're saying what does he have to do with game theory?

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
should say so

254
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If we take Fornoyman's name off

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
no light in game

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
so he's so funny

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because he is in many fields

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
he is the founder

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But what?

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
because of him

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The real interest is actually mathematics itself

262
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So like Game Theory for him

263
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
just a novel

264
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,960
He went to write a book when he wrote about it

265
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,280
It has something to do with the game we are talking about today.

266
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,440
Fornoiman

267
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,320
That's why he died young

268
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,160
when i died

269
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,520
Why

270
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,680
Because he participated in the light program

271
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,920
so at that time

272
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,120
Scientists of about the same generation as him

273
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,240
probably die earlier

274
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,960
I didn't have that feeling at that time

275
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,000
It means that you participate in the light program

276
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
It's actually a very dangerous thing

277
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
so he died early

278
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,800
OK so Fornoyman

279
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,360
then we have to look through him

280
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,400
Are these three things related?

281
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,320
So I asked a question below

282
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,880
that is

283
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,120
statistics

284
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,920
Match

285
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,320
politics

286
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,680
just rely on such a person

287
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,800
can we link it together?

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
the answer is of course no

289
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
because this is a very interesting person

290
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,760
we can connect it

291
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,440
Then we will now look at the relationship between these three

292
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,160
i think it should

293
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,440
From the next point of view

294
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,800
where does statistics come from

295
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,120
we want to ask a historic question

296
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
where does statistics come from

297
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I deliberately inserted the answer first

298
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
OK what is the answer

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
take a look

300
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
let me ask you a question first

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
what is statistics in english

302
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you know

303
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Statistics in English is statistics

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Have you ever thought

305
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What does this statistics mean

306
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
this word is very long

307
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and very convoluted

308
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
right

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
it's there

310
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The current Latin is called statisticoon

311
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
it's the same

312
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
from statistics

313
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
extend out

314
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
have you ever thought

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why is it called statistics

316
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
ok now tell everyone

317
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
because it's math for politics

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So statistics

319
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is to measure your country

320
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
so it's political science

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
from political science

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
OK, many people think that

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
how could this be

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
we hear now

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Statistics seem to be

326
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
what mathematicians are doing

327
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How to start with political science

328
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
have you ever thought about this

329
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Look at the book below that was published in 1663

330
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
就是The Nature and Political Observations upon the Bill of Mortality

331
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Its author is called John Grunt

332
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Published in 1663

333
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is probably the first

334
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The first book compares contemporary

335
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The more modern concept of so-called statistics

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
wrote it out

337
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
what does it talk about

338
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it's about nature and politics

339
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Mortality from the point of view of nature and politics

340
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If you do demography or statistics

341
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
maybe you should know

342
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
John Grunt is very important

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
1663

344
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We can imagine that in 1663 in

345
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
when is china

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Late Ming Dynasty Early Qing Dynasty

347
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
is there such a person

348
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
seems difficult

349
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
but he has written a

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
everyone noticed

351
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
One of his keywords is Political

352
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
so it becomes

353
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The word statistics at the beginning

354
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
originally political science

355
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
then the first

356
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Comparing modern approaches to writing statistics

357
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,100
This book of statistics

358
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,720
It has a word called Protocolic

359
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,820
So stop saying that political science is not science

360
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,400
because statistics comes before all science

361
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,900
it starts with political science

362
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,500
I'm really kidding

363
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,400
I said statistics

364
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,620
we all know now

365
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,020
The most basic concept of statistics is that

366
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,720
you have a mother

367
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,820
right, there is a mother body

368
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,100
Then I sampled from the matrix

369
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,860
Then I'm going to look at the sampling process

370
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,160
is it random

371
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,360
So I just take a thousand more samples

372
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,680
I can infer

373
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,180
Infer what the mother's body is likely to be like

374
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,420
You may have thought of one thing

375
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,720
Where was statistics first used?

376
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,780
population

377
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,720
what is population in english

378
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,680
It's called Population

379
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,260
Do you understand?

380
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,880
That is to say, we now say that the matrix

381
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Actually sorry to say

382
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,980
It originally meant population

383
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,980
then i will tell you a story

384
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,380
that is

385
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Let me tell you one

386
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,580
In fact, there is no concrete evidence to show the story

387
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,080
but i think it should be like that

388
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,900
think about it

389
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries

390
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries

391
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
who is interested in that

392
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
who has that resource

393
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
To find out how many people he managed

394
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
king

395
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then what

396
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
he will want to say

397
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
How can I use the lowest cost

398
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
minimum cost

399
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
To know how many people I have here

400
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
what to do

401
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
to war

402
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
know what i mean

403
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
because you look like

404
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries

405
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
basically in the

406
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
in a state of war

407
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
then you can think of one thing

408
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
that is to say this thing

409
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
a king

410
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He can know how many people he has

411
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
can fight

412
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
how much tax can he collect

413
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
so as not to cause riots

414
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That way he's more likely to win

415
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So he hates war

416
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
so you know what to say

417
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The concept of statistics

418
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
In fact, he is in the modern country

419
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
in the process of forming

420
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
a very strong false

421
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that is, if I could know

422
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
if i could know

423
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,500
what method do i use

424
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,000
can maximize my benefits

425
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I have a chance to win

426
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So you can immediately imagine a thing

427
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That is to say, what do these kings do?

428
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
i'm imagining

429
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,500
Maybe this existed in some time and space very early

430
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
What he does is actually very simple

431
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
For example, I brought my Dacheng

432
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,500
Find 20 Dacheng

433
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
He said you should at least go now

434
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to my territory to see

435
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
what to see

436
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
how many people do you see

437
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And you can't two people go to the same place

438
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
right he might have a map over here

439
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
when the time comes you will look around

440
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then you take what you see

441
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
come back and talk to me

442
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That process is called random sampling

443
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
OK, so random sampling means

444
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You see the population I rule

445
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is called the motif

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
OK then you sample it yourself

447
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
come back and report to me

448
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
the one who can do it

449
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He actually has a higher chance of winning.

450
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
OK so everyone understands

451
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That is to say, statistics, he actually

452
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,400
His origin is not mysterious at all

453
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,900
He was measuring your territory

454
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,600
OK

455
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,400
let me say it again by the way

456
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,600
Let's talk about that later

457
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
John Grunt's story

458
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,400
the book he wrote

459
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,000
He is studying the death of the population of London

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,400
That's because there was a very important issue happening in London at the time.

461
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,000
called meaning

462
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,300
Interested

463
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,800
So he called Protocol Observations

464
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,000
Which means you have to give him a political observation

465
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900
Why

466
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,700
Because I was very interested in such research at the time

467
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,500
because you think about being a king

468
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,600
He's actually in Chouse II

469
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,500
Huse II

470
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,300
That British history itself is very complicated

471
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,300
But the king of England at that time was called Chouse II

472
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,700
II

473
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,500
Then there is a great need for someone to do this kind of research

474
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Why

475
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
Because mortality is probably the foundation of a regime

476
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,100
if your rule

477
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,500
your population is dead

478
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,000
what do you rule

479
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,700
so the first thing he does

480
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,000
Is it possible to pass through

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Such research to understand why people die

482
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,100
Or these British subjects below us

483
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
What is the average life expectancy

484
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
So he must be using statistics

485
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,000
He must be using statistics

486
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,100
and then tell my readers to say

487
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,700
How much is our mortality rate the first

488
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,900
For example, how many people in a thousand people will die?

489
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,500
for what reason

490
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,600
And then of course this involves his investigation.

491
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,900
Then I can also describe

492
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,800
For example, the average population of the city of London at that time

493
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,700
What is the life expectancy

494
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,900
So this is a very important work

495
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
downground

496
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,400
That

497
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,500
Of course later

498
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,600
This matter was followed by other scholars.

499
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,700
The statistics we now know better

500
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Actually it was later

501
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
But he started out to find out where you rule

502
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
so the other day i heard that kurpi

503
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,100
He said something that I found quite interesting

504
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,900
He said there would be no governance without statistics

505
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,600
nothing wrong

506
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,500
because he is a doctor

507
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,400
statistics are important

508
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,100
Like you don't even know you're in

509
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
rule where

510
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You don't understand how you manage it

511
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
there's nothing wrong with that

512
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Well, then of course it means

513
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We are more impressed by these

514
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Theoretical development with statistics

515
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Of course the mathematicians are starting to creep in

516
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
For example, there are quite a few famous people mentioned here.

517
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
For example, one of the most important theories

518
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Chance of course

519
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
probability

520
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Probability is of course a mathematical concept

521
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But you see these people are quite famous

522
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
For example, Baskar and Xianglan

523
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's the one

524
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you know, Ferma?

525
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
should have listened

526
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Is there a math department here?

527
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Institute of Mathematics

528
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
dare not speak

529
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
OK OK

530
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
ferma is famous

531
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Of course these are mathematicians

532
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Then what

533
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Look at that Gauss again

534
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Namely CF Gauss 1794

535
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that his

536
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
knowledge of statistics

537
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That is to say, he builds on a foundation

538
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He said

539
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
when people have to decide

540
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
must face uncertainty

541
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So we're going to find a

542
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The most rational decision-making model

543
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
is to minimize

544
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
face uncertainty

545
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This is a fundamental of statistics

546
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
this concept

547
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That is to say, there must be errors in our statistics.

548
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If you see a paper next time

549
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's my sampling with no error at all

550
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
don't you believe

551
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
ok statistics biggest job

552
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
is to minimize our error

553
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but there must be errors

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay, let's take a look at this guy first.

555
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is John Brown

556
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
this is a very interesting person

557
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He is a Fellow of the Royal Society

558
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He had the Royal Society

559
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's why he wants to be an academician

560
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This thing is taken by many other

561
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Fellows of the Royal Society object

562
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why

563
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Have you ever thought about this question

564
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
please teach me

565
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
why do you think he was opposed

566
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
you don't know him well

567
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
you say you don't know

568
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
you say you say

569
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
not yet

570
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Only he will have statistics in the future

571
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
no that book sold well

572
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,800
for what reason

573
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Have you ever thought about this question

574
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
you hurry up

575
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
so and so

576
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
just speak louder

577
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,800
ok then we should find out

578
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
What were the fellows of the Royal Society doing at the time?

579
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,300
I don't have an answer to this right now

580
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
I don't know. Going to investigate

581
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
out of line

582
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
very good

583
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
This is a political interpretation

584
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
is there any other explanation

585
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
It's about Newton

586
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
should be ok

587
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
but this is fun

588
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
Newton's era should be about the same as his

589
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Yes, but Newton, the founder of the Royal Society, was a little bit older than him.

590
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,300
is there any other answer

591
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
this is very interesting

592
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,300
The first person to write a book on statistics

593
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Why him? Will he object to his entry into the Royal Society?

594
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Why did he enter the Royal Society?

595
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
yes

596
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
he and he is not considered scientific

597
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
In fact, he also saw that you had a Publication at that time.

598
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Right? People with good publications are more likely to

599
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
then you are probably right

600
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you know what his identity is?

601
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Soldiers, at that time many people were called Captain

602
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Below are some Captains

603
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And then it's over, he's an interesting identity.

604
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
he is in the sales department

605
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Because their family moved to London later

606
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
His father is a businessman

607
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That is to say, if you want to make clothes, you need to find his father.

608
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
so he is a businessman

609
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
know what i mean

610
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Then he didn't have any high education

611
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
that's interesting that is to say

612
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He certainly inherited his father's trade

613
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
He is also a salesman

614
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
because we think he's weird

615
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I want to ask Mr. Wang Hu about this

616
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Is it possible that such a person would come out in China at that time?

617
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
unlikely right

618
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Very difficult

619
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,740
Even in the UK, he is opposed by many people

620
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,100
That is to say, how can a businessman enter the Royal Academy?

621
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,520
I don't know that our traditional Chinese medicine hospital is of course much better now.

622
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,660
But I don't know why the British Royal Academy at that time had such

623
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,720
He was actually discriminated against, simply put, discriminated against

624
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,920
Then a friend just mentioned why he went in later, do you know?

625
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,580
I don't know about this, I don't have any evidence, I can't just talk about it

626
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,260
but that book is selling well

627
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,400
It is because the current Chos'a second recommended him to say

628
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
you want to let him in

629
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,320
know what i mean

630
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,640
So it's not that he doesn't fit in with the Dao, but he fits in with the Dao

631
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,120
This is good, politics is always there

632
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,280
That is to say, your relationship with the leader actually has a little influence.

633
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,560
So this is a pretty interesting story

634
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,520
That is to say, we look at it from the perspective of historical eyes

635
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,900
The development of fellow economics, of course he has his

636
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,080
The actual demand is quite strong

637
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,660
Then we saw that the word classmate was meant to measure your country

638
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,240
And then the first statistics textbook was kind of like this thing

639
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,800
In fact, he was talking about politics.

640
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,280
He talks about Mortality

641
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,280
If he wants to enter, the Huang Family Academy will not be able to enter.

642
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,000
But because Chalster II appreciates his

643
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That is to say, you must let him in, and he will go in.

644
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,400
So of course he has a little influence on the later research

645
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,000
We are now reading about the life cycle

646
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
should read this guy

647
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
But his real identity is a cloth seller

648
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
OK so I think it's a funny thing

649
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's look at this question again

650
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Now let's talk about these three things separately.

651
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that's next

652
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We want to say that this is what statistics look like

653
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What is the so-called game?

654
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
In fact, the game theory should not be complicated

655
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
'Cause we're playing games every day

656
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
OK, for example, if you are older, you can play mahjong

657
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
play poker

658
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
the younger man

659
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Maybe as soon as December 31st someone wants to play a board game

660
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
right

661
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
human beings as long as they live

662
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Everyone wants to play some games

663
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,940
In fact, it is called Game Theory, which means game theory.

664
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,020
It is more clearly called Spill Theory in German

665
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,520
Spill means to play

666
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,920
So it's not so mysterious

667
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
So we think of it ourselves as if

668
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,420
like something we don't understand

669
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,260
It's not that mysterious

670
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,760
it means to say

671
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
when we make a decision

672
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,960
If I have several options to choose from

673
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,100
why i choose this method

674
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,400
unselective method

675
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,400
isn't it simple

676
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
now game theory

677
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
The funniest thing about it is

678
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,700
When I'm thinking about what method I'm going to use

679
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,100
You should also consider what other people are thinking

680
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,800
right

681
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,200
Because a really good player

682
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
You must have thought of this

683
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,780
That is to say, if I play this card now

684
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,840
then will you follow

685
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,620
or you will have better cards

686
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,120
right

687
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,780
People who are more good at playing should think about this.

688
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,420
Then I often discuss with my mother

689
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,620
playing mahjong

690
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,260
I feel really great

691
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,020
she is very old

692
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,320
but still played well

693
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,040
She said you really have to know how to play mahjong

694
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,760
You must know what the other three are thinking

695
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,060
or you will lose

696
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,000
this is really awesome

697
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,260
that means

698
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,860
a person who is actually making decisions

699
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,060
He not only has to consider his own interests

700
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,000
consider his own position

701
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,860
Not only should he consider

702
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,760
What kind of decision is better for him

703
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,500
His considerations should include what others are thinking

704
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,960
so everyone can understand

705
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,600
So when it comes to Game Theory

706
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,500
It is actually a core concept

707
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,860
called Common Knowledge

708
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,760
is the consensus

709
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,760
what is consensus

710
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,360
it's me thinking what are you thinking

711
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,960
I know what you're thinking about me

712
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
So when I'm thinking about what you're thinking

713
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,900
i know you know

714
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,760
i know what you're thinking

715
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,160
know what i mean

716
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,060
You know what I'm talking about when you do this

717
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,360
but it means

718
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,160
when i was thinking what is the best solution

719
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,460
I must take into account

720
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,660
What are others thinking about this solution?

721
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,060
Well, this is actually what we do in our daily life.

722
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,860
a frequently encountered situation

723
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,460
Is this good?

724
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,020
OK, for example, during the election

725
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,020
Do you think typing this negative text now

726
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
or he is helpful to you

727
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Then you send negative WeChat

728
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He must have thought of how the other party would fight back.

729
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
is when you take everything into consideration

730
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Maybe that's a thing they call equilibrium

731
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
so

732
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Strategy跟calculation

733
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
This thing was meant to be put together

734
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Then I want to remind you one word

735
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
called Strategy

736
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
OK because when we say

737
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
when we are playing a game

738
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The method I choose is called Strategy

739
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
According to Julien

740
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
what does he call strategy

741
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
what is his name

742
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I remember he seemed to call it a strategy or a strategy

743
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
His is Chao Abe's three strategies

744
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Anyway

745
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
what

746
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
ok ok

747
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
In fact, his English is Strategy

748
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Strategy is an interesting concept

749
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Let's say I'm telling you now

750
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The game is studying Strategy

751
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That is to say, I know several strategies

752
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
English is called strategy

753
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Actually, the first thing you think of is political science.

754
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
right

755
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
The most care in political science is strategy

756
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,100
Economics is not very good at speaking this word

757
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,600
But one of the almost central problems of political science is that

758
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
where is your strategy

759
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,600
You should now be able to find some links

760
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,300
That is to say, why was there statistics in the first place?

761
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,800
Because national defense requires war

762
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
how do you win the war

763
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
In addition to your data to be correct

764
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
You also need to know what the other party is going to do

765
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,400
that's called strategy

766
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,600
so early on

767
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
these things just go together

768
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,600
good

769
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
let's see the next one

770
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,000
So when it comes to this so-called game theory

771
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
i want to mention him a little bit

772
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,400
when we just ate

773
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,400
Still talking to the vice president about this person

774
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,600
Called Thibis Nash

775
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,100
On the left is when he was younger

776
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,700
On the right is when he won the award

777
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,800
But during this time

778
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,100
The vice president should be invited to introduce him

779
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,100
Ask Nash to meet them

780
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
should have met

781
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,800
his story is very very wonderful

782
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,300
If you are interested

783
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,600
you can go to him

784
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
It should be someone else helped him write the album

785
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,100
It's called A Beautiful Mind

786
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,200
beautiful mind

787
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,600
very well written

788
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,700
what kind of man would nash be

789
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,200
who we are reading the innings of now

790
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,100
There's probably no way you don't know Nash's name.

791
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,700
Why

792
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,300
Because your equilibrium is called Nash

793
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,200
if you take Nash off

794
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,300
you don't know what you're doing

795
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,200
So now we are looking for something every day

796
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,400
Called Nash Junker

797
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
Nash means Nash

798
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,900
Then I remember when I was learning the game

799
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
i asked my boss

800
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,000
When did Jiang Nash die?

801
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
He said there is no death

802
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,900
why didn't he write paper

803
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,500
Shouldn't he write a lot of papers?

804
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,100
Then you go to see his doctoral dissertation

805
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,300
He originally wrote his doctoral dissertation

806
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,800
Hearing and writing three pages

807
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,900
Later he was too embarrassed to tell him

808
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,400
don't just write three pages

809
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,000
Later he wrote him in twenty-one pages

810
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,100
You can still download now

811
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,000
maybe hit his name

812
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,700
It should be possible to connect to download his doctoral thesis

813
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,500
That doctoral dissertation is very well written

814
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,800
his most important contribution

815
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,640
The so-called Naschic Lubeum

816
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,940
Naschic Lincoln

817
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,900
from his doctoral dissertation

818
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,640
OK, that's John Nash.

819
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,000
himself his story is full of drama

820
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,400
when he was already very famous

821
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,300
After about 30 years old

822
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,440
He has Skytophrenia

823
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,780
just have schizophrenia

824
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,040
OK, of course I heard that Princeden is very nice to him.

825
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,580
So he was in Princeden for a long time

826
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,420
In 1994, he was to be awarded the Norbert Prize in Economics

827
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,220
see how long it takes

828
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,720
so he is a very important person

829
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,880
So why is John Nash so important?

830
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,280
he has a little story

831
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,780
That is to say, the person he most admires

832
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,380
It's the first photo

833
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,880
Fornoiman

834
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,280
Why

835
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,520
because Fornoyman was in Princeden at the time

836
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,820
Institute for Advanced Study

837
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,580
So he always wanted to

838
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,320
The great John Fornoyman had an impression of him

839
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,520
because he's just a young guy

840
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
go to doctoral class

841
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,920
he knows why

842
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Why did he choose Prince instead of Harvard?

843
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
'Cause Prince's got these freaks over there

844
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Einstein that Fernoyman

845
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's these freaks from Europe

846
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
i just forgot to say

847
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That is to say, Jiang Fernoyman

848
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
He is a Hungarian Jew

849
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
he is complicated

850
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
not very complicated

851
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Said his family affairs are complicated

852
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
what game did he play when he was a kid

853
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
his daddy would put his daddy as a banker

854
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
just call him

855
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Come now you make a game for

856
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
my guest see

857
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Come on, here is a phone book, right?

858
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
then you start watching now

859
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Watch it, cover it up

860
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Come on, you recite their phone numbers

861
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I think it's best not to let my kids play this kind of game

862
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
scary

863
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
he is a genius

864
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Then for Jiang Nash to let

865
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that's what they call

866
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It just came to my mind

867
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That is to say, in order to impress Jiang Fernoyman

868
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
He went to discuss math problems with him

869
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
but heard

870
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I heard that Jiang Fernoyman could not bear to dump him

871
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
He was greatly stimulated

872
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,400
I did the game before and I did the game

873
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,000
So he later wrote his national books

874
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,600
that this is a short story

875
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,000
But I know that between these mathematicians

876
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
they have some really weird connections

877
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But then of course because he wrote

878
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The so-called National Collibion

879
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
become famous

880
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
OK so famous we don't even know where he is

881
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
but he is very important

882
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But certainly no John Nash without Fanolimne

883
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
They are actually linked

884
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Well this is John Nash

885
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Then let's talk a little bit about the last topic.

886
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The so-called political science in the institute

887
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Now back to the core question of political science

888
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The core problem is probably Power

889
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Power

890
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
But how many words are there that are very similar to Power?

891
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Do you want to talk about it here?

892
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Closer to Power

893
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
related to power

894
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Authority

895
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
authority power

896
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
that is not that force this force

897
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
is the power of that power it does not

898
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,600
ok then let me tell you

899
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,800
Authority it is a very interesting state

900
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,000
its essence is violence

901
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,200
what is violence

902
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200
It's just that I can make you not want to do this thing

903
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,600
I must let you do this

904
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,800
if you don't want to

905
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I can restrict your freedom

906
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,400
To put it bluntly, I can lock you up

907
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,600
that's what it means

908
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,400
OK, of course I can use many other methods

909
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,200
to restrict you from doing something

910
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
So it's essentially a violence

911
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,600
So its violence means

912
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
I know you really don't want to do such a thing

913
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
But I force you to do such a thing

914
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Okay, so why can Authority be compared with violence?

915
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Because there is a process in it

916
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,800
OK it's a power

917
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,200
what is power

918
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,600
power and the force that general economists talk about

919
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
a little different

920
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,800
power means

921
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,000
if i say now to you

922
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
If I don't have power for you

923
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm not sure if you'll listen to me

924
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
so it has a mandatory meaning

925
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
power means mandatory

926
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
so its core

927
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Because it is essentially relying on violence

928
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
so it will have power

929
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
But what's interesting about it is that it says

930
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
it will tell you

931
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
people who use power will tell you

932
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I use this power because

933
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I have a legal process

934
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
so it is

935
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Planning to be publicly desirable

936
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Which means I did it to you because

937
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I have to look out for the interests of the majority

938
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
example

939
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
or if I don't

940
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
i may be other

941
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like things like destroyed by power

942
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
so this is a very interesting feeling

943
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
what is authority

944
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
authority it must imply power

945
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The base of power is violence

946
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
so you need to know

947
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
These concepts are related

948
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
then let's see

949
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
the front side

950
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
good

951
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
let's think again

952
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That is to say, under what circumstances

953
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
what kind of situation

954
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
We don't need Authority

955
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
this is an interesting question

956
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We just said Power is important

957
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
We can't imagine saying a government has no rights

958
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
but you think backwards

959
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
what kind of situation

960
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We don't need Power

961
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You ask an economist and he'll tell you

962
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
why would he tell you

963
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Because he said at least when I was young

964
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
When I was a freshman

965
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Learn that individual economics, he told you

966
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
the market is perfect

967
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
invisible hand

968
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
invisible hand

969
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
This sentence is really good

970
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I can’t even see my hands, how can there be Power

971
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
know what i mean

972
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
economist at least

973
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I studied economics at that time

974
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
he told me

975
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
The Greatest Economist

976
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
just an invisible hand

977
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
telling us what to do

978
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
OK, what is the invisible hand?

979
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You have no idea where Power is

980
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
Of course there are some market rules

981
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,660
Under a certain market rule, you really can’t see it

982
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,680
There are market forces

983
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,760
But there are still many places in our human life

984
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,540
not only hands can see

985
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,560
and he wants you to see

986
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,600
OK

987
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,380
If you see you ignore me

988
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,920
I will use the next step

989
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,200
know what i mean

990
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,020
So the human phenomenon is very complicated

991
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,580
But economists are less likely to talk about this

992
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,880
because they want

993
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,180
The final order of the market is when it is invisible

994
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,480
dominating everything

995
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,000
OK

996
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,860
So if you use game theory to solve these problems in economics

997
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,400
you will have a problem

998
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,680
So what

999
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,780
I figured it out for a long time, if the final result is what will happen naturally

1000
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,560
Why do I use the game to solve it?

1001
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,840
know what i mean

1002
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,680
You can of course predict an equilibrium

1003
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,480
Then this equilibrium is that everyone

1004
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,020
he only for himself

1005
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,300
pursue the best interests

1006
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,340
society as a whole will achieve the greatest benefit

1007
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,360
Right

1008
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,900
It seems that many economists still think this way

1009
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,280
But for the time being, economists believe

1010
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,640
I also admit that there is such a world

1011
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
But it's not all of the world

1012
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,960
if your game is really interesting

1013
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,480
you should imagine a situation

1014
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,760
is when I'm looking for my best interest

1015
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,160
I will cause inconvenience to others

1016
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Only in this way will there be power

1017
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
That's why this power says you can't do this

1018
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
right? that's what it means

1019
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
If this matter is beneficial to everyone

1020
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,360
but it's not what you want

1021
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,360
then i can ask you to do this

1022
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,520
That is to say we are gamers

1023
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,080
will realize a very fundamental problem

1024
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,680
our individual rationality

1025
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
collective irrationality

1026
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,120
know what i mean

1027
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,640
That is to say, of course we personally can pursue

1028
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,680
your own interests

1029
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,720
But you have to see what the result is

1030
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
Could be a disaster for the collective

1031
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,960
Of course I'm not talking about all social actions

1032
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,520
or society's choice must be

1033
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,040
But we cannot rule out the possibility

1034
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,160
is ubiquitous

1035
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,280
wait a minute we'll see

1036
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,360
Where does this possibility exist?

1037
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
ok now let's see

1038
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,800
These three things we now fill it up

1039
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,800
The first of course is to say

1040
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,400
From the origin of history

1041
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,600
We will now give you a brief summary

1042
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
That is, the reason why statistics

1043
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,400
because some people

1044
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,800
He is in the process of building the modern nation

1045
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,400
Need to know where his population is

1046
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,800
this is not a simple question

1047
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,100
We now think that this problem is too simple

1048
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,600
Let's do a national census

1049
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,900
Just think about how it was possible 400 years ago

1050
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,500
it's very very difficult

1051
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
So who can figure it out first

1052
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,800
A better way to estimate

1053
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,800
OK, how many people do I rule?

1054
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,700
then i can count

1055
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,300
How many adults can serve in the military?

1056
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
When I calculate more accurately

1057
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,200
If the opponent is not sure, I may win him.

1058
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,900
So just started his origin

1059
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,300
Indeed, because some people

1060
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,200
In the process of forming modernity

1061
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,100
he needs to get to know people

1062
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,500
OK that's the fundamental reason

1063
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500
I'm going to find out who I rule over

1064
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,000
second what do i do

1065
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
usually for war

1066
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
usually for war

1067
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Don't forget it's the book

1068
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
the one just mentioned

1069
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The book The Nature and Political Observations

1070
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
it 1663

1071
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
what is the significance of 1663

1072
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
1663 you are going to push forward

1073
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
In 1648, a very important concept came out

1074
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
modern state

1075
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Do you understand?

1076
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Modern State

1077
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
We now use the watershed of the modern state

1078
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Probably Vesuvalia 1648

1079
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
How to say in Chinese

1080
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
kyphalia

1081
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
kyphalia

1082
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
that's it

1083
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
kyphalia

1084
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Cifalia system

1085
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
is what we see now

1086
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Actually Europe

1087
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The embryonic form of that time

1088
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
probably

1089
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It is Vesuvalia

1090
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
that meeting

1091
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
it's set out to say

1092
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
we are doing international politics now

1093
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
do international relations

1094
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
you need to know

1095
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
We still follow this system

1096
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
As far as Modern State

1097
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So it's probably around the same time

1098
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
so it's realistic

1099
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
That is to say, when the modern state is already in the process of forming

1100
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
At this time, there will be conflicts between countries

1101
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Then your conflict could lead to war

1102
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Then you start a war who will win

1103
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
because he is modern

1104
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
So he must have used the so-called scientific method

1105
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
If I can use the minimum cost

1106
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Estimate how many people I can rule

1107
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
how much food can i smoke

1108
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
OK how many adult males can I send to the battlefield

1109
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Then he won't report to the police

1110
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
he's more likely to win

1111
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Of course I know that human beings have always had this need

1112
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But when Europe has become a system of modern states

1113
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
We need to know that at this time he has a very intense competitive pressure

1114
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
The strange thing is

1115
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Of course science has a chance

1116
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Because modernity inherently has a characteristic

1117
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
called scientific

1118
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
This is the system

1119
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So from the perspective of historical development

1120
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
We know that the statistics come out

1121
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
related to acts of war

1122
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So he must have something to do with politics

1123
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
ok then let's talk

1124
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
From the essence of these three theories

1125
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Does it have some correlation

1126
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Then I think today this

1127
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
this is what i really want to talk about

1128
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Tongji

1129
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Games and Politics

1130
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
what is its relevance

1131
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
OK

1132
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think you can start thinking about this now

1133
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Why do we three things tie it together

1134
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
no way to take it apart

1135
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
so we can now

1136
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Take these three things a little

1137
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
rephrase

1138
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
we will say

1139
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
because there are three dots

1140
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
right

1141
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
statistics game politics

1142
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Then we just said

1143
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
If you go through game theory

1144
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
when your forecast is invisible

1145
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
then why do we need games

1146
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
know what i mean

1147
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
game theory

1148
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Began to become influential to economists

1149
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
It's because people don't believe that time

1150
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
out of sight

1151
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Right

1152
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This should come naturally

1153
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,740
He told you that I let you see every day

1154
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,460
so the country becomes important

1155
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,040
So game theory he actually told us that

1156
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,540
There are some things that constantly need someone to do it

1157
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,040
Can't really believe in the invisible

1158
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
so we now know

1159
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,340
That is to say, politics has something to do with the game.

1160
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,740
let me ask you another question

1161
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,540
What is political science? Have you ever thought about it?

1162
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,840
I forgot to ask you this question

1163
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,540
yeah so i'm going to ask you now

1164
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,460
I'm kidding everyone

1165
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,460
I remember my freshman year

1166
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,660
When I was a sophomore, I took a class

1167
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,960
The teacher will ask you a question

1168
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,160
What do you think is the difference between politics and economics?

1169
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,660
You should know economics

1170
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,160
what is economics

1171
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,660
is there another point

1172
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,660
what is economics

1173
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,660
Which one do you think is more important

1174
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
The way resources were just allocated

1175
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
any left

1176
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
all good

1177
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Do you have any other comments?

1178
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Ok, Ok

1179
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, this definition is very good

1180
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Let's come back to this definition later

1181
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
just over there

1182
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
good

1183
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Then the answer I heard at that time

1184
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
scare me

1185
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
what is economics

1186
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
economics first

1187
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Economics is easier to understand

1188
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
economics is in

1189
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
With limited resources

1190
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
For your resources

1191
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
for the best reason, right?

1192
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
because it must have a condition

1193
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
i.e. your resources

1194
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
not infinite expansion

1195
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Just under this given condition

1196
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The reason you do the best with resources

1197
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
right?

1198
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
probably acceptable

1199
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Then the politics are exactly the same

1200
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
really

1201
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,400
True learning is to make the best use of limited resources

1202
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,200
Aren't these two disciplines the same?

1203
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,400
Zhenxue plus two words

1204
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,900
Make the best use of the limited resources of others

1205
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,800
This is the fundamental difference between the two disciplines

1206
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,200
Why does the government tax

1207
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,600
Didn't we start off by saying it's taxpayer money?

1208
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,700
yes

1209
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,500
so he needs to rationalize

1210
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,900
He said that if there is no tax collection, there will be problems in society.

1211
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,400
so you just have to pay him taxes

1212
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
do you really not pay taxes

1213
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,800
waiting behind waiting for you

1214
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,200
So political phenomena must be compulsive

1215
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,300
So why would he follow some political science

1216
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,500
such as ethics

1217
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
would even say that a large part of political philosophy is discussing this issue

1218
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,900
How the state can justify its coercion against you

1219
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,800
ok, this is a very big difference between political science and economics

1220
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,900
But in essence, it is the best use of resources

1221
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,000
just one is its own resource

1222
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,200
one is someone else's resource

1223
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,700
just kidding

1224
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,200
alright

1225
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,600
we now return to political science

1226
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,840
Political science, in fact, we just talked about it like this

1227
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,340
game theory

1228
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,840
if it's going to be useful

1229
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,940
In fact, it should be more useful for political science

1230
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:10,340
Why

1231
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,240
Because its core concept is strategy

1232
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,600
what is strategy

1233
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,400
strategy means that it is at your hand

1234
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,800
For example, in the case of three sides

1235
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,300
which one do you think is more important

1236
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,600
Right

1237
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,340
Then you said that the public funds should be included in the basic public funds

1238
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,740
It's better to raise it to 30,000 yuan

1239
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,440
or to solve other problems first

1240
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,300
something like this

1241
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,260
That is to say, you have to choose a strategy

1242
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,660
And each strategy choice

1243
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,740
may have to be considered

1244
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,140
Will the other party

1245
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,360
For example, the basic salary is increased to 30,000 yuan.

1246
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,500
Will there be some adverse effects

1247
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,400
issues such as

1248
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,060
OK

1249
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,300
this is a link

1250
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,260
then ask

1251
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,740
What is the relationship between politics and statistics?

1252
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,360
yes

1253
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,060
Just one relatively capable

1254
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Of course he hopes that his current decision is based on an objective basis

1255
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
right base above

1256
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So one thing we need to know is that

1257
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
sorry

1258
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
When the concept of statistics began to be accepted by everyone

1259
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The first will apply statistics

1260
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
In fact, it is a government agency

1261
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
OK is a government agency

1262
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Because he feels his rule must be based on a proper understanding of the society I control

1263
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
let's talk backwards

1264
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
If there are some governments when he doesn't actually do that

1265
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
In fact, his life span will be shorter

1266
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,000

1267
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
because you're not building on the right foundation

1268
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
OK so he might be wrong

1269
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
OK so we know

1270
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Then there is another line that I want to talk about today.

1271
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So what is the relationship between game theory and statistics?

1272
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
right

1273
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
We have drawn two lines

1274
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
one more line

1275
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
What do you think is the relationship?

1276
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Let's look at it from the concept of paying money

1277
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
we would feel like saying

1278
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The so-called Game Theory, it predicts what you will do

1279
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Does statistics try to predict the condition of the mother with the least cost?

1280
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So what's the relationship between these two?

1281
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
would you like to talk more

1282
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'd love to hear your answer let me have a sip of water

1283
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The mayor was in the defense plane, did he ever execute

1284
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Game isn't it?

1285
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Mayor, you and Luo Fa were locked up during the entire operation

1286
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
so what do you do

1287
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Fu Yu Lun you agree

1288
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I ask Fu Yulun in front of you if you agree

1289
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
alright

1290
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Well, I think it's all right

1291
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I think someone who has an opinion

1292
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Actually, I think you've got the answer to your question.

1293
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
we are in this world

1294
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The most important thing about modernity is that I'm anxious

1295
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
so i must win

1296
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
do you understand what i mean

1297
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Previously people may not have this state

1298
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
but modern is

1299
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,640
it will tell you one thing

1300
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,260
This is a competitive society

1301
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,540
you want to survive

1302
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,040
you are about to win

1303
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,640
something you know to win

1304
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
OK, the worst I have ever seen is the students in Singapore

1305
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,940
He is worse than Taiwanese students

1306
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,140
Because they have been divided into classes since childhood

1307
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,240
For EM1, EM2, EM3

1308
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,840
that's not mysterious at all

1309
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,540
What are EM1, EM2, EM3

1310
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,200
E is for English

1311
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,740
M is for Mathematics

1312
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,200
So you get a grade from a young age

1313
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,140
but your ranking in all singapore

1314
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,380
know what i mean

1315
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
I don't know if that's the case now

1316
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,080
But they are very competitive

1317
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,380
His EM3 ​​person

1318
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,380
He already told you from primary school

1319
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,380
Said you are the person from EM3

1320
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,380
So his system is very

1321
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,080
It's actually pretty scary

1322
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,580
But he is based on statistics

1323
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,380
but tell you

1324
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,780
You are among the children in Singapore who are all grade 1

1325
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,340
where do you rank

1326
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,780
that pressure is very high

1327
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,380
I want to say that I will definitely be there

1328
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,480
will win you soon

1329
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,980
This to his immigrant in a sea of ​​people

1330
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,200
what i'm trying to say is

1331
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,800
There is a system that does it like this

1332
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,900
But even if you don't have such a system

1333
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,900
The characteristic of modern society is, of course, that

1334
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,500
except in a competitive environment

1335
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
in a very intense society

1336
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Everything is ranking

1337
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,000
And I'm just talking about one thing

1338
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,700
That is to say, the concept of time

1339
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,500
part of modernity

1340
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,800
People in the past were not so precise

1341
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,800
Tell me what time, minutes and seconds

1342
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,800
you see i've been looking behind

1343
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,500
what time is it

1344
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,300
because i have to do the next thing

1345
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,500
so when your time is being

1346
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,500
when cut into very precise units

1347
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
All your stuff will come from here

1348
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,000
measure your price

1349
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,300
not value but price

1350
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,300
So of course modernity has a characteristic

1351
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,300
which means you'll be in a competitive situation

1352
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,200
That's why I say that in fact statistics started

1353
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,300
It is in the process of modern state competition

1354
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,300
There are some people who want to use the lowest cost

1355
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,300
to get the best estimate

1356
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,700
aim is to win

1357
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,500
what is winning

1358
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,500
To win is to beat the opponent

1359
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,000
so i know say

1360
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,200
There is a link like this

1361
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,600
But what is the relationship between statistics and games?

1362
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,100
Has anyone thought about this

1363
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,800
I wish you didn't say that last sentence

1364
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,600
no i feel close

1365
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,200
very close

1366
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:22,800
never mind

1367
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,600
never mind

1368
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,500
never mind

1369
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,000
what is your major

1370
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,300
your business department

1371
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,300
I think it makes sense

1372
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,100
that is

1373
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,800
Anyway, for most people

1374
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,600
You can't understand the paper of the game or the paper of statistics

1375
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,500
ok

1376
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,600
joke

1377
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,700
In fact, what you said is probably substantive.

1378
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,700
But it has one fundamental difference

1379
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,800
That is to say, through game theory,

1380
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,400
The predictions you are making are decisive

1381
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,700
deterministic

1382
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,000
right

1383
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,800
it will tell you which strategy is best

1384
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,400
which strategy is best

1385
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,100
Right

1386
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,700
For example, I now have three

1387
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,200
Then after my estimation

1388
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,700
I think the first time might be best

1389
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,100
it tells you

1390
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
first time best

1391
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
that's it

1392
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
when you do statistics

1393
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
it won't tell you advice

1394
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
it will tell you

1395
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Each strategy has its different amount of variation

1396
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
So it has a fundamental difference

1397
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
one tells you what to do

1398
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and another one tells you

1399
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
How to Minimize Your Variation

1400
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
or minimize your residuals

1401
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
right

1402
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
what do we call

1403
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
A good statistical model

1404
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It can try to make your arrow term

1405
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
The sum of the squares of is the lowest

1406
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
This is called the method of least squares

1407
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
but it won't tell you

1408
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
what are you supposed to do

1409
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But the game it will tell you

1410
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
which one is the thing you should do

1411
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
then i think you got the point

1412
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
That is to say, these two things

1413
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's two sides of the same coin

1414
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
when i'm making a decision

1415
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I know when I should

1416
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But who can guarantee you

1417
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Said it must be the best strategy

1418
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So it must have error

1419
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So people who do game theory

1420
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
its one of the most troublesome things

1421
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That is to say, in fact you look through the mathematical model

1422
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
deduced results

1423
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
is mathematically true

1424
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
but actually don't know

1425
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But you said that in fact you really don't know?

1426
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
nor

1427
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It will tell you the difference in probability

1428
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It will say, for example, you choose the first strategy now

1429
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
that should be true

1430
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But is it really guaranteed?

1431
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You need classmates and scholars to help you

1432
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
know what i mean

1433
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
That is to say, it plays a different role

1434
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
one tells you what to do

1435
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
The other one tells you how high the risk of doing this is

1436
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
But I don't think you can take it apart

1437
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
so it becomes

1438
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
When we look at these two disciplines

1439
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Wait a minute I'm introducing the definition in the middle

1440
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
that something

1441
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
When we look at these two disciplines

1442
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
very funny

1443
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's just that their tendencies are different

1444
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
But the problems they face are actually very similar

1445
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
that is, when we are making a decision

1446
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
what decision is better

1447
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's a matter of game

1448
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Another one is to say

1449
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
when we are sampling

1450
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
which sampling method

1451
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Which statistical model

1452
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
can minimize the level of our error items

1453
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
it equals the way because otherwise the government would offset it

1454
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,900
OK so it's actually facing the same kind of thing

1455
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,000
Then can we find a link between them?

1456
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,640
Let's take a look at the equation in the middle

1457
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,040
don't think it's scary

1458
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,880
It means that this is a Basein thing

1459
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,940
B-A-Y-E-S-I-M Basein Stuff

1460
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:21,200
it's called... let's just call it the back

1461
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,100
Its concept is like this

1462
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,100
That is to say, back statistics should be called back rules

1463
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,500
it has a belief

1464
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,500
It's Thomas Base who told us one thing

1465
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:37,100
Any of our decisions can be based on a Prior

1466
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,000
a bright faith above

1467
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,800
like i think you're good

1468
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,300
But are you really good? I want to observe you

1469
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,200
Then I can update based on my observation of you

1470
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,900
renew my beliefs

1471
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,500
That is to say, a person can have his own beliefs about anything

1472
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,300
doesn't matter

1473
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,900
But I can see through my constant observation of you

1474
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,600
and make my beliefs closer to the truth

1475
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,200
This is not the same as the concept of classical statistics

1476
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
OK means that I can make my prior belief through my observation

1477
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
slowly approaching the real situation

1478
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
So it must have conditional probability

1479
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Conditional probability means that

1480
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
For example, we see here

1481
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
That prdT means

1482
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Given T then the probability that D is true

1483
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
OK let me talk again

1484
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Just the one over here define

1485
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
This pr means

1486
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
prdT means

1487
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You have to look at the probability of T existence first

1488
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Then look at the probability that T exists

1489
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
part of D

1490
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
How high is the proportion of

1491
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
OK so you have to give a condition first

1492
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Then look at the condition where the condition exists

1493
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Below is the prior belief you are interested in

1494
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
what are the chances it's true

1495
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
and what is this on the right

1496
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's data when you don't have any theory

1497
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So we can define a thing

1498
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
That is to say, you can see the gap between the two

1499
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
One is that you don't have any theory

1500
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Another one is that you have a theory

1501
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Then you have to look at the difference between the two

1502
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Of course we know that the greater the gap between the two

1503
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I give a simple example

1504
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
For example, when I was a child, I really liked watching detective decimals.

1505
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Then I think the most interesting one is of course that Sherlock Holmes

1506
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I heard he's going to act recently, right?

1507
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
do you want

1508
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
to the UK

1509
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
then i think they

1510
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Really

1511
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
OK

1512
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
i heard there was this movie

1513
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So what I'm trying to say is that

1514
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I think the most interesting thing about him is telling us what reasoning is

1515
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Reasoning is actually a very interesting process

1516
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
He tells you that you can see the same things as normal people

1517
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
For example, the police can see this thing

1518
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Detectives can also see this thing

1519
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Then why are their conclusions different?

1520
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
That's the interesting question, isn't it?

1521
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
That is to say, the data you see is the same

1522
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
OK

1523
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
But what about this

1524
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
When a detective doesn't have any theories

1525
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
He wants to say that's all

1526
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But Holmes, he can take a closer look

1527
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Looking around, he said OK

1528
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
This is what a left-handed person does

1529
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
why can he do this

1530
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,600
this is an interesting question

1531
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,900
why it can be deduced

1532
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,400
Said the case was a left-handed

1533
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,100
Because you have to look carefully at the evidence at the scene

1534
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,300
because it can see something that others also see

1535
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,000
But others don't know why

1536
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,400
that is a very simple truth

1537
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
That is, if you see a pipe

1538
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,600
It is, for example, left over from the chest hand

1539
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,000
what do you want to see

1540
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,200
You want to see which side it burns

1541
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,100
know what i mean

1542
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,400
So you can immediately generate a chain of inferences

1543
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
If we are right-handed

1544
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,400
Which hand do I hold the pipe with?

1545
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
i don't smoke now

1546
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
So this example is not good

1547
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
So you have to know that in the 19th century

1548
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
everyone smokes pipes

1549
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
so you just have to watch which side it burns

1550
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,400
You can make a series of inferences saying

1551
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,400
This is a pipe it usually uses

1552
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,400
it must be left handed

1553
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,400
So this thing is

1554
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
you see the same thing

1555
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
But you because you have a theory

1556
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,400
say it might be left handed

1557
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,400
Then you see this phenomenon

1558
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,400
later you will carry people

1559
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,400
you will carry people's guesses

1560
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
OK, that so-called powerful detective

1561
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
He's looking for that tiny piece of evidence

1562
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Because he can find a lot of

1563
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Things that most people think are unimportant

1564
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Then he will slowly make his theory true

1565
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Say it's not just for lefties

1566
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
and he may be poor

1567
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
or something like this

1568
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
and he's funny

1569
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I couldn't understand when I was a child

1570
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Now fully understand what he's talking about

1571
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
He said that after you rule out the impossible possibility

1572
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
the rest is possible

1573
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
This is what Base tells you

1574
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
because when you see a D

1575
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
When a Data

1576
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
You have to know that he sometimes comes from T

1577
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Right? Your Theory

1578
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
But sometimes it comes from not T

1579
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
So you just find the

1580
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
The chances that he might spawn from something other than T are very low

1581
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then you believe he is from T

1582
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
small T

1583
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
OK that's a very simple reasoning logic

1584
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But I think it's very helpful

1585
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
That's why I will say next

1586
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
that T and D

1587
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Miss T and D

1588
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
It is probably a Theory and a Data we talked about

1589
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,600
Your physics department is very good

1590
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,760
what is experiment

1591
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,760
right

1592
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,800
It is on the computer as long as it is behind the work

1593
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,400
right

1594
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,600
then we can see its secret

1595
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,000
right

1596
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
just see all the information

1597
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:12,600
right

1598
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,000
So you can't put it on me

1599
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,200
So it can't be put into the experiment

1600
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,000
right

1601
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
There is a very important principle in your experiment

1602
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,800
That means you need treatment

1603
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,800
then you must know one thing

1604
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,200
You give it treatment and it will generate data

1605
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,000
You did not give it treatment it will not generate data

1606
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,800
So PRD is equal to you

1607
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,400
do you understand what i mean

1608
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,600
That is to say, the PRD behind this formula

1609
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,200
it won't generate

1610
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,400
because you didn't give it treatment

1611
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,200
so the previous one

1612
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,800
The conditional probability is the PRDT

1613
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,200
it is E

1614
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,800
because you give it treatment it will produce

1615
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,800
So you are comparing the gap between the two

1616
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,800
when it is equal to E

1617
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,600
you just believe it's true

1618
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,600
The big t is called truth

1619
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,600
It can also be called theory

1620
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,000
good

1621
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,400
So this probably means

1622
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,400
We're connecting games with statistics

1623
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,600
In fact, you can use the concept of a Base

1624
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,600
connect it

1625
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,600
on the one hand

1626
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
What the game tells you is

1627
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
sorry

1628
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
What we're doing is a prediction

1629
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
For example, an expectation

1630
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
It is better for you to adopt this strategy at this time

1631
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But there must be risks

1632
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
where does this risk come from

1633
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Depends on your previous game

1634
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Is your inference reasonable?

1635
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
OK so of course we want to say

1636
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
The prediction we make is

1637
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
There are some, say, theories

1638
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
tell you that you should do this

1639
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
do this for you

1640
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
risk is relatively low

1641
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
What is lower risk

1642
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
that is if you do

1643
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
no objection or anything like that

1644
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
So it's basically two sides of the same coin.

1645
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Then this is the so-called basic link

1646
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Then let's see who this person is

1647
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
who is base

1648
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You put the photo like this on purpose

1649
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
We want because our most important job today

1650
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's ancient, right?

1651
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
tell you a long time ago

1652
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
who is this

1653
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Is there anyone studying mathematics here?

1654
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I just asked sorry

1655
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Did you study math?

1656
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Then I deliberately put this photo

1657
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Who is that

1658
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Then let me tell you a very interesting thing

1659
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
This person can't take root in today's society

1660
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Because his preparation theorem has not been published

1661
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
his preparation theorem

1662
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
As far as the logic of the set of inferences we just talked about

1663
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
after he died

1664
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
After he died, his friends helped him gather

1665
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and then tell everyone

1666
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
In fact, apart from the fact that he is actually doing those things,

1667
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Then this is a very interesting theorem

1668
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So he can't root now

1669
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
The question is what did he do?

1670
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
What exactly are his other books?

1671
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
have you ever thought about this

1672
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Okay, let me reveal to you

1673
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Most of his writings are on theology

1674
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Many people find it strange

1675
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,500
because the pastor of the presbyterian church

1676
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,500
Pastor of the Presbyterian Church in England

1677
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,000
And he's probably older than Grant

1678
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,200
a little younger

1679
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:15,000
Probably an English Presbyterian priest in the early 18th century

1680
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,300
it's fun to let him talk

1681
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:18,100
Because why there are Presbyterian churches in the UK

1682
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,800
Because of course it has something to do with the Civil War in England.

1683
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,900
You can't finish the story of the English Civil War.

1684
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,100
let's not talk today

1685
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,100
i mean

1686
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,500
he is a pastor of a church

1687
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Presbyterian pastor

1688
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,800
so his real job is preaching

1689
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,000
Then why did he come up with the must be theorem?

1690
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,200
Have you ever thought about this

1691
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,100
And I heard you tell me a very interesting thing

1692
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,000
that is to say his name has been around for a long time

1693
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,500
people don't know

1694
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,800
Live to the last ten years

1695
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,900
If you are going to take a statistics class now

1696
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,100
You need to see if he is teaching back statistics

1697
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:53,500
Back-style back is his dead back

1698
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,100
Then we do the game a little earlier

1699
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,100
But after 1980, there was a game called back game

1700
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,300
What is a back game?

1701
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,000
mean to say

1702
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You can see your opponent's actions later

1703
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
you will renew your belief in who he is

1704
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It's natural, right?

1705
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
For example, I see you are weird

1706
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Just check what you say and watch what you do

1707
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
After seeing you for a while, I feel

1708
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You're supposed to be one of those things that I hate.

1709
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
He wants you to see the current information

1710
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Why is he in statistics

1711
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
In the last ten years, the fire has started again

1712
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
because it requires a lot of calculation

1713
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
require a lot of calculations

1714
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Only then can you update your beliefs

1715
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Then why does a vision think of this thing?

1716
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Because that reason is very simple

1717
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
you know what to say to him

1718
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
God is invisible, right?

1719
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
God is of course invisible

1720
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
But what?

1721
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
God will let you see

1722
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
things you can see

1723
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
this is interesting

1724
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
That is to say, you are an invisible body

1725
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
he will let you see

1726
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
things you can see

1727
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
so you as a believer

1728
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
You can see signs of God every day

1729
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So your Vision means this

1730
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you are always in this state

1731
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
you will renew your beliefs

1732
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
belief in faith

1733
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's just that he mathematicalized this thing

1734
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
so

1735
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Probably no one wanted to publish it at the time

1736
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
But he did write down his theories

1737
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
So be with him as a

1738
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Presbyterian pastors are closely related

1739
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
because you since you can't see

1740
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
then why should you trust him

1741
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
That's because he let you see some

1742
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
visible things

1743
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
OK good

1744
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
So this is Thomas Space

1745
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
That

1746
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
he is he must feel very strange

1747
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Why after 200 years

1748
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
suddenly began to thicken

1749
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
good

1750
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Finally, let's talk about a small problem

1751
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
that is

1752
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
how do we research

1753
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Research

1754
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Authority

1755
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
We say that the essence of Authority is

1756
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
How do I make the best use of other people's resources

1757
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
right

1758
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Then how to study him on this matter?

1759
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
This is of course the so-called political science

1760
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
There are many, many, many self-domains

1761
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
For example, of course some of us care

1762
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,200
process of legalization

1763
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,200
Some people care about legitimacy

1764
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,500
But we are also interested in saying

1765
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,000
Do it as a subject of empirical research

1766
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,300
What is empirical research?

1767
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,000
we need to understand

1768
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,700
For example, this country

1769
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,500
This government has a policy now

1770
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,700
Since the government is pushing this policy

1771
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,000
it must be compulsive

1772
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So we're going to ask the fundamental question

1773
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,300
does it do this well

1774
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,300
what is good and bad

1775
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:24,500
becomes something that can be measured

1776
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,500
OK so we definitely need to know a few things

1777
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,300
The first is to say

1778
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,300
what is the advantage of it doing so

1779
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,300
where is the disadvantage

1780
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,300
Can the benefits and disadvantages be measured?

1781
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,300
It would be fun if it couldn't be measured

1782
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,300
That's different

1783
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,300
OK

1784
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,300
Although I know that politics often differs

1785
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,300
But if it's on research

1786
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,300
It's all over

1787
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,300
turns into saying it doesn't have a consistent standard

1788
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,300
So there are some topics it can actually

1789
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,300
to understand

1790
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,300
What is the source of the so-called authority?

1791
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,300
How many people does it benefit

1792
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,300
OK of course we know no

1793
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
a policy

1794
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,500
It should be said that the policies that most governments are promoting

1795
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,560
more or less limited dissatisfaction

1796
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,360
Limited will be satisfied

1797
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,640
Then we have to measure

1798
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,840
How many satisfied people are there?

1799
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,100
How many people are dissatisfied

1800
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,440
So this probably means

1801
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,240
How do we study authority

1802
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,640
Let me tell you this example

1803
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,760
Then this is a very, very famous case

1804
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,600
very very simple

1805
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,160
let me say by the way

1806
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,440
That if you are interested

1807
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,340
Interested in Game Theory

1808
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:31,180
You can next year on May 15th

1809
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:33,300
Attend a lecture at the Department of Political Science, National Taiwan University

1810
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,380
That is Teacher Lin Zhemin

1811
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,440
The topic he opened is called president

1812
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,200
crime problem

1813
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,680
Mr. Lin Zhemin is in our building now

1814
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,280
He is a graduate of the Department of Electrical Engineering

1815
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,740
Then why did he study political science?

1816
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,580
He shouldn't think the electrical engineering department is boring

1817
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,740
He should feel that the problem of political science

1818
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,280
funnier than a motor

1819
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,740
Then why is he so obsessed with this matter?

1820
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,080
presence dilemma

1821
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,380
because he said it was a very simple model

1822
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,020
let's take a look

1823
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,460
We use this thing as a game theory case

1824
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,540
Let's look at this below

1825
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:06,960
this thing

1826
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,660
Let's say there are two people

1827
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,360
Two people

1828
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,360
Then each person has two strategies

1829
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,720
one called

1830
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,760
copyrightCooperate with each other

1831
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,360
The other one is called defect

1832
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,200
defact means not to cooperate with the other party

1833
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,960
So the strategy of the two people is the same

1834
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,860
and what are those numbers in the middle

1835
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,760
The numbers in the middle are your payoff

1836
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,760
The higher the number, the better

1837
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,800
so it's easy

1838
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,360
What we're going to look at now is to say

1839
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:31,320
These two people if he

1840
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,420
itself has two strategies

1841
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:34,960
Do you want to cooperate with each other?

1842
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:35,920
Do you want

1843
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:36,920
Do you want

1844
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,320
Then each state has four states, right?

1845
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
Two to one two equals four

1846
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,620
Each state will give you some points

1847
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:44,920
Then we now know that

1848
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:45,920
these two people

1849
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,160
Of course he just wants to get the highest score

1850
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,520
it's easy

1851
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,220
then what would you choose

1852
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,620
I should cover this first

1853
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,220
No, there are three here

1854
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:55,420
Can't hide

1855
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,420
Actually I should do an experiment

1856
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,980
Don't ask, let's see who you will choose

1857
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
So this story turned out to have been written a long time ago.

1858
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But who turned it into something that everyone can understand

1859
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
It's John Nash's teacher

1860
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Just John Nash in front of him, his teacher

1861
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Because he turned it into a story that everyone can understand

1862
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
What is this called? It's called a quarantine certificate

1863
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
OK now suppose there are two suspects

1864
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,000
they robbed the bank

1865
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
After being arrested, the police said whether they did

1866
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
So cooperation means I say I didn't do it

1867
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
To betray the other party is to say that he has done it

1868
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
The policeman is quarantine

1869
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So he can ask the same question to two people

1870
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
OK so what do you think your strategy is

1871
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Do you want to betray each other?

1872
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
you think you're gonna betray

1873
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I'm asking if anyone is nice

1874
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Then you don't want to betray the other party's

1875
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,000
just talk

1876
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Otherwise I can't go on

1877
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
You will have someone who doesn't want to betray the other party and choose the cooperate

1878
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
How about, okay, hypothesize like this

1879
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Let's say you don't sell out

1880
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
make you feel where your risk is

1881
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You'd think you'd be betrayed by him, wouldn't you?

1882
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Do you understand where my problem is?

1883
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That means you're going to wonder if he's going to betray me

1884
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
if i don't betray him

1885
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
The premise is that he must not betray me

1886
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But do you really believe he won't betray you?

1887
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
no why

1888
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
this is human nature

1889
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
but i want to tell you

1890
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
The basis of this human nature is the calculation of the game

1891
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
let me tell you something

1892
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
think about it

1893
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
You now have two strategies

1894
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Let's assume you are cooperating with defender

1895
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Let's assume that the other party will cooperate with you

1896
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Then do you want to betray him?

1897
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Four points for betraying him, right?

1898
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Then what

1899
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
if the other party betrays you

1900
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
more to betray him

1901
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,400
So why did I just say that there is one of the most interesting aspects of the game?

1902
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,200
you have to be able to imagine what you want to do

1903
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,480
to imagine what he would do

1904
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,780
so feel weird

1905
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,800
i will betray him

1906
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,820
he will betray me

1907
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,600
right

1908
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,120
so what is the end result

1909
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,680
so how many points will you end up with

1910
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,740
Is the result of 22 good?

1911
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:21,240
not good

1912
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,060
This is a very interesting example

1913
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,140
I'm going to use this as an example for someone who hasn't learned the game at all

1914
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,920
That said, the funniest part of the game is here

1915
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,040
22 He is the only one among the four results that does not belong to paradise optimal

1916
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:35,840
What is paradise optimal

1917
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:37,880
how to define

1918
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,920
if a result can't be better

1919
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,720
The result is paradise optimal

1920
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,040
Then we now find that there are four results on the side of these four results

1921
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:49,400
The only result that is not paradise optimal is mutual betrayal

1922
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,960
But he is the only balance

1923
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1924
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,800
That is to say if

1925
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,100
If you cooperate with each other, you can get three points.

1926
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,880
But why do you betray each other by two points?

1927
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,460
so i'm thinking like this

1928
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,260
If you have time, watch the first episode of Wu Jiandao

1929
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:10,460
that was a difficult choice

1930
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,460
I just send a signal to the other party

1931
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:13,460
will he believe it

1932
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,460
Even if he believes, will he be sentenced to me?

1933
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,260
Because Wu Jian said that he actually talked about a

1934
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:20,760
It's human

1935
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:23,260
But it's also one of the most troubling issues of game theory.

1936
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,260
How can I keep the other party from going out?

1937
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,760
Very difficult

1938
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,260
Very difficult

1939
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,720
Then this often happens

1940
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,720
often appear in our life

1941
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,720
That is, if we both choose to trust each other

1942
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,720
Maybe I will be betrayed by the other party

1943
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,220
So when I think about it I think it's still a bit new

1944
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,220
I just sold him

1945
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,220
And at this time the police actually knew

1946
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,720
even if you call

1947
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,220
The other party will still sell you

1948
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,220
This has nothing to do with Information

1949
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,720
Let's say I got a call from you saying

1950
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,720
i will cooperate with you

1951
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,720
I'll send you a press number to say

1952
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,720
i will cooperate with you

1953
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:55,720
let you see him betray him

1954
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,720
Then there must be a conspiracy

1955
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,680
remember me

1956
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,600
Of course we say from a statistical point of view

1957
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,800
really do experiments

1958
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,400
Of course we know that it means that most of the opponent's battles will be betrayed.

1959
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,800
But there are still a few

1960
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,000
Few people he didn't choose to betray each other

1961
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,900
Then this minority is worth studying.

1962
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,200
why didn't you betray the other side

1963
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,800
Of course one of the simplest answers is in the laboratory

1964
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,200
know what i mean

1965
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,800
Do an experiment, do an experiment in social science

1966
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,600
The biggest problem is that he has no external effects

1967
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,800
I'm in the lab and of course I can believe anything

1968
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,800
good

1969
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,800
sitting sitting sitting

1970
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,800
right

1971
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,800
good

1972
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,800
good

1973
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:45,800
Yeah

1974
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,800
somewhat related

1975
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,800
Then I think it will be more betrayal

1976
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,560
So it won't be like this two sessions

1977
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:33,680
this is the real game

1978
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,880
The game will take these factors you just won

1979
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,400
all as unknowns

1980
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,680
For example, I now assume

1981
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,000
For example, the judge and the defendant

1982
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,440
he is playing a game

1983
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,160
Then I would say that the judge's package matches the defendant's package

1984
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,720
He is, say, XYD or something

1985
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,400
Then I will say under what conditions

1986
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,240
The end result is that he'll plead guilty and negotiate.

1987
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,960
This game is actually not that difficult

1988
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,600
Why

1989
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,840
Because he must know the judge's attitude

1990
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
The two sides do not know each other's attitude

1991
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
That is, when a game is played

1992
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
it comes in various forms

1993
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
message is very important

1994
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
If I could somehow

1995
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
let you know my attitude is this

1996
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's actually too simple

1997
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
through a lawyer

1998
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
can already let him know

1999
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
you just plead guilty

2000
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
you can come out

2001
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Introspect, that's what it means

2002
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So this game is actually not that difficult

2003
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So I think

2004
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
want

2005
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
right

2006
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
right

2007
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
right

2008
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
right

2009
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
meeting

2010
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
meeting

2011
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
meeting

2012
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
right

2013
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
i totally agree with you

2014
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
that is

2015
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
In this case if you

2016
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
it shouldn't be what i want to talk about

2017
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I don't study law

2018
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
But I think from studying the law

2019
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,260
have a point of view on this matter

2020
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,260
it is legal

2021
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,360
OK the main problem is plea bargaining

2022
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:06,460
there is something wrong with the system

2023
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,460
Anyway

2024
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,260
simply speaking

2025
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,460
When the judge made this decision

2026
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,960
If he thinks it's legal

2027
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,760
Will he care what voters are thinking

2028
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,760
Nope

2029
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:17,660
know what i mean

2030
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,060
Because we usually judge

2031
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,960
It's all prosecutors who want to present

2032
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,260
I'm going to sue this guy

2033
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:25,760
Then your proof is

2034
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,860
prosecutors decision

2035
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,260
Judges can only rely on prosecutors

2036
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,960
Bring the evidence to trial

2037
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:31,760
so you want to do one thing

2038
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,560
let's not talk about this case

2039
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,560
we talk

2040
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,860
Black heart food is ready

2041
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,860
Why is black heart food innocent in the end?

2042
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:39,160
Of course, many people reacted directly and scolded the judge.

2043
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,160
but you need to know

2044
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,660
it's a sequential game

2045
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,660
As a result, the judge finally has to make a verdict

2046
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,860
You must only look at the evidence presented by the prosecutor.

2047
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:47,960
So many people feel

2048
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,160
prosecutors are responsible

2049
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:49,860
yes

2050
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,060
But the prosecutor

2051
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,300
what are you responsible for

2052
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,460
because it is based on what

2053
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,160
According to the real security law

2054
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,460
Who made the real security law?

2055
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,660
your elected status

2056
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,560
the people themselves

2057
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
What do you mean?

2058
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
that is

2059
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It's a pretty complicated political issue

2060
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Then why did the legislators make a real case that is difficult to implement?

2061
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
OK, then you will say that the legislator came from there before the election

2062
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
OK that's why I think

2063
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I can't talk about this anymore

2064
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That is to say, in fact, many times

2065
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
people have only themselves to blame

2066
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
For example, when you are in an election

2067
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
How on earth did you unify that vote?

2068
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
But I think that's changing

2069
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
i think it's changing

2070
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
At least many people will be dissatisfied with this verdict

2071
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
he should

2072
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
This Act of Act should be amended in the future

2073
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
because you know you have problems at the source

2074
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
There will be problems later on

2075
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
OK so all I can do is

2076
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You have to take a good look at your actual case law

2077
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
What are you listening in?

2078
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
the law of fact

2079
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
if there is a judge

2080
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
know that the court has a

2081
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
is to be judged

2082
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
yes

2083
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
right

2084
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Now this heaven about this political situation

2085
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I agree

2086
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
many people like this

2087
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,840
certainly

2088
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,960
you know the biggest problem right now is

2089
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,520
Your current law will make the final judgment difference

2090
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,320
this is the biggest problem

2091
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,900
Which means you're giving judges too much freedom to administer.

2092
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,180
this is the biggest problem

2093
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,000
He can also follow this exactly

2094
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,020
say he is guilty

2095
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,040
He can also say he is innocent

2096
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,080
because many details

2097
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,120
but i think this is

2098
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,920
yes

2099
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,760
yes

2100
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,340
So I think you still have to look at the content of the law at the source

2101
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:37,880
but i believe many people

2102
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,920
Most people haven't read the real security law

2103
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,480
You're interested to see what exactly they stipulate

2104
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,000
ok

2105
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,040
Then we have to finish our topic

2106
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,320
what to do

2107
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,860
Can everyone understand this?

2108
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:49,920
This is a very, very simple game

2109
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,960
It's very simple, just two people

2110
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,720
Two people

2111
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,000
Only two strategies per person

2112
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,800
I can't imagine an easier game

2113
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,840
Simultaneous action

2114
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,840
It turned out to be a tragedy indeed

2115
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
that's why

2116
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
4 is better than 3 3 is better than 2 2 is better than 1

2117
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
It is your cooperation points, how much benefit you get

2118
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Because I want people to understand right away

2119
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Because this may for example

2120
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
You can use the reverse operation how long you will be locked up

2121
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Then I just temporarily use the order of the size

2122
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
so that everyone can understand

2123
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
I'm just saying the rules of the game are simple

2124
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Everyone wants to get the highest score

2125
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
But the final result was the penultimate time

2126
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Right

2127
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
i sure wish i had better get out

2128
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But when everyone counts like this

2129
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
would create a big problem

2130
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
is when each of you counts like this

2131
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
The end result is really unwanted

2132
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
but there is no way

2133
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Then I would think that this is actually called

2134
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Later they became matchmakers

2135
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
There's a reason it's called the Prisoner's Dilemma

2136
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You say that when we engage in social action

2137
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
often in places where the prisoners are very ordinary

2138
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
What kind of relationship do I want to maintain with the other party?

2139
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Very difficult

2140
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Of course there are many people who are solving the criminal problem

2141
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
The first one is you let him keep playing

2142
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Will the second round be better?

2143
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Won't

2144
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
really won't

2145
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
round three will be worse

2146
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
OK

2147
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Because you have betrayed me before

2148
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
now don't i betray you

2149
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
One way is you let him keep playing

2150
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
But don't know he knows when it will lift

2151
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
it's an interesting inference

2152
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
because when you

2153
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I say this by the way

2154
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That is to say, when you are in this state

2155
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
you have to keep playing with him

2156
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
But when you're not sure when it's gonna end

2157
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
he's going to be a really interesting thing

2158
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
called culture

2159
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
culture comes from here

2160
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
what is culture

2161
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Culture is a norm that everyone abides by

2162
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And he's not legal

2163
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
That is to say when you talk to each other

2164
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
when you've been in this kind of trouble

2165
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
do you feel good

2166
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I believe you first

2167
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Do you want to believe me too

2168
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
When I found out that it was okay

2169
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Next round he will strengthen

2170
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,800
That is to say, you will find out whether to say betrayal or not to betray

2171
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,200
It enhances the result of the previous round

2172
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,300
So if some people happen to

2173
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,200
They didn't think that much

2174
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,500
He said I just believe you

2175
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,500
then you also believe me

2176
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,000
I feel it's ok

2177
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,200
so it becomes a

2178
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:18,000
often called culture

2179
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:18,700
very funny

2180
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,400
The starting point of that culture is actually the game

2181
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,600
Although we are talking about culture all day long

2182
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,100
But it's like not talking

2183
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,300
a thing we often talk about

2184
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,600
That is why it does such a bad thing

2185
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,500
because it's a criminal

2186
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,200
why is this what he is talking about now

2187
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,000
why is it a criminal

2188
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,700
because it does bad things

2189
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,800
ok

2190
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,100
So what I'm saying is

2191
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,500
The starting point of many problems is actually in this state

2192
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:42,400
yes

2193
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,000
what's the problem

2194
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,400
It is to be the lower body of the relationship between the various bodies

2195
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:46,700
yes

2196
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,600
that this is official

2197
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,600
Should be from formal relationship fairness to

2198
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,600
They ended up with both being locked up

2199
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,800
This is pushed from the individual to the collective

2200
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
We start from a formal relationship

2201
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,500
and then implement something

2202
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,900
this question is very good

2203
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Then I'll just tell you the following passage

2204
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,680
Because you have asked the following question

2205
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,000
I really don't have enough time

2206
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,280
I'll just jump

2207
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,000
do you know who wrote this book

2208
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,440
Leviathan

2209
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,480
yes

2210
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,000
his name is already on it

2211
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
is this person

2212
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
Thomas Hoss

2213
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,640
why did he write this book

2214
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,560
We certainly can't say he invented the barter puzzle.

2215
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,240
no

2216
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,920
But his Revision

2217
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,160
Theme of

2218
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,480
The main argument is very similar to

2219
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,480
Revision

2220
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,920
If I may, I can briefly summarize it like this

2221
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,440
Though I'm not thinking of testifying

2222
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,560
he has a very important concept

2223
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:40,080
That is to say, through this book

2224
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,480
You can see why sovereignty is necessary

2225
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,880
Sovereignty is otherwise necessary

2226
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,680
why what is sovereignty

2227
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,400
because

2228
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,680
Hobbes he would describe a state of nature

2229
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:51,880
what is the state of nature

2230
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,880
just two swaps

2231
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,240
right

2232
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,560
Then your two begging

2233
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:56,920
You can

2234
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,240
see the state of nature

2235
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,880
is what they will do

2236
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,300
He used a metaphor, which I think is very expressive.

2237
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,200
Which means they all have swords in their hands.

2238
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,200
sword in hand

2239
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,700
He'll kill you when he gets a chance

2240
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,500
So the final result is

2241
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,300
we just saw the previous one

2242
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,000
that neutral defect

2243
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,200
betray each other

2244
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,200
So they are in a state

2245
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:21,000
it's a very bad state

2246
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,200
as a result of you protecting yourself

2247
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,000
make you mistrust each other

2248
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
right

2249
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,400
So better results

2250
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,800
Let's take a look at the previous one

2251
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,000
better result

2252
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
It should be changed from two two to three three, right?

2253
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
who can do such a thing

2254
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
So Hobbes he established his theory

2255
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
That is to say, who can

2256
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Under the situation where everyone is against everyone

2257
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
This is the prisoner's problem

2258
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Under the situation where everyone is against everyone

2259
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
can cooperate with each other

2260
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
He said there is only one power

2261
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
called advice

2262
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
distance

2263
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
This is the concept of sovereignty

2264
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Then we from this point of view

2265
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,400
you can see this

2266
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,600
From this point of view, we can compare

2267
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,120
you only need to know hobbes

2268
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,440
why is he so annoying

2269
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,280
But why are you here today

2270
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,440
still studying him

2271
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,680
because he told us one thing

2272
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:08,960
politics is inevitable

2273
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,560
i just wanted to say

2274
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,880
i should hire an economist

2275
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,960
Study the Prisoner's Problem

2276
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,360
how will they feel

2277
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,120
that feeling might be

2278
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,080
that is a special case

2279
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,760
That's a special case

2280
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,680
Really

2281
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:24,560
because i just

2282
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,800
Such logic is completely consistent with

2283
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,520
the rational logic used by economists

2284
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:30,280
but then why did you say

2285
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,280
Rational logic is a special case

2286
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,400
So Hobbes already saw

2287
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:33,960
this problem

2288
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,120
He said that if there is no coercive person to come out

2289
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,320
you on the handle

2290
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,480
Swords in everyone's hands

2291
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,760
when everything ends

2292
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,920
you'll keep going

2293
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,840
That society is in a

2294
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,120
state of war

2295
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,320
So who can make

2296
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,440
Swords in everyone's hands

2297
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,000
wrap it up

2298
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,520
only one thing called country

2299
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,520
so now everyone knows

2300
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,520
what is the definition of country

2301
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,760
Here we are

2302
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,240
There are many definitions of country

2303
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,240
What do you think the definition of a country is?

2304
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Research is a thesis

2305
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,040
Yes, you said nothing wrong

2306
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,440
What is a country? What is Weber's definition?

2307
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,540
I just know the definition of country now

2308
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:21,540
Of course many kinds

2309
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,600
That Max Weber from Germany

2310
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,340
Complicated. It's hard to say what subject he is in.

2311
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,080
He said that the state is actually a partner of legal violence

2312
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,680
Right, there should be nothing wrong with that, right?

2313
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:34,880
He is a

2314
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:38,580
Let him use force after legalization

2315
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:41,880
Then come a system that restricts people's freedom

2316
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,880
called national state stop

2317
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:48,080
Then you know it's a very paradoxical definition

2318
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:51,980
On the one hand, he can concentrate everyone's weapons in his hands

2319
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:52,980
much like the army

2320
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,380
army or police

2321
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:57,620
i can't imagine the army without guns

2322
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,620
You can't imagine the police without guns

2323
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
must be essentially a violence to them

2324
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
But he is a legal violence

2325
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Then this thing can help us answer

2326
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Judgment problem its a solution

2327
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
As far as HOPPS it tells us that

2328
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
When everyone and everyone are in a state of mutual hostility

2329
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
And even if you want to cooperate with the other party

2330
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,000
when it ignores you

2331
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
only one way

2332
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
is you let a sovereign come out

2333
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Take all the knives in everyone's hands

2334
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Then say you don't fight now

2335
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
because i can kill you both

2336
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
So the state it is violent in nature

2337
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
But its violence is with the consent of the people

2338
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It's a hanging rail, isn't it?

2339
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I make you agree

2340
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I can take the sword from your hand

2341
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
no way

2342
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
We have to see the result

2343
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Then let me ask you one thing by the way

2344
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Do you know when the revision was written?

2345
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
when was distance soul written

2346
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
guess and guess

2347
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,740
16 then 17

2348
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:08,300
Okay, okay, he should have published several versions of the performance he published.

2349
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:12,360
1651 what happened in 1651

2350
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,740
A very important event happened in 1651

2351
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:18,840
1651 English Civil War ended

2352
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:24,860
That Britain itself had a civil war that lasted for decades.

2353
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:29,040
There were a lot of little battles, and later everyone called that period

2354
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,600
Cyber War

2355
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,000
So he was in a state where the war was over and he was writing this

2356
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,040
So he has very, very strong space-time

2357
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,880
He told you that we went through the Civil War in England

2358
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,880
We did see that the British people really wanted to kill each other

2359
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,480
And you can't say that the other party is malicious, no

2360
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:49,040
So your only recourse is to stop calling

2361
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,380
stop calling so

2362
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:54,880
And let's not forget what happened in 1651

2363
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,420
It is the three years since the concept of the so-called Modern State came out.

2364
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,500
I think these historical cases

2365
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,000
Actually it has its connection

2366
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,500
has its connectivity

2367
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,500
And don't forget

2368
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,500
what happened in 1649

2369
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:13,500
In 1649 England did a crazy thing

2370
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,000
They wrapped Chelster First around their heads

2371
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,500
know what i mean

2372
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,500
Are you not interested in British history?

2373
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,500
Don't know where the UK is?

2374
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,000
Should I have heard Chelster First?

2375
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
when he wrote that book

2376
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
The UK happens to be in Common Wales

2377
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
The one in Cromwell

2378
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Columbware

2379
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,500
UK's Chelster First has been headbanded

2380
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,500
Why is it tied up

2381
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:41,500
because everyone voted

2382
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,500
So when Chelster First is going to be tied up

2383
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,000
also gave a speech

2384
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
he said no way

2385
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,500
this is what everyone means

2386
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,500
It's interesting

2387
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,500
Because it's mostly parliament that's against the king

2388
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,000
OK mostly congress is against the king

2389
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,500
So everyone thinks it should be wrapped around the head

2390
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,000
From a symbolic point of view

2391
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
If he could put a king to death

2392
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Congress is very powerful

2393
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
So actually we

2394
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
When he returned to history

2395
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
we probably know one thing

2396
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
If we look at British history

2397
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
That is to say, Congress is very powerful.

2398
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
then he can decide the king

2399
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
to be beheaded

2400
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
then you say

2401
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Huh? What about Chelst II?

2402
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Where

2403
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Just his son

2404
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Yes, his son's name is Chelst II

2405
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
just said

2406
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Let that John Grant

2407
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
The one that can go to the British Academy

2408
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
where is he

2409
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
he said where was he

2410
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
so

2411
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
he must exist somewhere, right?

2412
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
yes he is in france

2413
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I think European royal families are very interesting

2414
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
they usually occur in a country

2415
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
In times of trouble he fled to France

2416
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
because they are relatives

2417
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
so he's in france

2418
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Then of course

2419
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Something very important happened in England

2420
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
It should be 1689

2421
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
That's called the Glorious Revolution

2422
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
What is the Glorious Revolution

2423
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
You see these things are connected

2424
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
that is

2425
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
when we feel a normal

2426
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,680
When the government should be legal to have the tools of violence

2427
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,000
The composition of your government itself is very important

2428
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,400
You want to make the government itself unable to use its violence

2429
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,920
Hence the concept of legalization

2430
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,080
So I think the core issue of political science is

2431
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,600
A government cannot be free from violence

2432
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,800
The second is do you want to use this violence

2433
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,400
OK these are two things but related

2434
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,760
So I think we're probably seeing

2435
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:29,200
He MustHops he's in this historical situation

2436
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,640
we still have a little time

2437
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:36,000
Then how do we study that authority

2438
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I'll just talk about it

2439
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,960
So I do a little bit of a simple summary

2440
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,400
That means game theory, he studies war.

2441
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,200
In fact, his essence is to study war

2442
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,520
Research Dominance

2443
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,320
Then statistics he is hoping

2444
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,720
What's up

2445
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,200
Statistics He hopes to learn the most things with the least cost

2446
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:59,960
Then political science is the study of conflicts between people

2447
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,200
So the core issues of these three things are very close

2448
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,800
But the method used is different

2449
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:06,000
That just means that after the establishment of the modern state

2450
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,800
Gradually the disciplines are separated

2451
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,600
i can't imagine saying

2452
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,300
will ground it at that time

2453
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,900
what kind of scientist is it

2454
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:15,700
Its real identity is the person in the sales department

2455
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,600
ok you say Thomas Hopes

2456
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,500
what is it

2457
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:19,400
it is everything

2458
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,500
nothing

2459
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,900
but that is in the modern country

2460
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,500
when not yet established

2461
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,300
So after the establishment of the modern state

2462
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,400
There are so-called disciplines

2463
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,200
That's why we are so poor today

2464
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,800
I'm still writing when I get home

2465
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,200
That means I must contribute

2466
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,400
Political Semester Opens

2467
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,200
Otherwise, it would not be regarded as

2468
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,400
One of the best virtuous people of this generation

2469
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,200
Kidding

2470
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,000
i mean

2471
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,400
this is our tragedy

2472
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,000
But what I'm going to say is

2473
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,300
this thing will make us

2474
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,400
really have to reflect on one thing

2475
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,600
Then we can now use

2476
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,600
what we just talked about

2477
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,800
Are you here to study political science?

2478
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,900
Can

2479
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:53,300
ok, since we talk about political science and

2480
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:55,000
game theory and statistics

2481
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,600
If there is such a close relationship

2482
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,200
let's see

2483
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,800
what kind of things it can do

2484
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,900
As an example

2485
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Let's take this example

2486
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Devexche's Law

2487
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Mohist Devexche the French scholar

2488
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
he has a very simple definition

2489
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
He said the electoral system affects the party system

2490
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Don't forget that he said this in the 1950s

2491
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
1950s

2492
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
We now feel that it is a very common sense thing

2493
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
but he said

2494
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
If there is a constituency, he will only elect a winner

2495
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Just like Taiwan's single constituency system

2496
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
A single constituency in the two-vote system

2497
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
When there is only one winner

2498
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
votes for each of your constituencies

2499
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
will focus on the top two candidates

2500
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
It's called the M plus E rule.

2501
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
M is District Magnitude

2502
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
what did he say

2503
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
If your current system is proportional representation

2504
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It depends on how many places you have in the British election.

2505
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Proportional representation is good for multiparty

2506
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Of course, there is another system that was used in France at that time.

2507
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Called two rounds of voting Round out

2508
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
he said two rounds of voting were fun

2509
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
The effect on the party system of two rounds of voting is

2510
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
it won't be bipartisan

2511
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
It won't be a true multiparty system either.

2512
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,200
He wants more than both parties

2513
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,000
Why

2514
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,200
have you ever thought about this

2515
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,200
why don't i ask you again

2516
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:08,700
ok

2517
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,400
you go back to his core proposition

2518
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,400
His core proposition is a game problem

2519
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:14,400
if we feel

2520
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,900
The core problem of an electoral system is

2521
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,700
How many people can be elected in a constituency

2522
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:19,400
right

2523
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:20,700
we'll actually talk now

2524
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:24,200
Taiwan's electoral system is very unfair to small parties

2525
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,200
because of your constituency

2526
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,600
There is not only one seat in the British election

2527
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,100
So M is equal to 1

2528
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,500
then you get a corollary

2529
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,900
When M is equal to 1

2530
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:34,100
Voters' votes will be concentrated in M ​​plus 1 is two

2531
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:34,900
above the political party

2532
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,200
Well, there's some interesting mathematical corollary here.

2533
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,400
This inference is actually part of the game

2534
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,500
why don't i give my vote to the third candidate

2535
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:44,400
he will not go up

2536
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,000
correct

2537
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,400
then you have to figure it out

2538
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,700
why won't he come

2539
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,200
ok

2540
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:49,500
So he said it himself

2541
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,800
When he taught this theory in the 1950s

2542
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:52,200
He said

2543
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,800
Of course he didn't learn the game himself.

2544
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,300
But he talked about two effects

2545
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,700
One is the mechanical effect

2546
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,200
Another psychological effect

2547
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,100
mechanical effect

2548
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Effect means different electoral systems

2549
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:05,300
it will have different thresholds

2550
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:07,000
M size is subject to change

2551
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,700
He said your last party number

2552
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:11,900
number of valid candidates in other regions

2553
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,300
will be related to M

2554
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,600
The second voter also looks at the so-called Mocanical Effect

2555
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:19,600
If voters say that the M in this constituency is too low

2556
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,900
He said I don't want to waste my vote

2557
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,300
Everyone now knows what it means to waste your vote

2558
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:24,400
as soon as we hear

2559
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,000
7x keep Y right?

2560
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
That's what I mean

2561
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,600
That's called strategic voting

2562
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,000
Everyone is very familiar with this

2563
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,500
On January 16, you will know what strategic voting is

2564
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,400
And I know our strategic vote now

2565
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,300
very very complicated

2566
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,300
I still haven't figured out how to vote myself

2567
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:40,600
anyway

2568
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,900
This thing affects everyone's life

2569
01:31:42,900 --> 01:31:45,400
But he talked about it in the 1950s

2570
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,700
Then what we're going to ask now is

2571
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:50,500
This is a very, very famous definition in political science

2572
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,600
Can he be studied?

2573
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:56,000
Of course, when he brought up such a thing in the 1950s

2574
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:57,700
you can't see any equation

2575
01:31:58,700 --> 01:31:59,600
he said it

2576
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,400
I will say one thing by the way

2577
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,380
that newton he wrote that

2578
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:06,740
GBRVC is the original time of physics

2579
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:08,000
He also didn't use Equation

2580
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,280
ok

2581
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:13,000
you should read that book

2582
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,580
That is, he just uses Hirao straight numbers like this

2583
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,880
But there are many, many, many people behind him

2584
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,380
testing his theory

2585
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:20,880
This is Divac shape

2586
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:23,280
OK this is him

2587
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,580
that's st paul's church

2588
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,580
It was a symbol of authority at the time

2589
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,580
I don't know why he took this photo

2590
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
That is, he is higher than that authority

2591
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
should have that meaning

2592
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
this is the expiration of the camera

2593
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
ok

2594
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
One of our most interesting questions is

2595
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Do you think the law of Divac shape is Low

2596
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Is it a Low?

2597
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Because we usually talk about the laws of science

2598
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
We usually use the word Low

2599
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
it is a law

2600
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But do you think its Low is Low?

2601
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
this is an interesting question

2602
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
then let me tell a little story

2603
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
That is to say, this Divac shape itself

2604
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
he did not study political science

2605
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,020
he never studied political science

2606
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:04,000
Then what do you say he studied?

2607
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
He studies law

2608
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
just call it lol

2609
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
just kidding

2610
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
do you know i'm kidding

2611
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
this is no joke

2612
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
it's true

2613
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
he has a

2614
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
The one he just mentioned

2615
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
How electoral systems affect party systems

2616
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
He said it's called LOL

2617
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Although he himself is a LOL

2618
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
well

2619
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
scholars

2620
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
but

2621
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
he made a very important contribution

2622
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
He after World War II

2623
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
He founded the Department of Politics in France

2624
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Formerly French Faculty of Politics

2625
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
In fact, it is part of LOL

2626
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
because he tells you how to rule

2627
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
In fact, some countries still

2628
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
that is

2629
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
In fact, political science is very close to law.

2630
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
As far as political science is actually the law department

2631
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
or law school

2632
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
a branch at the bottom

2633
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
But what we talk about political science now is not

2634
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So he created himself

2635
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
so-called political science in french

2636
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
then of course we later

2637
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
After he dropped such a thing and came out

2638
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Many people helped him correct

2639
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
This fix is ​​itself a Test

2640
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
The first one hides some so-called game models in it

2641
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
For example, why should I vote strategically?

2642
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
If the political party knows that voters will vote strategically

2643
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
how is it nominated right

2644
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
This is an interactive process

2645
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
if i knew you would piss me off

2646
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
do i still nominate

2647
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Or is my nomination bogus?

2648
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
do you know what i mean

2649
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I really want you to vote for someone else

2650
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
OK, especially the two-vote system for a single constituency

2651
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
very complicated

2652
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
I may propose a false one in one constituency

2653
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
but i need your vote

2654
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
vote for another party

2655
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
We are now filled with such calculations

2656
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
So funny

2657
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
We are counting and he is counting

2658
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Well, many people helped him calculate this later.

2659
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Let his theory begin to formalize

2660
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
start more like a game

2661
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
And then a statistician comes in too

2662
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
what to do

2663
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
To see if his theory is true or not

2664
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Yes, because his theory is very simple

2665
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Your electoral system affects your party system

2666
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Let's take a look at a data I saw

2667
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
this

2668
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,440
He means first pass the polls

2669
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,640
It's the British system

2670
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,160
British and American systems

2671
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:07,440
That is to say, the constituencies are the same across the country.

2672
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,240
first pass the polls

2673
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:11,160
Whoever gets the most votes is elected

2674
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,640
Elected with the highest number of votes

2675
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,720
Then the two round system of TIS below

2676
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:15,960
vote for two

2677
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,960
that france only recently voted

2678
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:18,640
two votes

2679
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:20,320
Right-wing voices on the ground

2680
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,800
The far right speaks loudly

2681
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,040
So it's Olon of the Socialist Party

2682
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:27,360
He's going to speak to his former political enemy Sacozi

2683
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,560
I still let you go

2684
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:31,280
Otherwise, it will be very troublesome if the extreme right is elected.

2685
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,920
Because he is in many areas with strong votes of the Socialist Party

2686
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,880
They're all extreme rightists

2687
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,600
Relatively speaking, the highest vote

2688
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,720
So he had to let the political party do the mobilization

2689
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,320
Sacozi please come out

2690
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:42,640
do you know

2691
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:43,840
This is the mobilization of a political party

2692
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,960
A 2 round system

2693
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,200
The last one is of course PR

2694
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,160
Proportional representation

2695
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,960
we see a very interesting thing now

2696
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:52,760
Here is our observation paper

2697
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,440
This is the result of a sampling

2698
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,040
then fate and obsession

2699
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,560
fate is different from infatuation

2700
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,160
The word of fate is all the papers add up

2701
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,120
out of your observation

2702
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,340
Midian is where you arrange

2703
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,540
like row from smallest to largest

2704
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:06,040
then take the middle one

2705
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,440
Then effectively shift

2706
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,840
Effective positive file number it is actually an proxy

2707
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,040
The algorithm for the number of effective positive gears is

2708
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,300
You take the square of the seat rate of each positive file

2709
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:17,040
Add it up and remove it with E

2710
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,040
a little complicated

2711
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,640
Just use E to divide a Sigma

2712
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,540
Then the right side of Sigma

2713
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:24,500
It is the percentage of votes received by each positive file

2714
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,340
Sorry, the square of the seat rate

2715
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:28,000
OK will get a number

2716
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,200
effective positive gear number

2717
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,800
Etecific number of parties

2718
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:31,500
that's fun

2719
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,700
We're looking at Midian

2720
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,400
Then I was shocked when I saw the result

2721
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,500
At least the training is right

2722
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,500
as it was in the 1950s

2723
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:39,700
writing this

2724
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:40,900
But from my later data

2725
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:42,500
This 2011 data

2726
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,700
How much Midian is two

2727
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,800
That is to say, what am I doing here?

2728
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,700
I know it has a theoretical expectation

2729
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:51,700
Theoretical expectations from games

2730
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,400
說first pass to the post

2731
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,200
it should form two gears

2732
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,800
I'm coming to check it out

2733
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,500
Then this test

2734
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,600
Of course, many countries are not in between

2735
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,100
some countries

2736
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,400
Some countries have few political parties

2737
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,360
some a lot

2738
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:03,960
But its mystery is two

2739
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,640
so we know

2740
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,160
DVX he did a thing

2741
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:08,840
He uses a very simple pattern

2742
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,360
tell us one thing

2743
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,840
Then this thing can be verified

2744
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,960
I will testify for him now

2745
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:15,360
I see it like this

2746
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,520
Let's look at PR again

2747
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,560
the bottom one

2748
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,800
Propulsion Rune Sensation 3.46

2749
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:22,040
What is the value

2750
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,600
some countries may have many

2751
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,440
Some countries have a high number of medical places

2752
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,080
relatively low

2753
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,400
But he will not be two long values

2754
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,720
very interesting

2755
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,600
TRS

2756
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,840
Why 2.24

2757
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,280
Everyone never thought about this kind of problem

2758
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,360
that's a simple reason

2759
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,480
The so-called Turon System means

2760
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:40,760
two rounds of voting

2761
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,320
two rounds of voting means

2762
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,240
let's see the first round

2763
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,640
Is there anyone more than half

2764
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,360
If there are more than half of the people, he will be elected

2765
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,320
but usually

2766
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,720
under this selection

2767
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,720
You're gonna hope there's no one in the first round

2768
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:51,360
Right

2769
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,160
so you just

2770
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,440
There will be a bunch of parties in the first round

2771
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,840
Then see who's in the top two in the first round

2772
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:57,920
do the second round

2773
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,920
what would you do if you were young

2774
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,820
If you are a small party, now if Taiwan changes to

2775
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:04,420
From single constituency to two-vote system

2776
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:05,540
For example, a two-round voting system

2777
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:06,660
what will you do

2778
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:08,180
Of course you will threaten the big party

2779
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,420
So let's look at one thing now

2780
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,520
first round of voting

2781
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,860
OK is comparing who is the top two

2782
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,460
into the second round, right?

2783
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:18,620
So his competition is two

2784
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:21,140
So his effective party count will be more than two

2785
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:21,860
That's it

2786
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:25,340
do you mean to me

2787
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:26,780
That is because of your two rounds of voting

2788
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:28,780
so that small parties have a chance

2789
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:30,780
Although he does not have majority support

2790
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:33,340
But he has a chance to advance to the second round

2791
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:34,980
so he can maintain a certain

2792
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:36,340
The existence of small parties

2793
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:38,980
But the small party will not be too many

2794
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,180
And two rounds of voting have one

2795
01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:41,420
very interesting effect

2796
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:45,580
He will make it necessary for political parties to cooperate

2797
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:45,900
Why

2798
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,700
because it's simple

2799
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:47,500
because you don't cooperate

2800
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,020
you will lose the second round

2801
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,820
So the French think they

2802
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:53,660
their nationality is strange

2803
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:54,340
not surprising

2804
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:56,260
because you use two rounds of voting

2805
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,180
french say

2806
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:59,260
Hate each other but I love him so much

2807
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:00,020
it's not surprising

2808
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,500
right

2809
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,300
I said that's how you vote

2810
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,100
i hate you now hate the key

2811
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,100
but two weeks later

2812
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:07,100
we both made it to the second round

2813
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:08,100
I have to cooperate with you

2814
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:08,600
That's it

2815
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,800
Well, the good thing is that no one stays here.

2816
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:11,400
really not

2817
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:12,900
ok

2818
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:14,700
That is to say, the electoral system

2819
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,100
will depend on your culture

2820
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,200
But which one affects which

2821
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:17,900
that is

2822
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,600
issues we can't discuss right now

2823
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,000
good

2824
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,600
So this is a very simple definition

2825
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,200
that is

2826
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,500
our 1950s

2827
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,200
someone throws this thing

2828
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,600
Then the mechanism behind

2829
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:27,900
yes

2830
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,100
Actually

2831
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:30,000
median voter

2832
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,900
extension of

2833
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:34,300
That is to say, we can derive a law of M plus E

2834
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,500
Then the key involved here

2835
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,000
Voters will vote strategically

2836
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,600
Political parties will also strategically nominate

2837
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,800
Then he had a very clear prediction

2838
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:44,200
He said that if it was a unitary electoral system

2839
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,600
will form a two-party system

2840
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,000
Sorry if it's the deputy director election

2841
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,400
In the case of proportional representation

2842
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,400
multi-party system

2843
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,200
Then what

2844
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,900
DIS will be one of the two

2845
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,100
It's about 2 o'clock

2846
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,000
what we see now is

2847
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,900
It is right

2848
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,000
So this is a good example

2849
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:00,000
I'll go back

2850
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,500
the problem i started with

2851
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,500
What the hell is political science doing?

2852
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:06,500
we probably know one thing now

2853
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:10,500
That is to say, political science is actually different from what everyone thinks now.

2854
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,000
It seems to have nothing to do with politics

2855
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,500
actually its source

2856
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:18,000
next time maybe you can tell your friends

2857
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
statistics from political science

2858
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
He said you were crazy

2859
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I tell you why it's called statistics

2860
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,000
what does that mean

2861
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,000
you don't know right

2862
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,000
To tell you statistics is to measure your country

2863
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I hope someone from the statistics office will come today

2864
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
yes

2865
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I don't know if you talked about the origin of the word

2866
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
But that is a very real problem

2867
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
The second question is to say

2868
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
does it have anything to do with the game

2869
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
of course

2870
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Because it's part of the nature of politics that I want to win

2871
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
do you know what i mean

2872
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
What do you hear most often now?

2873
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
who will win

2874
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Right

2875
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
then how do i know i will win

2876
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I see polls

2877
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Who will win is the question of the game

2878
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
polls are statistics

2879
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,600
Of course we know that the so-called polls

2880
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:06,600
The current polls show that most of them are electric houses

2881
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,100
not very accurate

2882
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:11,100
We certainly have some people who do very clear polls

2883
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,600
He can't see it in the media

2884
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,600
But I think basically Taiwan's polls

2885
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:15,800
has his credibility

2886
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,600
So here we know one thing

2887
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:21,400
It is said that political science is a very old science

2888
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:24,200
It is closely related to the establishment of the modern state

2889
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,300
So we know that like statistical games

2890
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:28,000
had a close relationship with it

2891
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:32,200
OK, let's make another simple conclusion.

2892
01:41:34,700 --> 01:41:35,800
Sorry

2893
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,100
then turn around

2894
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:40,600
What questions do you think of when you look at our education system in Taiwan?

2895
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,700
my first question is

2896
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,800
they will ask me this question

2897
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,500
politics is not science

2898
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:48,100
I also thought about this question for a long time

2899
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:49,900
In fact, it's useless for me to tell my mother.

2900
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:52,200
Because she still doesn't know what statistics are

2901
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,200
She still doesn't know which word statistics is

2902
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,100
But I think a lot of people have this idea

2903
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,900
then i think we can imagine

2904
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,900
If in the US or Europe

2905
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,180
Japan I don't know

2906
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:03,040
This problem should not be that serious

2907
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:05,240
for example

2908
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,440
I don't know how American high school students choose courses

2909
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,040
But they should not be grouped

2910
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,040
Then I don't know why Taiwan has to be grouped

2911
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,840
Then the last math is a group

2912
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,940
Mathematics is not good is another group

2913
01:42:14,940 --> 01:42:15,940
that's terrible

2914
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,980
In fact I know a lot of people who read

2915
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:20,440
The so-called leaving the mouth is very painful

2916
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:22,040
They obviously like reading literature

2917
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:24,140
So you say literature should not study mathematics?

2918
01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:24,840
wrong

2919
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,980
math is important

2920
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,580
math is great

2921
01:42:28,580 --> 01:42:30,020
don't know what i'm talking about

2922
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:31,820
that is

2923
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:33,720
We group students like this

2924
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,020
Actually it's not good

2925
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,820
because there are some problems

2926
01:42:38,420 --> 01:42:41,020
In fact, it is not a problem of the subject itself.

2927
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:42,720
It's a question of how the teacher teaches

2928
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,220
Look, I saw a lot of people nodding

2929
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:47,220
right? we all suffer from it.

2930
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,320
right

2931
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,820
speak louder, yes

2932
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:51,720
and then i thought that was

2933
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:55,320
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR OUR EXAMINATION SYSTEM

2934
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:57,120
Why does it make some people feel like saying

2935
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,560
I'm not good at math, so I might as well go to school

2936
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,060
wrong

2937
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
At least not in political science, and not in sociology either.

2938
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Why do you have to do mathematics when you read Lizhu? How can there be such a thing?

2939
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
I think it's a lot of distractions

2940
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Actually, I'm not very good at math.

2941
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
so there is no necessary relationship

2942
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I think it's because people's lives are inherently complicated.

2943
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Sometimes we need to use specific disciplines

2944
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
some specific technology this nothing

2945
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I think of course we now reflect on

2946
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Taiwan's education itself has some problems

2947
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I don't know if it's a little bit better now

2948
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
or more serious i don't know

2949
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
listen to your opinion

2950
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Then I will talk about this place first today

2951
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
because sorry for more than a little time

2952
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
There's still a little time and I hope you can ask questions

2953
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Teach the player Teach the player

2954
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Ask Professor Lin

2955
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
ask one about that

2956
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
host

2957
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
practice until you can

2958
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I would say

2959
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Excuse me

2960
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Ask you something about politics

2961
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
continue

2962
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:10,000
How accurate are the polls about our current elections in Taiwan?

2963
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I should recommend you the paper I wrote

2964
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,500
Comparing the Accuracy Obtained by Different Survey Methods

2965
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:16,500
very very accurate

2966
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,500
I will tell you a little story

2967
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:20,000
Last year's nine-in-one election

2968
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
We made a very simple game

2969
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,500
We asked three groups of people to do the polls before the election

2970
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:29,500
Then ask them to write down how many votes Ke Wenzhe will get

2971
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:31,500
Write it down and ask them to seal it

2972
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,000
then send me

2973
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,500
and then announced after election

2974
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:37,000
it's interesting

2975
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,500
it's an interesting experiment

2976
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:44,500
Then, of course, the predictions of the three people are all over 52%.

2977
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:45,500
is correct

2978
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:49,000
But there is a group where he conducts polls

2979
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,500
then i was taken aback

2980
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:54,000
I was at the time we had a sort of speech

2981
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,500
just three people here

2982
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:56,500
I am the host

2983
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,000
i don't know what the answer is

2984
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
I only see one person laughing

2985
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,000
should be very accurate

2986
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Once opened, almost the same

2987
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
how does he do

2988
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
The question we have to ask is how does he

2989
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
He was clearly before the election

2990
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
That means polls can no longer be released

2991
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Then he used his method

2992
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
He just used traditional polling methods

2993
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
He goes to political map

2994
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
he didn't spend a lot of money

2995
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
but his answer

2996
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
when it is opened

2997
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
clap your hands again

2998
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Because the representative said it was really accurate

2999
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
because of last year's election

3000
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
not a good election to predict

3001
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
We know Ke Wenzhe will probably win

3002
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
But I didn't expect him to win so much

3003
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
And he not only predicts the polls

3004
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
is almost killing two percentage points

3005
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
That is to say, it seems to be 57.9 and 57.7

3006
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
so close

3007
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Then he connects each constituency

3008
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Turnout was exactly as predicted

3009
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
almost the final answer

3010
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
how did he do it

3011
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Then he did something on the spot

3012
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
He said

3013
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Now everyone knows that polls can be pretty accurate

3014
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,000
will you do the poll with me

3015
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
nobody

3016
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I do not know why

3017
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It should be a good business

3018
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Because he needs a lot of people to help him poll

3019
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Finally, someone said

3020
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,260
I can come and try

3021
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:03,760
His teacher must be very good at earth science

3022
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,240
anyway

3023
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:07,100
Then the politics students don't know what you're doing

3024
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:08,460
In fact, polls can be very accurate

3025
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,860
Then that teacher is a teacher in the Department of Politics

3026
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:13,040
So I think the polls must have a way

3027
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:16,060
That is to say, how do you pump the pressure?

3028
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:18,900
Then how do you get your answer

3029
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,300
absolutely impossible to call

3030
01:46:20,300 --> 01:46:21,600
It shouldn't be that simple

3031
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,760
You call and ask him who you want to support

3032
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,740
not so simple

3033
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:26,800
Let him do the political map

3034
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,260
That is to say, you have to look at each constituency

3035
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,840
who did he vote for

3036
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:31,140
Then you have to weight

3037
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:32,540
then you just ask

3038
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:32,940
OK

3039
01:46:32,940 --> 01:46:34,300
The result is very clear

3040
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:37,140
And I know his predictions are right every time

3041
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,940
so I can report a thing to

3042
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,580
Polls can be accurate

3043
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:43,540
But it's not the polls you hear all the time

3044
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:44,840
Just use that as a reference

3045
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,740
he has a little fun

3046
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:48,400
But there are actually people polling

3047
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,840
he may not let you know

3048
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:51,140
Come

3049
01:46:51,140 --> 01:46:51,980
joke

3050
01:46:51,980 --> 01:46:52,540
Come

3051
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:53,080
Thanks

3052
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,300
Thank you, teacher

3053
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,740
i feel like i want

3054
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,940
Come

3055
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:57,840
of

3056
01:46:57,840 --> 01:46:59,940
fact area of ​​objective experience

3057
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,440
make decisions

3058
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,560
But the source of decision-making power

3059
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,760
Is it normal Italian in general?

3060
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,440
The Genetic Facts of the Common Italian in Tradition

3061
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,500
then this is us

3062
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,240
Where modern stereotypes find it unscientific

3063
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,640
Because the modern age has changed

3064
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,340
What do you think is science

3065
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:18,040
not saying what i feel

3066
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,080
But generally our current mainstream stereotypes

3067
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:21,760
It seems that science is more like

3068
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,760
Physics and Mathematics

3069
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,840
It is more empirically verifiable

3070
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:26,840
do you think physics is science

3071
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:28,160
It's all science

3072
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,700
What is the core concept of physics

3073
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,860
It's just some meaning of philosophy

3074
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:36,200
have you ever seen an atom

3075
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,460
no i'm kidding

3076
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:38,400
mean to say

3077
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,600
Actually, let's talk about modern politics

3078
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:40,960
there are many parts

3079
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,500
some part is to talk to voters

3080
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,800
for votes

3081
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,200
that's called a public servant

3082
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,400
That's a lot of bureaucrats

3083
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:48,400
the bureaucracy itself

3084
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,600
It is the industry of a modern country

3085
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:51,560
you will find that many people

3086
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,360
His position will not be because of whom

3087
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,260
change in power

3088
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:55,860
OK

3089
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,300
so i think you should watch

3090
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,740
which department of the government

3091
01:47:58,740 --> 01:47:59,940
Actually I feel modern

3092
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,760
part of the bureaucracy is very precise

3093
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:05,880
it knows what its subjects think

3094
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:09,040
Because now especially in the era of social media

3095
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:12,160
There are a lot of ways that they can learn what people are thinking

3096
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,720
It's just that the biggest problem with the bureaucracy is that

3097
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,680
they probably know it's the right thing to do

3098
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,000
dare not speak to him

3099
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,880
know what i mean

3100
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:22,280
This is a problem with the political system itself

3101
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:24,480
that is to say some politicians

3102
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,280
Let's just talk about it, Shi An Fa

3103
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:28,880
Are you sure that's the only version?

3104
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,480
No, but why did this version pass in the end?

3105
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,520
This is a matter of legislative politics

3106
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,800
There are many elements in politics

3107
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,720
There are some ingredients that they don't care about at all

3108
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,680
They just make it acceptable

3109
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:43,360
their argument is fine

3110
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,800
But there are still some of them

3111
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,320
Because a very important condition for your modern country to run is

3112
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:49,840
you must know

3113
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,040
Let's say we're going to talk

3114
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,520
Guest writer, he is going to the ruling platform, not the ruling

3115
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:54,720
he's going to manage

3116
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,320
To him it's domination

3117
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,760
He is going to manage Taipei City

3118
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,080
the purpose behind him

3119
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
very important

3120
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,500
I give a simple example

3121
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,000
For example, he set up a bus stand

3122
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Just to tell you what time it is

3123
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
that is definitely not an easy thing

3124
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,000
definitely not an easy thing

3125
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
For example, he said that there is a charge for parking now.

3126
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
It's definitely not an easy thing

3127
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,000
He's going to do a thorough investigation on that one.

3128
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:20,000
only possible

3129
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
That is to say, there is this characteristic

3130
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
But with some governments he may

3131
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I don't pay much attention to this

3132
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
But I think democracy is a

3133
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
The good thing is he can make that

3134
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Does not rely on modern technology

3135
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Then the reign of chaos will come down one day

3136
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
or his party

3137
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I want to ask a question is

3138
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
ask the teacher here

3139
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
i ask a question

3140
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
what you just said

3141
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
about statistic

3142
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Does this statistic include it?

3143
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,000
so-called information

3144
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
know how to draw

3145
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
including taking pictures

3146
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,200
including control over the number of merging

3147
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:07,200
I think this is also a statistic

3148
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:10,000
as a game

3149
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
He has to understand such a distribution

3150
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Then this theory can be considered as this

3151
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Are you within the scope of today's discussion?

3152
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Or even including Ling Nai to formulate this notoriety law

3153
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
He put all this plant except Sweden

3154
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
All controlled by his notoriety

3155
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Then this definitely has very accurate statistic information

3156
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
That is, two things never had the same name.

3157
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
When the third type appears, the

3158
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:46,000
So from the game you just talked about

3159
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Spread all the way to species dispersal to map

3160
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
ask the teacher something like this

3161
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Is there any discussion in political science? Thank you

3162
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
should say so

3163
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Our political science is no longer directly dealing with this issue

3164
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,200
But I think for a modern country

3165
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:03,600
very important thing

3166
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,800
Do you know one thing

3167
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,600
When Japan colonized Taiwan

3168
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,600
who will he send first

3169
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,600
two kinds of scholars

3170
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,800
The first was an anthropologist

3171
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:17,400
The second one is I don't know what academic

3172
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,500
but he botanist

3173
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:21,000
That is to say

3174
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,300
When the Japanese ruled Taiwan

3175
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:24,800
He did two very important things

3176
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:26,400
For a modern country

3177
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,000
everyone has interaction

3178
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,800
Every number gets better

3179
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,800
Do you understand what I mean?

3180
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,800
Only when he understands who he controls

3181
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:37,600
and where do these people live

3182
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,400
how many natural resources

3183
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:40,700
he is more sure

3184
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,600
because he is an outsider

3185
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,000
so you'll find that a lot of things are said

3186
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,200
he did it very thoroughly

3187
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,700
That's statistics

3188
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,700
That is to say, how do you make

3189
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,400
you in a short time

3190
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:53,800
A system capable of setting up an account

3191
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:56,300
You will let the land you control

3192
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:58,800
Every number slowly gets better

3193
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,200
he must be very thorough

3194
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
are you doing these things

3195
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
OK, of course it means you're going to research

3196
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
This is actually the history of statistics

3197
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
How does it start with something like this

3198
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Then you find out that Japanese people do things like

3199
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
he didn't invent it himself

3200
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Europeans do it

3201
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Europeans are going to occupy other places

3202
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
occupy elsewhere

3203
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
he should know before

3204
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
character of the place he occupies

3205
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
you just asked a lot of questions

3206
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
is a later development

3207
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Of course it was impossible to take pictures at that time

3208
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
OK that 1663

3209
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
you don't have a camera yet

3210
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
some jokes

3211
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
I say but images are very important

3212
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Because we know that a statistical graph

3213
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
A lot of Equation than you

3214
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
much better effect

3215
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Because the picture can be understood by everyone

3216
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
OK although a graph appears

3217
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
There may be a lot of inferences behind

3218
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
but i think

3219
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
A very important purpose of statistics is to

3220
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Let the average person know what adjustments you are making

3221
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
So statistics has many, many components

3222
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
There's a big part of it that we don't understand

3223
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
But there must be some parts

3224
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
For example, let's go to the official information now

3225
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,380
there must be some statistics

3226
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:03,320
that as long as you go online now

3227
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:05,480
Probably can be downloaded

3228
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:06,880
For example it must have this part

3229
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:09,800
is to allow you to find the information you want

3230
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,640
Then I would say that for everyone

3231
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:14,840
You must at least know how to calculate the average

3232
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:16,640
At least know how to calculate Medium

3233
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,080
that's fine

3234
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,720
This is called narrative statistics

3235
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,280
That is to say, give you a bunch of numbers

3236
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:24,000
you know which number is most likely

3237
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,720
what is possible

3238
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,200
that's an interesting question

3239
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,800
What do you think is all the numbers add up

3240
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,200
divided by its observed value

3241
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:30,720
still watching obsession

3242
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,160
This itself is a controversial issue

3243
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:33,920
that's why i say

3244
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,640
Statistics must have this part

3245
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:37,560
but of course that means

3246
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,040
The country should be doing this now

3247
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,320
But it can also have some consequences

3248
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,160
Because it's the shape of technology

3249
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:45,000
ok you do

3250
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,680
maybe its consequences you don't want

3251
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:49,080
Especially when it's not a democratic society

3252
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:50,160
ok

3253
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:51,040
anymore question

3254
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,480
still have a question

3255
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:53,280
you sign up

3256
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,920
yes

3257
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:55,800
good

3258
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:59,960
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

3259
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Then what I want to ask is what you just introduced

3260
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
the place where the scholar was known

3261
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
You said he was a pastor and you mentioned that he was

3262
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Cooking itself God himself has no way of knowing

3263
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
but you can see what he wants you to see

3264
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
So the question that comes to my mind is

3265
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Doesn't that mean if God wants us to see a certain part

3266
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Then we can only live forever as he wants us to see

3267
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
So in other words, Lin Gang also mentioned Sherlock Holmes

3268
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,000
As long as the criminal can make Sherlock Holmes

3269
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
only see what he wants him to see

3270
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
It is impossible for Holmes to discover the truth

3271
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
this is a very good question

3272
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
So recite the information left behind

3273
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Or have subsequent researchers explored

3274
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
is it possible

3275
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
It's that we can never know what we're looking at

3276
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
What do you think about this in the theory of back knowledge?

3277
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Great, I think this is a very, very critical question

3278
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
The first criminal's evidence is all here

3279
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,000
OK so a detective's job isn't that complicated

3280
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
You just have to be able to see tiny evidence

3281
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
you can make many inferences

3282
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
This problem is relatively simple

3283
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,960
But you now know why the base

3284
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:05,600
comboxbase it doesn't write its stats

3285
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,000
it writes theology

3286
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,600
the problem is very complicated

3287
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:11,200
about what god can show you

3288
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:12,700
that is a theological question

3289
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,200
Of course for a Christian

3290
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,100
for him

3291
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:18,600
God will never let you see things that will make you feel scared

3292
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,900
but how do you know it's true

3293
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,500
that is a theological question

3294
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,300
So there is a law that can be derived from its back

3295
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:27,800
find a clue that says

3296
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,000
God will show you one thing

3297
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,600
not for you to see once

3298
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,300
it will make you watch it many times

3299
01:55:33,300 --> 01:55:34,700
and not just for you to see

3300
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:37,100
it allows everyone to see

3301
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,200
know what i mean

3302
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,900
That is to say, this rule is applicable to everyone.

3303
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:43,700
If everyone can use this law to deduce

3304
01:55:43,700 --> 01:55:45,300
Isn't this the best way?

3305
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,400
if the work of moose

3306
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:50,100
Just to tell everyone what God is

3307
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:52,500
So it actually has a theological purpose

3308
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:54,600
but i think it makes sense

3309
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,400
That means

3310
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:59,800
This thing is different from statistics after the 19th century

3311
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,300
The statistics after the four seasons are probably very fixed

3312
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:04,300
Statistics has several basic assumptions

3313
01:56:04,300 --> 01:56:06,400
From these assumptions it can then be deduced that

3314
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,300
what is the best statistical model

3315
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:10,900
But like it doesn't come like this

3316
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:12,200
It is based on Prior belief

3317
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:13,400
What is Prior belief?

3318
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:14,900
anything can

3319
01:56:14,900 --> 01:56:17,400
But the point is you can always renew your beliefs

3320
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:19,400
So the point is to keep updating

3321
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:21,300
It's not an update, it's an update all the time

3322
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,700
Hello, I read Li Ke

3323
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:27,300
It's hard

3324
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:30,200
Get some enlightenment in this topic today

3325
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:34,100
In the past, I only heard that gorgeousness values ​​fairness and justice.

3326
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:36,300
What economics focuses on is efficiency

3327
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:39,000
that politics is a series of compromises

3328
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,300
Then today I finally saw the original in the compromise

3329
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,600
it has a statistical background

3330
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:45,300
And there is some basis for this competition theory

3331
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:46,900
So the question I want to ask is

3332
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,800
Today the teacher mentioned that

3333
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,100
Since it is an electoral system, it will affect the distribution of the entire political party

3334
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,600
then if we go back to

3335
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:56,600
If politics is just strategy itself

3336
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:58,400
there is a purpose behind it

3337
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,900
Let's go back to Taiwan

3338
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,760
Taiwan is a multicultural society

3339
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:07,000
In such a multicultural society, we can't afford the old-fashioned infighting over there.

3340
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:12,500
Based on the principle of no internal friction, it should be avoided that the two parties are just doing a rotation over there.

3341
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:17,000
Is that in the electoral system? I don't know from a political point of view.

3342
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Is it true that Taiwan is also going to be like a Huaguo?

3343
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Will there be more cooperation with the party?

3344
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
It's a little too late for you to ask the question

3345
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
because it's too late

3346
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
no i'm kidding

3347
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Why, because why is there such an electoral system now, have you ever wondered

3348
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Yes, why is it ordered by the big party, because he hates the small party

3349
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Talking about the Wenxian here is that you talk about those who oppose the system

3350
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
So is there going to be Wenxian who has a lot of Wenxian love here?

3351
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,000
In fact, he has a point, that is, I don't have time to talk about institutional theory today.

3352
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Because if you really talk about it, sometimes it will be very sad.

3353
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Because of some systems he is a minority

3354
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
It's not a few people, it's a certain group of people. After it is established, it will be standardized.

3355
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
If you don't do this, no, you won't have a seat

3356
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,100
So he will be very unfair to the third force or other minor parties

3357
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:06,800
But then it's like you're talking about politics compromising

3358
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,960
Why didn't he set a single constituency with two votes?

3359
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,300
pure unitary constituency

3360
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,800
Because we still have party-white negotiations

3361
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:14,840
Xiaodang said it can't be done like this

3362
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:17,140
He said that if you can't set the joint force system in Germany

3363
01:58:17,140 --> 01:58:18,700
At least make a case

3364
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:19,960
What does case system mean

3365
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:22,000
Even if you still have part of the country

3366
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,540
Little party still has a chance

3367
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,360
In other words, when will the small party have a chance

3368
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:28,940
When the strength of your two major parties is about the same

3369
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:30,480
small party will have some chance

3370
01:58:30,980 --> 01:58:33,280
But the problem is because it's leisure

3371
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:36,100
Leisure is a super high threshold

3372
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:37,380
everyone should know

3373
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,440
More than three-quarters of Congress agree

3374
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:40,200
then to

3375
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:41,740
almost impossible

3376
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,020
when electing president

3377
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:44,560
More than half of the electorate turned out to vote

3378
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:45,840
is possible to pass

3379
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,620
So it's impossible if he didn't tie the election

3380
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:49,420
But you say it's impossible

3381
01:58:49,940 --> 01:58:50,960
I'll see

3382
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,260
We can only say that now Taiwan

3383
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,560
The threshold for system reform is very high

3384
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,120
Then this threshold was set in 2005

3385
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:59,080
not yet

3386
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,500
That's all I can say, that's all I can say as a scholar

3387
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,500
Well, I think of course there are many ways.

3388
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
But now that we have a system

3389
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:10,000
Everyone is using this system

3390
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,000
I think it's better to follow it

3391
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:14,500
anymore question

3392
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:15,500
right

3393
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:19,000

3394
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Yeah

3395
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:23,000
EITM

3396
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,500
Because we now sometimes have to create some nouns

3397
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:26,500
it does not omit at all

3398
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,500
EITM就是Imperial Implications of Theoretical Models

3399
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,500
Imperial Implications of Theoretical Models

3400
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
is the empirical implication of your theoretical model

3401
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
it speaks vernacular

3402
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:38,000
for example

3403
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,500
it has a theory, right?

3404
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Give me a test, that's what it means

3405
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,000
Just say you want Imperial Implications

3406
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,000
sounds deep, doesn't it

3407
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:46,500
It's what you test

3408
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
what to test test me and theory

3409
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:50,000
It's called Theoretical Models

3410
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,000
That is, your model is not just a model

3411
01:59:52,500 --> 01:59:53,500
It's from Theoretic

3412
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
For example, we just talked about Divacient

3413
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:57,000
Is a Theoretical Models

3414
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Front it has Theoretic

3415
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
wired at the back

3416
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,460
help him change it to MODE

3417
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:02,420
can detect

3418
02:00:02,420 --> 02:00:03,120
What is detected?

3419
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:04,220
right or wrong

3420
02:00:04,220 --> 02:00:05,380
So it is IMPIRICLE

3421
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:08,000
it is an empirical test

3422
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,500
So EITM sorry

3423
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:12,160
Because of this in political science has become a JACAN

3424
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,400
Because I feel that POWPON

3425
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:15,120
I can't fit so many words

3426
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:17,120
it's not mysterious at all

3427
02:00:17,120 --> 02:00:18,920
there's nothing wrong with it

3428
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:19,420
no problem

3429
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:20,000
time has come

3430
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,300
i want to clarify one thing

3431
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:24,320
That's what Mr. Lin said just now

3432
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,420
like in the future

3433
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:28,260
I do not know him

3434
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:31,380
But because when he was studying, he

3435
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:32,380
In fact, when I was studying

3436
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:33,760
I help my wife with reading

3437
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,260
but i haven't seen either

3438
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:36,720
then like in the future

3439
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:38,720
He and I are around there

3440
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:41,140
I don't even remember coming with me in the hallway

3441
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:41,920
Always

3442
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:43,880
but i'm not

3443
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:45,680
I didn't come to talk about anything

3444
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:46,560
because he waited for me to come back

3445
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:47,720
yes i have graduated

3446
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:48,880
After returning to Taiwan

3447
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,680
one hour later

3448
02:00:50,680 --> 02:00:53,960
but before he died

3449
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:55,180
We had a teacher tell me

3450
02:00:55,180 --> 02:00:55,880
he not long ago

3451
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:57,380
i am on campus

3452
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:58,840
You see a continent

3453
02:00:58,840 --> 02:00:59,840
19 photos taken together

3454
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
beat him up

3455
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,600
He probably didn't really take a beating

3456
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:04,600
probably him

3457
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:06,200
it's this special person

3458
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:07,000
Look at the features

3459
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,640
He doesn't want people on the water level

3460
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,000
Scared him on the way

3461
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,800
yes

3462
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:12,200
So I pushed it around

3463
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:15,000
As a result, he soon became an economist

3464
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:17,400
When I received a big prize to do business

3465
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,000
From Canada Airport

3466
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,600
When it's time to go back to Briston

3467
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:24,600
died in a car accident

3468
02:01:24,600 --> 02:01:27,200
But there was a mathematician who colonized the world

3469
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,400
I can't tell if he is

3470
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:32,000
He was also a professor in Princeton's Department of Mathematics

3471
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:34,200
he told me

3472
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:35,200
he will think

3473
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:36,200
if he was joking

3474
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:37,200
I told him

3475
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:38,000
he said

3476
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,200
If you don't get that prize

3477
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,200
probably won't die

3478
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:42,600
he because we from

3479
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
from that airport

3480
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
back to princeton

3481
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,200
Are doing Airport

3482
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:50,200
Just a dozen people do it

3483
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,400
Eighty and thirty yuan per person

3484
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:52,400
those are poor

3485
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,200
Don't even talk about how much money you don't have

3486
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:55,600
yes then what

3487
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,600
How is he willing to spend 350 dollars

3488
02:01:57,600 --> 02:01:58,600
do that economy

3489
02:01:58,600 --> 02:01:59,600
probably

3490
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
got that

3491
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:03,020
Said that he is still proportional to 10 people

3492
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:04,360
8 times everyone

3493
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:05,000
so what

3494
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,640
money again

3495
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:07,080
