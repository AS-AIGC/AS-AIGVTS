00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
........

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, let us host the next broadcast, Ms. Wang Fan Sheng vice director

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Please give him a round of applause

4
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Welcome Professor Qu and fellow individuals

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Our knowledge feast is a very important event for our hospital to promote popular science facts

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Every month we invite lifted scholars from inside and outside the academy

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Experts come here to talk about the latest academic developments

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Today, there are 1.3 or 1.4 times in each month here are humanities and social sciences

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's all hosted by me in the Humanities and Social Sciences Association

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Today we are very honored to invite Professor Xu Wanwen from the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Center of our school to give a speech

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Professor Xu Wanwen is a graduate of the Department of Economics, National Taiwan University

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
After graduation, he went to Stanford University in the United States to obtain a Ph.D. in Finance

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Once taught at the University of Notre Dame and the University of California, Los Angeles

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He also served as the deputy counseling secretary of the academic counseling association of the college

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And there is a fertility support to see me

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Editor-in-Chief and Deputy Consultant of Taiwan Social Research Institute

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Professor Xu is also in the Economics Department of National Taiwan University

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,240
National Taiwan University Physiognomy Institute

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,040
Chuo University's Industrial Economics Institute

20
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,640
part-time professor

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,240
Professor Xu's research seems to me

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,480
There is one point worth pointing out again.

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Just when everyone is being very small

24
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,040
when limited in here

25
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,560
It's a minority that takes a lot of weight

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Overall Industrial Economic Policy

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Scholars with Industrial Economic Development

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,560
so its writings

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,240
including many

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,320
Among them, the following public language matters

31
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,880
Alternative Thoughts on Taiwan's Economic Development

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,000
Taiwan's economy under globalization

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,760
Mechanisms of economic growth, etc.

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,480
in 2003

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,840
it collaborates with an american scholar

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,080
A special book on the study of Taiwan's industrial upgrading

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
Published immediately from the public circle in the United States

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
There are many other works

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,560
These works are all about the upgrading of the industry

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,100
Post-war economic development and other related issues

41
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,600
In recent years, Professor Qi has also begun to conduct

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,760
Research on China's economic development model after the reform and opening up

43
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,440
he is in this

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,240
When I talked about the economic development of East Asia and other areas

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
All Fertility Scholars

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,500
Today he is coming to share with you a speech

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,680
After the inheritance of the Republic of China

48
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,440
The Inheritance of the Republic of China and the Post-war Economic Development of Taiwan

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,280
I think we have a lot to look forward to today's speech

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,640
We now welcome Professor Qi with warm applause

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,040
Thank you Dean of Protection

52
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,600
Thank you so much for listening to me so late

53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,640
come hear me say something

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
my research results

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,140
The topic I want to talk about today is the inheritance of the Republic of China and Taiwan's post-war economic development

56
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,000
Let me first explain why I want to talk about this topic

57
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,340
This is of course related to my recent research

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,440
After I returned to Taiwan more than 20 years ago

59
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,780
Let me start first, as Wang Fu just mentioned

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,060
I study Taiwan

61
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,680
Comparing recent economic development in the last 30 years

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,960
especially

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,620
Shangde Instrument is the industrial upgrading of Taiwan's high-tech industry in the past 20 years

64
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,720
But the more I research, the more I feel that we

65
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,760
It seems that Taiwan's economy has arrived

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,560
The recent transformation

67
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,340
is in a bind

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,900
That's the dilemma with its big background

69
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
So I gradually started to watch

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,760
Taiwan

71
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,800
just want to ask

72
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,380
The further issue is Taiwan's post-war economic development

73
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,660
how did it start

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,240
The more I research, the more interesting and complicated this problem seems to be.

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,240
So I became like half a historian

76
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,640
Maybe historians don't agree

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,440
But at least I also started to publish an article in Taiwan History Research

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Also published an article in New Historiography

79
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,440
even if the field isn't very... how to say

80
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
not taken seriously

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,800
But more and more I feel like looking at these things from a historical perspective

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,520
is very important and very rewarding

83
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,040
At the same time, I found it difficult to say things at the beginning.

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,800
That's me

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,960
The industrial upgrading of Taiwan's high-tech industry is not easy

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,160
But it is in the past sixty years

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Especially what can only happen on the basis of electricity in the past thirty years

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So I went back and studied the first thirty years

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
From 1945, 1949

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
especially

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I've been focusing on the 1950s lately

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Taiwan's post-war economic development

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
how did it start

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So this is what I've been doing for about ten years

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
a focused study

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
then my research today

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
In particular it will be

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
how to explain

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Taiwan's postwar economic development

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
this motive

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
quite complicated

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
that's what i found out

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In the process of democratization in Taiwan

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
how to explain

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Taiwan's Postwar Economic Development

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
In fact, there is a mainstream argument

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
there for

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Legacy of Japanese Colonization

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
special affirmation

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Also highly affirmed the role of the United States

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It is also highly negative for the national government

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm a little confused about this situation

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I also feel

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Backward countries all over the world must go through a process of decolonization

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That is to say, backward countries were more or less former colonies

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
then how do you develop your own economy

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How to face your colonial experience in this process

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
is a serious challenge

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm disturbed by how much I think about the present

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
For example, to give a very simple example

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
this May

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In order to commemorate the designer of the Jianan Army

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Batian language also see

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,200
his memorial park

125
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
into his memorial

126
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,000
President Ma also attended in person

127
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,000
The whole discourse is very grateful to him

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
then i was thinking

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
then we know

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
What reservoir and who built it?

131
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,120
we for

132
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
Who built such a reservoir?

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,800
do we know

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
are we grateful

135
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,920
Is there any criticism?

136
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
so

137
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,920
This makes me feel like saying

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,520
haven't we done it yet

139
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,920
be humble

140
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,120
to review

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,520
to confront past colonial experience

142
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,920
this is not just

143
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
that's all

144
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,520
Because what I'm trying to say here is to say

145
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,320
This is the same as our current

146
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Economic and political difficulties are related

147
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,520
then i hope

148
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,120
after i speak

149
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,420
can convince everyone

150
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
maybe it has something to do with it

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,600
I guess part of this dilemma

152
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,940
I think you don't need me to say more

153
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,240
everyone will agree

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,340
That is to say, it is a political dilemma

155
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,140
not what i want to say

156
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,940
But with the political dilemma

157
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,000
We also have our economic difficulties

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,540
We lack economic vision

159
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,100
We also lack how to go

160
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,160
pursuing economic vision

161
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,700
economic policy

162
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,260
At the same time I don't know if you have noticed

163
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,860
we don't talk much these days

164
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,160
a concept called economic vision

165
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,700
no one talks

166
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,740
This is of course a very dangerous thing

167
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,820
I call this an economic dilemma

168
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,620
What I'm going to say today is to say

169
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,700
why are we like this

170
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,280
I certainly wish to say that if I

171
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,360
My research is hoping to clarify this issue

172
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,400
then help us to be able to

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
then go

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
ok, let me talk about it first

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that is

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Taiwanese society

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Of course we are in Taiwan

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
have a lot of grades

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
for a while

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
we'll be called say

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
we have double miracle

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
our economy is a miracle

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
then for a while

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
we are very gentle

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
means of peace

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
achieved democratization

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Also considered a miracle of democracy

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So we say it's

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Tin-Lirical Double Miracle

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
very proud achievement

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
but everything

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
seems to have its price

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
then we are

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
i'm here to say

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
as we democratize

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
our society

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
a mainstream discourse

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
mainstream discourse

199
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
very powerful

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
very powerful

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
it goes deep

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but it doesn't

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We ask which scholar

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Did this write a book?

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Which scholar has established a scholarly basis for this without

206
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
but but everyone knows

207
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,520
it's baby talk

208
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,160
Can't bear it

209
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,040
good

210
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,920
Okay, let me briefly talk about the economic part

211
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,160
The prevailing discourse goes like this

212
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,760
is how to explain Taiwan's economic miracle

213
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,160
Because that part should be undeniable anyway

214
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,280
that would say

215
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,400
It should be the credit of Japanese colonial rule

216
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,680
or american role

217
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,240
If you don't want to be sure about this

218
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,640
That means the people work very hard

219
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
The most important part is the negative part

220
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,560
It is to deny the contribution of the Kuomintang and the National Government

221
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,120
Although it is said that economic development should be the responsibility of the national government

222
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,880
The best piece in the first year after the war

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,580
All other parts are subject to these discounts

224
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,700
This argument holds that the Kuomintang, for its own benefit,

225
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,520
Established a monopoly party-state capital

226
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,080
Obstructing the private sector is of no use to Taiwan

227
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,160
So it emphasizes the opposition to party-state authoritarianism

228
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,940
emphasis on nativism

229
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,000
Then with this support is

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,800
The neoliberalism of our economics

231
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,700
Compared with mainstream discourses in Taiwanese society

232
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,000
Blue Camp is basically

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,860
no words no discussion

234
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,920
ok then let's take a look

235
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,220
this

236
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,260
Taiwan economy

237
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,540
Development achievements

238
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,860
From the perspective of the world

239
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,660
how

240
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,940
ok this is

241
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,000
Medicine

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,560
experts in this field

243
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,860
he is very powerful

244
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,920
all countries in the world

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
this thousand years

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,500
a thousand years

247
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
All GDP counted

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,500
So my reliability

249
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Nobody knows

250
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,000
But it's our only basis

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
In recent decades

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Of course, the World Bank and the IMF

253
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,000
have some estimates

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But you said this hundred years

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We can only see him for a thousand years

256
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
ok let's see

257
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Postwar 1950 to 1998

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
he provided us

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Global We Divide Western Europe

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,500
United States Latin America Eastern Europe All Soviet Union

261
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Africa East Asia

262
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
1950 1998

263
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,000
their real per capita income

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
let's take a look

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Taiwan in 1950 was 936 yuan

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It was a certain one in 1990

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's count it in dollars.

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We saw

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,260
one tenth

270
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,340
By 1998

271
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,000
It is about 55% of the United States

272
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,840
We can see that

273
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm going to show you the Philippines

274
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,000
in 1950

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,140
The Philippines was a role model for Taiwan at that time

276
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,700
just younger friends

277
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,540
probably unbelievable

278
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,400
but at that time

279
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,940
The per capita income of the Philippines is higher than that of Taiwan

280
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,540
And everyone thinks that the Philippines

281
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,080
that time

282
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,140
If we look at the remarks at that time

283
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:35,780
Everyone thinks that the Philippines is more advanced

284
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,580
Everyone remembers he was an American colony

285
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,140
But in this nearly 50 years

286
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,580
in that time

287
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,380
The Philippines has only grown

288
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,740
only doubled

289
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,980
But Taiwan's per capita income has increased by 16 times

290
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,740
let's take a look at that

291
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,180
economic development

292
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,880
So economic development is a

293
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,380
how to say

294
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,980
a catching up process

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,360
In other words, you take the developing countries of Western Europe, America and Japan as a goal to catch up with them

296
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,000
So if you look at Western Europe and the United States, they are very mature

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,160
So the multiple of their growth is more than three times

298
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,960
Latin America's development is ahead of ours

299
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,160
But its development is also quite

300
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,960
Not developing well during this time

301
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,160
It only grew 2.3 times

302
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,680
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are backward

303
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Africa is also behind

304
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,600
Therefore, the countries in East Asia can be said to be an exception in the backward countries

305
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:49,760
That is, the speed of growth far exceeds the goal we want to catch up with.

306
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,520
Therefore, we have successfully shortened the distance between us and the target we want to catch up with.

307
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,040
Among the backward countries, very few

308
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,840
In the next 50 to 60 years, there are very few backward countries that have achieved this goal

309
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
so

310
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,840
let's look again

311
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,040
Because the one just now was in 1998

312
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,640
And then if we look at 2010 it's

313
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,080
The latest information we can have

314
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,040
Ranking of real GDP per capita of countries based on IMF

315
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,940
According to Purchasing Power Parity

316
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,240
deflating purchasing power

317
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
good

318
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,680
We can see that Taiwan ranks 21

319
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,640
Then this value is very high

320
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,140
More than 35,000 US dollars

321
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,340
This is a bit of a favor

322
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,080
But I guess this is showing that

323
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,240
In fact, we are very used to

324
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,140
Our prices in Taiwan

325
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,740
Very stable for decades

326
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,840
so everyone see

327
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,940
this japanese korean

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Japan we always feel that he should

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
His Life Scholar should be higher than ours

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But maybe it's because he's too expensive

331
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
so he flattened out

332
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
still behind Taiwan

333
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
so this is

334
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If we remove the first 20 middle

335
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
remove the words of several petro-states

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Taiwan should be

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Ranked 17th

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
ok so this is a

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
very remarkable achievement

340
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Then this development

341
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is also quite average

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
is stable

343
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
continuous

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's take a look at some important

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Economic Indicators

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Real GDP

347
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the first 30 years

348
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
nearly 10% faster

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
growing up

350
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So now everyone feels

351
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Mainland China is amazing

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
10% per year

353
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
In fact, Taiwan was almost like this in the first 30 years

354
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
no better than them

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That is to say, it is developing surprisingly

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
all at such a fast pace

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
growing up

358
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,840
We're looking at him because of the slowing population growth

359
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,960
so later

360
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,520
This growth slows down

361
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,240
But our per capita GDP is still growing

362
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,640
OK, let's take a look at the price index at the end.

363
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,200
that's what i just said

364
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,800
Because of the national government's fear of quitting

365
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,400
So the price stability is

366
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,640
is a policy objective that they successfully achieved

367
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
that's what i think

368
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,840
just why

369
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,000
Why this real per capita GDP can rank among the best

370
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,360
It is also because our price level is quite stable

371
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,880
Okay, so this is the achievement of our economic development

372
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,480
That shouldn't be too much of a doubt

373
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,120
an economic miracle

374
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Of course I won't say the other part

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,900
That is to say, in the first thirty years

376
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,720
The achievement of this economic development is also

377
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,620
but with fairly average

378
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,200
and more average

379
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,720
status of distribution

380
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,520
good

381
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,920
Let me talk about my structure first

382
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,560
that is

383
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,000
How does the country develop economy

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,560
Let's look at East Asia as a

385
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,620
few exceptions

386
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
what conditions are needed

387
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,020
We know that the road mutual countries have to learn

388
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,340
Western advanced production methods

389
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,540
their productivity

390
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,620
their technology

391
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,780
how they are organized

392
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,020
their business management

393
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,620
we all have to learn

394
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,020
But it's important to say

395
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,420
Although we have to learn

396
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,620
But we have to learn by ourselves

397
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,900
That is to say, we need to have our own space

398
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,300
to develop your abilities

399
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,140
grow our democratic industries

400
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,580
democratic business

401
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,080
at this initial stage

402
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,040
we need to get together

403
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,400
We need to resist this external force

404
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,700
because especially when you start

405
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,940
Your strength is so far apart

406
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,240
That is to say, for example, during the Japanese occupation

407
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Why Taiwan's local power

408
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,500
The power of industry developed so little

409
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,340
It was also because of the advanced power of Japan at that time

410
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,800
is so far away

411
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,300
Then you don't get policy support

412
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,500
But it's important to say

413
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,600
You must have such a motivation

414
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,700
a wish

415
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,300
You have to make a vow that I will do this thing

416
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,600
you need to be motivated

417
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
the will of such will

418
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,700
I call this the will to develop

419
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,400
The Will to Develop

420
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,200
We in social science tend to think of ourselves

421
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,300
become a science

422
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,400
So don't talk about this

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
this element of subjectivity

424
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,340
but what i want to say

425
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
it exists

426
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,260
Then we social sciences can't

427
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,100
Truly claiming that we are science

428
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,900
We are between science and

429
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,900
Between Science and Art

430
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,420
that number

431
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,900
the other two conditions

432
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,100
is the ability to drive development

433
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,020
This is it

434
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,620
is that you must be able to

435
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,220
go wrong about these things

436
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,420
yes there

437
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,440
The economy is dead

438
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
can you handle it

439
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
let us pass safely

440
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,240
it takes ability

441
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,680
that in addition

442
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,640
need some external conditions

443
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,920
what i want to say is

444
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,040
In the early postwar period in Taiwan

445
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,000
inherited by the national government

446
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,320
The old kings of the Chinese nation survived in vain

447
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,840
Chinese nationalism

448
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,280
since the Opium War

449
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,840
so

450
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,840
Developed over a hundred years

451
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,160
Chinese nationalism

452
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,240
plus

453
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
National Government

454
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Production and loan experience

455
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They brought their will to develop to Taiwan

456
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll wait for him to talk

457
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
what is the external condition

458
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So this is the architecture I explained

459
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So the following I will order

460
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Discuss these in order

461
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I Japan's Colonial Influence on America's Role

462
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The actions of the national government and its will to develop

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Then I'll discuss the role of financial bureaucrats

464
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Then I have to give them a name

465
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Ruguan, who is called saving the country by industry, takes Ying Zhongrong as an example

466
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Finally, let me discuss the development of the main body capacity and transformation of the new country.

467
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So this is my content for today

468
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay, so let's talk about Japan's role first.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:17,400
Ok this one, I should all agree that Japan has done a lot of things in Taiwan

470
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,600
Zhangliang land lays the foundation for modernization

471
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,000
It not only paves the way, but also introduces and establishes a modern system

472
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
with the organization

473
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But he mainly puts this part in a global perspective first

474
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That is to say, the imperialists and colonists have arrived in the colonies

475
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
most of them do these things more or less

476
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I once read an article where he compares different colonies

477
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
he has various indicators

478
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This is electricity, roads, what is the cost

479
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,800
What a bunch of indicators for universal education

480
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:09,640
Japan's colonies did not rank high on all indicators

481
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,920
I remember that it is probably ranked first in Taiwan Electric Power

482
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,320
but generally good

483
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,360
But it's not just Japanese imperialism doing this

484
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,480
Of course, the author thinks that the UK is also doing a good job.

485
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,320
he is an englishman

486
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,360
But he did collect those metrics for us

487
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,600
Then there is a display saying

488
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:41,280
Indeed, in order to carry out his colonial enterprise in the colony, the colonist

489
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,720
he has to do these things too

490
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,840
Well, so is Japan

491
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,560
He is in the colony of Taiwan

492
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,840
He mainly wants to turn Taiwan into a supplier of Mi Tang to Japan

493
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,160
But he thus helped establish a modern agriculture in Taiwan

494
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,040
and then indeed successfully

495
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,340
Make Taiwan a base for supplying Mitang to Japan

496
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,500
What we want to see is modernization and the establishment of modern industry

497
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,120
in previous decades

498
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,640
The modern industry established by Japan is mainly to control sugar

499
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,700
by the time the war started

500
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,860
It did some military industrialization in Taiwan

501
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,100
but

502
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
but

503
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,560
According to scholars I respect

504
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,160
Soil feast

505
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,860
he thinks that

506
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,800
because

507
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,300
Because Japan did not waver in Taiwan

508
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,800
The most fundamental structure of the landlord economy

509
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,000
Then modern industries are all Japanese-funded

510
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,500
so he thinks

511
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,200
He thinks Taiwan is not capitalized

512
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,400
Industrialization started after the war

513
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,300
Because modern industry is an enclave transplanted by Japan

514
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,400
The capital, technology and management personnel of modern industry are all Japanese

515
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,060
And the Japanese education system is also compatible with this arrangement

516
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,140
doesn't train natives to do things like this

517
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:24,580
Therefore, the colonial government organization and the Japanese and Chinese natives occupied

518
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,380
Occupies a relatively lower position

519
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:33,020
When it was accepted in 1945, people from the province who were appointed or above by the Japanese colonial government

520
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,080
only 2.2%

521
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,180
The most famous is Zhu Congming's 11 professors

522
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,760
But of course the important thing is this

523
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,820
temporary mobilization system

524
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,600
Is a

525
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,160
is a totalitarian

526
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,960
system of domination

527
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,280
Because we know that the Japanese are temporarily

528
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,840
he gradually

529
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,140
further deprived the landowners of their power

530
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,280
So it is a highly mobilized system for war

531
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,080
So he left a lot of room

532
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,880
Let the national government take over

533
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,000
But Taiwan is lucky

534
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,280
Japan's colonists are defeated colonists

535
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,480
so he must evacuate completely

536
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,600
is his advanced economic power

537
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,400
Including capital technology management talents

538
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:53,000
You could say he created a vacuum of talent at the top

539
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,200
But the entire advanced Japanese-owned enterprise

540
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,040
Advanced forces are also fully withdrawn

541
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,500
unlike in colonial times he was dominant

542
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:13,000
In the colonial period it was not only... I think it can be divided into two factors

543
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
One is that Japanese companies are of course more advanced

544
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The other is that the policy also highly restricts the development of local modern enterprises, at least in the early days.

545
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay, so Taiwan is lucky in this respect that other backward regions do not have

546
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
the colonists are gone

547
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We know many other colonists such as France who was defeated by Japan and kicked out of Vietnam

548
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
In the end, he actually said that he would return to Vietnam after four or five years.

549
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Just reclam this place

550
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,600
But so this is, for example, like Indonesia

551
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,900
He still has to fight a war with this Dutchman who was kicked out by the Japanese and came back

552
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,800
The independence movement of Indonesia is going to drive the Dutch out again and again

553
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,400
Just like Vietnam

554
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:29,900
Well so not even if politics won the Revolutionary War politically

555
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,800
This one for the colonists is not necessarily going to exit economically

556
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,900
Then Taiwan is our new master, the United States

557
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:47,100
Even the supporter behind the last one is also very tolerant

558
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:54,200
For providing aid and also tolerating Taiwan's developmental state to promote industrialization

559
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Then let me introduce a term called a developmental state

560
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,800
In our social sciences, it is called

561
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
development of state

562
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
refers to such a regime

563
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
its ruler

564
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
overall economic development

565
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
priority target

566
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
development priority

567
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
but very important

568
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
is that it is based on

569
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Overall development is a priority

570
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
rather than individual vested interests

571
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'll explain more later

572
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
ok that

573
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Speaking of Japan

574
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
that this

575
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
look at america

576
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
of course we know

577
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
America after the war

578
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
very very important to Taiwan

579
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
we see this year

580
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The two presidential candidates are still going

581
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
American Chamber of Commerce

582
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
speak in english

583
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
we know this

584
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
The role of the United States is still very important

585
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
good

586
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Well

587
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Without the intervention of the United States

588
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
if

589
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000

590
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
The Korean War didn't happen

591
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
america withdrew his support

592
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Maybe we are busy with reform and opening up right now

593
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
so i tried this

594
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That is to say, the importance of the support of the United States

595
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I think there is no doubt

596
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
After the Korean War

597
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Military Aid Financial Aid Various

598
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
back again

599
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Of course in terms of financial aid

600
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
To stabilize Taiwan's economy

601
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
is very important

602
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Because at that time inflation was

603
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
tens of thousands

604
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But what I'm saying is

605
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
We can't say these details

606
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
but i want to point out that

607
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
we are now

608
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
are rarely able to go

609
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
review

610
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Review our dependence on the United States

611
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Review says Taiwan's dependence on US

612
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,440
Influence on the United States on Taiwan

613
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,240
That is a very big topic worthy of our discussion

614
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,040
like when I was studying in America

615
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,880
Taiwan is so small

616
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,400
more than 20 million people

617
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,840
Our overseas students who went to Taiwan are in the United States

618
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,520
belong to

619
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,080
It can't be said that it belongs to the number two, but also the number two and the number three.

620
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,880
we can see this

621
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,440
is disproportionately much

622
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
even now

623
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
There is also mainland China ahead

624
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,200
there is india

625
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,880
but

626
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
Taiwan students

627
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
Then we are also complaining

628
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,680
Young Malays do not study abroad

629
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,440
what? What

630
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,000
so comfortable these

631
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,720
but even so

632
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,040
Taiwan students

633
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,240
Still in the top five

634
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,160
I'm in Taiwan for international students in the United States

635
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,400
still so many

636
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,880
So if we go and see

637
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,920
once i did it

638
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,400
researching i found out that

639
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,900
latin america

640
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,300
They are so close to America

641
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,500
Do many of them choose America?

642
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,000
No

643
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,640
you say middle east africa

644
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,740
you look at the ratio

645
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,300
Ratio to population

646
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,640
far inferior to Taiwan

647
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,000
So our entire Taiwan

648
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,900
and East Asia to the United States

649
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,700
relationship with the United States

650
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,640
very reflective

651
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,300
our political dependence on him

652
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,900
good

653
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
But what I'm saying is this

654
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,500
That is to say, the role of the United States is very critical

655
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,900
but

656
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,800
but we can't use dollars

657
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,000
to explain Taiwan's success

658
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,300
because

659
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,200
give two examples

660
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,300
First

661
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,800
in the mainland period

662
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
United States to the National Government

663
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,740
That's the one

664
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,340
The defeated America

665
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,500
And the national government

666
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,900
also provided more assistance

667
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,400
but no good results

668
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,000
Then everyone in the rest of the world

669
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,640
Also many most cases

670
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,340
no good results

671
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,540
so it's critical

672
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
but can't explain

673
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,440
But Taiwan is more fortunate

674
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
that's what i just said

675
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,100
it has something to do with us

676
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,340
one japan and one america

677
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,740
It gave Taiwan a postwar

678
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,740
Economically relatively self-developed space

679
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,080
This is of course an arrangement for the Cold War layout.

680
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,680
So the United States provides an umbrella for Taiwan

681
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,380
market

682
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
market is important

683
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,540
we are at

684
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,880
started in the 80s

685
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,580
we'll hear 3011 or something

686
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,180
But the first 30 years

687
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,680
The United States is quite prosperous

688
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,380
open its door

689
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,020
Enter Taiwan's

690
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Export

691
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,100
no apology like it started in the 80s

692
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,140
At the same time, it is not in the market of Taiwan

693
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
too small to be far from it

694
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,820
but at the same time it was for cold war political reasons

695
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,480
it tolerates the national government

696
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,060
The industrialization of various developmental states

697
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,700
to protect the domestic market

698
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,100
Supporting local industries and attracting foreign investment

699
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,900
For example, all these actions are

700
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,000
America in the late 80s

701
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,600
Start pushing the WTO

702
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
don't do this don't do this

703
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,900
It's from East Asia

704
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,100
Four East Asian Tigers follow Japan's ICSID model

705
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,400
Have you heard of the production review mode?

706
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,100
In fact, the Four East Asian Tigers are roughly

707
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,400
Following Japan's ICSID model

708
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,600
For example, foreign capital came

709
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
just ask for it

710
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,760
You have to train local suppliers

711
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,320
best for export

712
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Are you constantly increasing the proportion of local purchases

713
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,800
All of these are now banned by the WTO

714
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,000
so of course it is

715
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,720
Taiwan is actually

716
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,040
luckier in history

717
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,200
Of course, it was also due to the arrangement of the Cold War.

718
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,120
This is the opposite of what the US does in Latin America

719
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,920
For example, we know that Chile elected Ayed

720
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,600
Ayed is not just a leftist

721
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,920
And he's going to resist the influence of American corporations

722
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,200
He wants to nationalize the mines

723
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,920
Turns out we know he was overthrown in a coup and people were killed

724
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,040
At the same time the United States

725
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,700
after World War II

726
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,140
In 1946, the Sino-US Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation was signed

727
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,700
China fully opens its door to the United States

728
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:14,040
and only for the US

729
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:22,440
So it seems that the treaty seems to be still valid

730
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,600
I met a friend who works in the media

731
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,840
He said that now it seems that the movie imports something like this

732
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,180
still citing the treaty

733
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,240
i don't know

734
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,280
I didn't check this part

735
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,680
So what I'm saying is this is the paradox

736
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,280
That is to say, it is the strategic consideration of the United States towards China.

737
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:51,580
Make it highly tolerant of Taiwan's economic autonomy

738
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,700
Let's look at this more troublesome problem first.

739
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,200
It is how we view the role of the national government

740
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,500
i mean to say

741
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,300
We are in this process of democratization

742
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,900
because we want

743
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,000
that our society does

744
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
successful

745
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,000
relatively mild and peaceful approach

746
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,500
developed a discourse against authoritarian rule

747
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,700
This argument necessarily negates

748
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,500
deny many parts of him

749
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,000
Variety

750
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,900
what i want to say is

751
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,400
such a statement

752
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,900
It's what I just said

753
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Our current mainstream discourse

754
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,600
his staged tasks

755
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,400
should it come to an end

756
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,700
should we go

757
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,200
to review the issue

758
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,020
I guess I'm not saying this argument is completely useless

759
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,340
I'm not

760
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,900
i feel everything

761
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,500
Maybe we'll all have to look at it historically

762
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,340
For example, I just mentioned

763
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,340
How do we view this mainstream discourse

764
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,140
How to see the impact of Japanese colonial rule

765
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:25,580
If you want to deny the authoritarian rule of the national government

766
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,940
Of course it's easy for you to deny everything about him

767
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,640
Then say the Japanese are doing better than you

768
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,580
I just try to speak nice things about the Japanese

769
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,780
then say bad things about you

770
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,780
you can imagine this

771
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,980
This is an easy path

772
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,380
but today

773
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,180
Maybe we shouldn't take it so seriously

774
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,020
That way we'd better move on to the next step

775
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,220
what i want to say is

776
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,620
In this mainstream discourse

777
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,620
will put the national government

778
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,540
They just retreated and fled to Taiwan.

779
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,000
said to be a

780
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,340
outright alien regime

781
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,840
a colonial regime

782
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,840
It's very convenient to say this

783
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
it's easy

784
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,840
it's just really embarrassing to say it

785
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,740
easy to deny

786
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,340
but it has its price

787
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,840
Saying this has its price

788
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,440
then i'm coming

789
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,780
that is

790
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,240
colonial power is not a

791
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,700
freely definable

792
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,800
because it is a

793
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,740
imperialist architecture

794
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,040
that is, you have to have colonists

795
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,440
you have the colonized

796
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,340
at the same time

797
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,840
This colonization is for the benefit of the mother country

798
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,640
and there should be differences in levels of development

799
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
That is, the level of this home country is relatively high.

800
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,340
then it has the power to come

801
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,640
this

802
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
to occupy this colony

803
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,740
Then let the benefit of this colony

804
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,840
Serve home country

805
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,340
this is a

806
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,380
This one from the end of the 19th century

807
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,400
an imperialist architecture

808
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,600
under that framework

809
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,400
so we can talk about colonies

810
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,700
But treat the national government as a colonist

811
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,400
raised it a bit too much

812
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,000
because it has no mother country

813
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,200
it is defeated

814
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
retreat to a very deep

815
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,200
one without governance

816
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,200
It has only been governed for four years

817
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,800
a god brought back

818
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,600
In fact, when the National Government accepted the Northeast

819
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:43,200
also encountered similar trouble

820
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I guess it's the price of saying something like this

821
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,400
and then at the same time its level of development

822
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,000
Not particularly high compared to Taiwan

823
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,500
The point is not just saying

824
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,500
1. Once you describe the national government as a colonist

825
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,500
you don't

826
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
no way to point to the real colonists

827
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,440
Then you have no way to recognize our own place

828
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,760
you won't identify

829
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,840
You will not point out that Japan was once our colonizer

830
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,380
then America to now

831
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,200
still our important supporter

832
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,520
if you think about it

833
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,340
It's true that we don't usually talk like this

834
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,640
we only hear

835
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,700
The national government is a foreign regime and a colonial regime

836
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,500
we won't say what japan is like

837
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,780
how is america

838
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,160
At the same time, there is no way to realize that

839
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,480
When developing the economy in a backward country

840
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,800
its role in economic democracy

841
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,100
this

842
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,660
This way of thinking is different from what we have now

843
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,940
very relevant

844
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,260
Because our biggest difficulty now is how to get rid of

845
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,800
Facing mainland China

846
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,200
Then we are now the mainstream

847
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,200
is to continue the framework

848
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,040
the national government

849
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,520
original enemy number one

850
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,560
now enemy number one

851
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,120
to mainland China

852
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,040
Also put it in a frame like this

853
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,440
but the problem is

854
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,200
This is for us to plan

855
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,440
our economic future

856
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,840
economic vision

857
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,240
only brings difficulties

858
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,440
Because mainland China

859
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,080
It also

860
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,880
In fact, the economic benefits to the present

861
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,760
did not enter Taiwan

862
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,640
its level of development

863
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,560
not higher than Taiwan

864
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,600
It is Taiwan that is exporting capital

865
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,640
manpower to the mainland

866
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,760
so

867
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,200
Such a structure allows us to understand

868
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,160
National Government

869
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,080
to understand

870
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,600
Now the number one enemy is mainland China

871
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,520
are in the way

872
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
that's what i'm saying

873
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
we have no way to go

874
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
If you face this problem

875
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
is the prospect of hindering our development

876
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
well that

877
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
ok let's see

878
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
the national government

879
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
After retreating to Taiwan in a disastrous defeat

880
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
doing

881
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
First he did a very important thing

882
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
land reform

883
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
land reform

884
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I enter

885
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I also observed that in recent years

886
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
There is a very

887
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
In line with this democratization

888
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
and such a statement

889
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
there is a share

890
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
The voice is to deny land reform

891
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That

892
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Or

893
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Land reform is a foreign regime

894
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But the problem is the foreign regime

895
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It is not necessary to do land reform, is it?

896
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,940
Japan Comes to Taiwan Although Tibetan Land Cancels Big Tenants

897
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,040
But he didn't go further to do real land reform did he?

898
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,840
So foreign regimes and land reform

899
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,680
Foreign regimes may make land reform easier

900
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,740
But that doesn't mean he's going to

901
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:26,880
This is of course the communist revolution in mainland China

902
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,200
Under the Oppression of the Agrarian Revolution

903
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:36,100
Let those who had no determination to do this do it

904
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,980
But luckily with a compromise

905
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,280
Even the landlords in Taiwan actually compromised

906
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,120
did not rise up in rebellion

907
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,240
So it's a three way compromise

908
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,840
Land reform was carried out in a peaceful and stable manner

909
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,900
Of course this is for Taiwan

910
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,600
have a very important impact

911
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,360
because we see

912
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,200
Economic Development of COCO

913
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Hundreds of years

914
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,640
it's a long process

915
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,880
So how do we describe this development?

916
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,200
of course it is

917
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,840
the french revolution

918
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Britain's Glorious Revolution

919
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,200
is what to do

920
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,200
It is to overthrow the privileges of the feudal land aristocracy

921
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,760
then let this

922
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,760
The rise of the bourgeoisie who wants to do business and industrialize

923
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,880
That

924
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,760
Land Reform of the Nationalist Government

925
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,960
is a top-down

926
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,240
Bourgeois revolution

927
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,400
then why would you do it

928
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,360
is led by the Communist Party of China

929
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,200
Under the pressure of the land revolution

930
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,760
Then it eliminates the left wing on the one hand

931
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,960
It's 28 plus white terror

932
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,300
pardon his opposition

933
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,600
then under this pressure

934
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,640
he did

935
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,200
in order to maintain power

936
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,520
made some progress

937
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,320
including land reform

938
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,120
ok so look at that

939
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,680
this

940
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:24,320
Did the Nationalist Government establish a monopoly in Taiwan after the war?

941
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,860
party-state capitalism

942
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,180
Since 1991, Chen Simeng

943
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,740
the six

944
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,280
Facility Economist

945
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,860
Wrote a book called Deconstructing Party-State Capitalism

946
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,900
is a very famous book

947
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,180
that he

948
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,020
It represents such a one of our economics

949
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,820
free market theory

950
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,360
this democracy

951
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,180
To push is to overthrow authority

952
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,700
with a nice combination

953
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,020
so he was very successful

954
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,620
brought a term called party-state capitalism

955
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,900
so from that

956
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,020
very successful

957
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,080
Since then we have listened

958
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,120
Just got the name

959
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,140
party-state capitalism

960
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,200
but let's see

961
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,540
Is it true? If all the KMT did was create a

962
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,080
Monopoly

963
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,620
The party-state capital

964
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,920
How can Taiwan still be able to develop?

965
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,000
that would be a real miracle

966
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,520
That's actually

967
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,340
We can understand it by overcoming fear

968
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,620
the national government

969
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,460
So he received monopoly Japanese capital

970
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:35,060
Large enterprises remain state-owned but do not expand further

971
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,100
Taiwan Sugar

972
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,120
Taipower

973
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,160
CNPC what

974
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,260
Most of the emerging parts are open to the private sector

975
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,280
so

976
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,840
so i'll wait

977
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,120
show two pictures

978
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,220
One is that in the 1950s, manufacturing and industry

979
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,780
The proportion of private enterprises has exceeded half

980
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,340
at the same time

981
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,900
Taiwan's main private capital

982
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,600
are new post-war

983
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,400
This picture is very obvious

984
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,540
This is it

985
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,600
this is industry

986
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,300
1958 crossover

987
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,600
So this private

988
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,540
keep rising

989
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,500
The labor camp continued to decline

990
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
ok let's see

991
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,200
This is based on the Chinese Faith Institute

992
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,000
it came out in 2008

993
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Top 50 Group Enterprises in Taiwan

994
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,300
Then according to their founding years

995
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,700
take a look

996
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:53,100
Only 5 are from before 1945

997
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,800
It was very small before

998
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,200
for example

999
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
For example, Big Companion

1000
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
may be

1001
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
a small iron factory

1002
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I think this mountain should be

1003
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
There is also a telecommunications bureau

1004
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Another one is Wan Hai

1005
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Then the mainland came to Taiwan

1006
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
one is the same bureau

1007
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Later changed its name to Yang Ming Shipping

1008
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Because the mainland also has a bureau

1009
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
This was established during the Qing Dynasty

1010
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
The other is the Far East

1011
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
good

1012
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So that is

1013
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
see is say

1014
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Traditional industries in the 1950s and 1960s

1015
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and the financial industry

1016
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Cathay Pacific Yuanshou

1017
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
what starlight yuanshou

1018
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
These are mainly domestic market

1019
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
traditional manufacturing and service industries

1020
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
twenty

1021
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Another big one is the high-tech industry

1022
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Of course we know that he came after the 1970s

1023
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
established

1024
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,800
For example, like Shi Zhenrong, Lin Baili, Guo Taiming

1025
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,520
These are the postwar

1026
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,640
He may not be born after the war

1027
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,680
but educated after the war

1028
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,560
Lin Baili once said

1029
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,880
National Taiwan University's Department of Electrical Engineering failed very badly

1030
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,480
But let's look at their generation

1031
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,840
His class is amazing

1032
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,080
He opened with his classmates

1033
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,240
so successful

1034
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,280
so i don't know if he is

1035
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,720
what about his accusations

1036
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,120
we are hard to measure

1037
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,520
so their generation

1038
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,040
Taiwan's postwar-educated generation of engineers

1039
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,160
Help Taiwan build high-tech

1040
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
ok so this shows

1041
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
that's what i just said

1042
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Taiwan's main private capital is post-war star

1043
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
This is what I originally said

1044
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Modern Industry in the Japanese Occupation Era

1045
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Mainly Japanese

1046
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
and no japan

1047
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
did not train

1048
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Cultivate local modern industry in Taiwan

1049
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
It's dependent

1050
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
At the same time he also shows

1051
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
After the fearful national government came to Taiwan

1052
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
He is not like those authors say

1053
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
just means support

1054
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
party-state capitalism

1055
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
ok let's look at this background

1056
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
good this

1057
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
This is the KMT-CCP ​​struggle, line competition

1058
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:08,780
After the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation began on 1923 24

1059
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,740
Then they say

1060
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,340
2627 After the Purge

1061
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:19,300
The Kuomintang and the Communist Party started like this

1062
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:23,540
a very tough competition

1063
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:28,340
To seize the power to lead China's modernization

1064
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,340
We know that the national government failed miserably

1065
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:34,340
Let's look at 1949

1066
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,700
January 1949

1067
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,340
Chen Cheng Street Audit Chairman

1068
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:44,700
At that time, the People's Liberation Army was preparing to cross the Yangtze River

1069
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,140
just practice water combat first

1070
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:52,600
ship first

1071
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,900
So at that time we can negotiate

1072
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,400
There are eight conditions for peace talks

1073
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,700
Land reform Confiscation of bureaucratic capital

1074
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,900
Great Traitor Treaty

1075
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
The Mai Guo Treaty is the 1946 passage I just mentioned

1076
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So when Chen Cheng took over Chairman God in January

1077
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
He said there's little to die for from here

1078
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I think it can better show their mood at that time.

1079
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
he did a lot that year

1080
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
He immediately announced the implementation of the 375 inspection

1081
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
no legal basis

1082
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
he just does

1083
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It is true that the construction started in the first quarter of the year

1084
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I've never acted like this

1085
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
But Taiwan's conditions are better

1086
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
allow him to do this

1087
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Reform avoids wisdom

1088
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Exchange Taiwan Dollars for New Taiwan Dollars

1089
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Then start setting up a committee to plan Home Rule

1090
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
promulgate martial law

1091
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
There will be an official signing at the end of the year

1092
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
finally reform party affairs

1093
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
then white terror

1094
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Qing left wing

1095
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,700
ok then i

1096
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,700
Now I'm going to turn to this part of the economy

1097
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,700
At that time it was really stormy

1098
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,800
Economic crisis continues Hyperinflation

1099
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,000
fiscal deficit trade deficit

1100
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,000
Lack of foreign exchange Lack of supplies

1101
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
population and food pressure

1102
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,000
Then I think everyone should

1103
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,500
full of familiarity

1104
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,500
One or two million people immigrated from the mainland

1105
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,800
population pressure food pressure

1106
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,500
Then

1107
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,500
Lack of money, lack of supplies, lack of foreign exchange

1108
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,400
Although a shipment of gold

1109
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,100
but

1110
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,000
middle

1111
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,300
just keep selling

1112
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,500
You can see that its stock is constantly decreasing

1113
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,900
So this is very

1114
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,000
It is indeed a state of economic crisis

1115
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,840
But we see that within two or three years

1116
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,840
Indeed, these bureaucrats

1117
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,040
Ying Chongrong, Yan Jiagai, etc.

1118
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:13,320
They did stabilize the situation

1119
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,840
By 1952

1120
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,560
Production returns to its highest level

1121
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,400
Prices start to stabilize

1122
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,720
at the same time

1123
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,000
Although the population has increased by one or two million

1124
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,960
However, food is generally stable

1125
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,960
but i want to say

1126
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,960
Although the dollar plays an important role

1127
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,960
but

1128
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,960
not all

1129
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,960
because you have dollars

1130
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,960
like forty five to forty nine with dollars

1131
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,960
you can mess up too

1132
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,960
It's also a mess on the mainland

1133
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,960
a mess, a fiasco

1134
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,960
The national government came to relatively small Taiwan

1135
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,960
indeed overcome fear

1136
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,960
those are capable

1137
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,200
The financial bureaucrat came out ahead with his energy and job base

1138
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,200
to dominate economic affairs

1139
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,200
like pampering eye gel lids and more

1140
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,200
ok then take a look

1141
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,200
The source of these talents

1142
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
get to know them

1143
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,700
their background

1144
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,200
their thoughts

1145
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:29,200
that is to say why am I talking

1146
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
What about these talents?

1147
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,200
It's because of the constant chaos at this time

1148
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,200
At the same time we need to know

1149
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,200
The national government is indeed compared to the Japanese colonial government

1150
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,200
it is indeed a degree of modernization

1151
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,200
Organization is relatively low

1152
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,200
poor organizational skills

1153
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,200
A government with a relatively weak system

1154
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,200
We can say a semi-modern government

1155
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:57,200
So the role of these people is even more important

1156
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,200
Thanks

1157
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,760
Let's take a look at the resource committee

1158
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,860
Because he is a cradle of talent

1159
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:08,960
It is the Tsinghua War in Japan

1160
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,080
It is a very, very important event for China

1161
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,380
has its incredible effect

1162
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:22,020
Around 1932

1163
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:26,360
That is, 918 in Japan has already happened

1164
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:27,900
one or two years

1165
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,480
then there is already

1166
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,580
The situation of invading North China

1167
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,120
So there was a saying at that time

1168
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,700
That is, the North China University of Finance and Economics can no longer fit a peaceful desk

1169
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,240
that seems to be

1170
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,820
The student movement at that time was a famous saying

1171
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,920
So in 1932 the national government established the National Defense Design Committee

1172
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,480
some hopeful intellectuals

1173
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,000
in Beijing

1174
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,820
Big intellectuals are also willing to start willing to join

1175
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,140
Then start teaching and inspecting minerals

1176
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
what about

1177
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,540
In 1935, it was changed to the Resources Committee and the German

1178
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,100
cooperation with nazi germany

1179
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,540
then this

1180
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,740
Ke Weilin

1181
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,000
Wang Fu must be very familiar

1182
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,700
He is famous for speaking

1183
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:22,000
Cooperation between Nazi Germany and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government

1184
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,040
because after the war

1185
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,440
Germany lost any privileges of his imperialism

1186
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,800
so he becomes a

1187
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,500
non-imperialist advanced country

1188
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,700
only

1189
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,600
So he is very willing to follow

1190
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,100
Willing to help the Republic of China at that time

1191
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,000
to build a military industry

1192
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,700
what training

1193
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,300
train the army like this

1194
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,100
Just help me fight Japan in the future

1195
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,300
good

1196
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,200
it's really helpful

1197
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,600
on fairly good terms

1198
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,100
He mainly goes to change some

1199
00:59:59,100 --> 00:59:59,900
this rare

1200
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
metal

1201
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,780
During this two-person war

1202
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,780
is responsible for establishing

1203
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,280
we can see it was done in 1935

1204
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,780
Maybe Japan saw

1205
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,280
I think it's time to do it

1206
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,280
I have no idea

1207
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,280
1937 was like the Juqiao Incident

1208
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,280
so don't have much time to do too much

1209
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,560
Wartime MC is in the rear

1210
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,560
build some industries

1211
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,560
after america entered the war

1212
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,560
after pearl harbor

1213
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,560
beauty is coming

1214
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,560
after that

1215
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,560
The committee can send someone to

1216
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,560
The United States went to the commission

1217
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,560
front and rear

1218
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,560
More than 500 people were sent

1219
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,560
so a very big person

1220
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,560
very important thing

1221
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,560
first batch

1222
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,560
they formed

1223
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,560
Later, the 31 Society was established

1224
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,560
Because there are 31 people

1225
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,560
in may

1226
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
May 31

1227
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Then it seems to have forgotten

1228
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
exist

1229
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It seems to be May 31st

1230
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
set up their 3-one society

1231
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
who does that include

1232
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Shun Xuan

1233
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Also including Wang An

1234
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Later, Wang An Computer was established in the United States.

1235
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Wang An

1236
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Just this tiny tree

1237
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Wang Anliu

1238
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
stay in america

1239
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Most of them returned to the mainland

1240
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So after they got to Pearl Harbor

1241
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
such training

1242
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
helped China cultivate

1243
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
a lot of money

1244
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
very important talent

1245
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Then they simultaneously start doing

1246
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
economic planning

1247
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Just after the war

1248
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
what kind of industry are we going to build

1249
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
how to receive

1250
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
what kind of new

1251
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
What kind of new industry will be built, etc.

1252
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
very

1253
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
in their plans

1254
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
There are two places that are very important

1255
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
One is of course the Northeast

1256
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
because

1257
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
because this

1258
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
in Japan

1259
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Because China was really poor at that time

1260
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
no industry

1261
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
this

1262
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
mostly in the northeast

1263
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
another piece

1264
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
in Taiwan

1265
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
good

1266
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
We know that there is a big problem with Northeast reception

1267
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Russia

1268
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
japanese american what these

1269
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
but

1270
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Taiwan's reception is very

1271
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
very successful

1272
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
at least voluntary committee

1273
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
with the Chief Executive's Office

1274
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Perfect teamwork

1275
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
received

1276
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Relatively large

1277
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
enterprise

1278
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
voluntary committees in the national government

1279
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
should be a better

1280
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
this piece

1281
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Emphasis on professional enterprise talent cultivation

1282
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Absorbed excellent science and engineering talents

1283
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
relatively sound system

1284
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Their

1285
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,800
Of course, the previous photo was talking to Chiang Kai-shek

1286
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,200
Refuse the party's influence to enter

1287
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,640
Don't send your CC pies what pies come in

1288
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,840
and successfully rejected

1289
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,240
let it be a

1290
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,540
but also because of this

1291
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,240
The committee for

1292
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,440
last so corrupt

1293
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,140
The soon-to-be-failing national government was particularly disappointed

1294
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,700
So the committee is

1295
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,040
The only unit that is not as good as the investment

1296
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,640
so most people stay

1297
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,400
stay on the mainland

1298
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,100
You say Li Guoding and Sun Yunxuan are

1299
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:40,900
Are you here to vote for Taiwan?

1300
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,240
no they are

1301
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,700
sent earlier

1302
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,900
Taiwan to receive Taiwan

1303
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,300
good so

1304
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,700
The capital committee came to receive

1305
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,300
Top 10 companies established by Japanese-funded enterprises

1306
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:59,000
their reception is better

1307
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
it is a pity

1308
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,700
The national government will not send them to receive

1309
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,160
Research Commons

1310
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,700
Otherwise, there shouldn't be such a mess

1311
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:13,000
So it's better for them to receive more productive grades

1312
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,200
After

1313
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,960
These large-scale talents of the Self-committee are the cross-strait

1314
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,760
At the same time, it is the foundation of state-owned enterprises on both sides of the strait

1315
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,460
so

1316
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,360
So if we look at

1317
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,960
Older state-owned enterprises in the mainland

1318
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,620
Compared with the old public enterprises in Taiwan

1319
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:40,320
you see a lot of similarities

1320
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,420
When everyone is driving, go to refuel

1321
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,560
please pay attention

1322
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,520
Medium oil

1323
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,920
CNPC doesn't have a logo

1324
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,860
there is a word below

1325
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:56,620
That's the word committee

1326
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:58,120
Okay, so after the war in Taiwan

1327
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,220
Eight of the top 15 economic ministers

1328
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,200
from self-committee

1329
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,240
Rong Li Guoding in the movie

1330
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,760
Sun Yuxuan

1331
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,160
Zhao Yaodong

1332
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,200
Li Danghai and so on

1333
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:06,480
good

1334
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,840
Then I will be honored in the movie

1335
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,080
As an example

1336
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,080
Come

1337
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:14,880
speaking of this generation

1338
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:20,840
then i say this

1339
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,040
not to

1340
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,560
what kind of personality cult

1341
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,240
or what kind of meaning

1342
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,360
but to explain

1343
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,360
in this way

1344
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,640
a historical background

1345
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,480
to explain

1346
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Against such a historical background

1347
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,600
this group of people

1348
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,800
Have such a great sense of mission

1349
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,520
to help Taiwan

1350
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,120
in that chaos

1351
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,200
Laid the foundation for future development

1352
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,200
good

1353
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,880
then I will start with

1354
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,200
so here's what i'm saying

1355
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,000
that is

1356
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,120
In addition to ability

1357
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:58,880
ability

1358
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,200
Of course it's important

1359
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,000
work performance

1360
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,200
there is a crisis

1361
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,000
they can handle

1362
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,200
in mainland period

1363
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,400
This kind of people fight lightly

1364
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,900
yes of course

1365
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:19,400
always serious

1366
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,100
So those who are capable may not be able to stand out

1367
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,100
but in the last days

1368
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,600
This heightened sense of crisis

1369
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,200
make the ruler

1370
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,100
willing

1371
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,700
or he feels he must

1372
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,700
to those who can

1373
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,800
right

1374
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,800
I take the exempt occupation as an example

1375
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,900
I just want to use this to illustrate

1376
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,600
Will to develop

1377
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,300
1951 to 53

1378
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,800
There is a program called

1379
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,300
To be visited

1380
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,600
To be visited

1381
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,600
can be complicated to explain

1382
01:06:58,600 --> 01:06:59,600
but in simple terms

1383
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,300
imitation means

1384
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:03,300
government takes care of everything

1385
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,300
took American cotton

1386
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:07,300
Giving room battlefield

1387
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,300
It's like giving you a sum

1388
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,300
OEM money

1389
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,300
Then after the room is sandy

1390
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,300
back to the government

1391
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,300
The government put the housing good sand

1392
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,800
Take it to the branch factory

1393
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,300
then pay another

1394
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,300
branch fee

1395
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,500
then back again

1396
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,300
Then the cloth that was brought back

1397
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:26,300
Then give the marketing system

1398
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,800
resend

1399
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,800
So it's called generation imitation generation branch

1400
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
highly dominant

1401
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,800
this

1402
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,800
The choice of the man in the movie was at that time

1403
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,800
he said it was

1404
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,800
war time

1405
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
war economy

1406
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,800
then the mainland

1407
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,800
Chitai

1408
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,800
Mainland China

1409
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,800
This one from Shanghai Qiantai

1410
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,800
Fangsadin

1411
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,800
has come

1412
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
how many million

1413
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,800
this is already existing

1414
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
then i will

1415
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
give priority to supporting them

1416
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,800
because

1417
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
yes no more

1418
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Use foreign exchange to buy Dingding, Dingding, etc.

1419
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Therefore, the priority is to support the mainland to lead Taiwan to visit the killing field

1420
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Then so now imagine this

1421
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
How much controversy can be caused

1422
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
but he did

1423
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So when he was visiting the capital

1424
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
made a high degree of trade-off

1425
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
made a lot of decisions

1426
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and then there are highly criticized

1427
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
For example, like Lei Zhen's Free China

1428
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I also saw articles criticizing him

1429
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
then say

1430
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
because we can imagine saying

1431
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
how much trouble can happen

1432
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
That's the one someone secretly sold

1433
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Somebody profited from it, what, what, what

1434
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,000
At the same time, give priority to supporting the leading Taiwan in the mainland

1435
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
visit killing field

1436
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,600
There are also articles criticizing Free China

1437
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:08,000
How can Taiwan have such a scale to develop imitation teacher industry

1438
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
might as well import

1439
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,360
So on that example

1440
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,840
I think Free China may not be right

1441
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,520
but it's messy

1442
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,600
But in the summer of 1953

1443
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,600
succeeded two years later

1444
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,280
achieved autonomy

1445
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,360
at the same time

1446
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,120
Wu Zhongrong immediately announced the end of this Program

1447
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,720
That is to say, for these

1448
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:39,320
It turns out that he fostered the support of the object

1449
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,720
he tested

1450
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,280
At the same time, gradually open up new manufacturers to enter

1451
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,960
promote market competition

1452
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,680
Slowly Tainan Bang also came in

1453
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:51,960
what wait

1454
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,400
So four years later

1455
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,000
is completely open

1456
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
he used to have

1457
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,820
During this process

1458
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,660
he once said

1459
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:09,220
The factory is not ready yet

1460
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,780
written agreement

1461
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,840
The product is not yet in large quantities literally

1462
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,920
The request to restrict the establishment of factories has been put forward

1463
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:18,680
so

1464
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,500
So it means that in this process

1465
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,300
individual

1466
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,360
Manufacturers are constantly asking

1467
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,680
Your protection of me continues

1468
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,440
so

1469
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,780
no matter what

1470
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,340
I this this is all kinds of protection

1471
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,120
but he ended up

1472
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,660
open all

1473
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,760
So what I'm saying is that he set up various individual interest requirements

1474
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,560
petition basis for dating

1475
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,880
The benefits of overall long-term development come in the form of

1476
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,160
of course

1477
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,720
Offended a lot of people in the process

1478
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:54,540
good

1479
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:59,400
Let me continue with the example

1480
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,700
it was in 1951

1481
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:04,000
it said a famous saying

1482
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,500
Imported cloth is not as good as imported yarn

1483
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,100
Imported yarn is not as good as imported flowers

1484
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,800
put down cotton juice

1485
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,100
It is not as good as upstream and downstream to develop together

1486
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,100
It is cotton and then put raw yarn

1487
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,700
Yarn sausage is a relatively capital-intensive

1488
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,500
this production activity

1489
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,700
and then after yarn

1490
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,900
then there is branch cloth

1491
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,300
Cloth

1492
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,400
Although at that time

1493
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,900
Of course, it is all powered by cloth

1494
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,700
But it can be smaller

1495
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:36,700
So yarn sausage and cloth sausage are separated

1496
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:37,500
That is to say

1497
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,000
They are upstream and downstream

1498
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,500
interests between them

1499
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,900
there will be conflict

1500
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,500
good

1501
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,200
So it has to develop a set of

1502
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,700
To reconcile the interests of upstream and downstream

1503
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,700
So it is giving upstream

1504
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:56,700
Sasa

1505
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,200
While providing trade protection

1506
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,000
it for it

1507
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,240
Its price, quality and protection period are limited

1508
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,000
that is

1509
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:04,500
good

1510
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,640
you can act like a fool

1511
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,840
Then I'll give you two or three years of protection

1512
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,540
Protection means I restrict imports

1513
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:16,140
But your quality must meet the downstream needs

1514
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,140
branch factory needs

1515
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,840
At the same time your price cannot exceed

1516
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,040
25% of the import price

1517
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,540
for example

1518
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,340
So you see this is a

1519
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,440
I study economic development

1520
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,780
I think it's a very important

1521
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,340
institutional innovation

1522
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:38,340
its protection is conditional

1523
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,480
There is a deadline

1524
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,080
i just said

1525
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,680
that is two or three years

1526
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,640
Then your price cannot exceed

1527
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,280
How much is the international price

1528
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,980
Then your quality should be in a reasonable range

1529
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,180
Can't say that downstream comes to quarrel with me every day

1530
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:54,040
say your disagreement

1531
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,280
But if you're in the range

1532
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:56,980
if possible

1533
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,020
Downstream must endure for two years

1534
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
so this is a set

1535
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
what say this is

1536
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
An innovation made by Taiwan

1537
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Of course, South Korea also imitated this later.

1538
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So this is the East Asian model

1539
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
The key to outperforming Latin America

1540
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
It means that the protection is limited and conditional

1541
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
You didn't protect your childish industry and couldn't grow up

1542
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
But if your protection lasts

1543
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
it doesn't grow

1544
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
so this is

1545
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
that time in difficult times

1546
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
it is based on actual needs

1547
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
solve this problem

1548
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
It's not signing money

1549
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But it really wants to solve the problem

1550
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
so they don't stop it

1551
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
they figured out this way

1552
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Later also legislated

1553
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
there is such a law

1554
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So its principals have a clear vision for development

1555
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
is to make Taiwan

1556
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Complete the great cause of establishing a modern industrial production system

1557
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,600
so he has a clear vision

1558
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,000
Therefore, except in the 500th generation, he

1559
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,700
In addition to the development of tied branches and leaves in the way of integration from top to bottom

1560
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,900
He also started to promote the original fiber in the 500 generation

1561
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:26,900
Do we grow up in Taiwan and feel that it should be like this?

1562
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,900
what's the big deal

1563
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,700
Isn't that the way things should be?

1564
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,600
But if we look at other backward countries

1565
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,800
We found out that except for South Korea

1566
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,800
no other country does this

1567
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,100
That is, other countries use US dollars to import and kill

1568
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,600
or imported cloth

1569
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,200
Unlike Taiwan and South Korea

1570
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:56,000
cotton is imported in US dollars

1571
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,600
like pakistan and india

1572
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,000
they produce their own good

1573
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
They have also developed a non-visit industry

1574
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But after the development, they are busy fighting each other.

1575
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
So there is no further development

1576
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
not like Taiwan

1577
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Because of the development of exemption from visits, the development of rash

1578
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Dr. Chen, then Immortal, then Mixed Defense, etc.

1579
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
all the way down

1580
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
So like now we have many

1581
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
like plastic bottles or something

1582
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Those are the original raw materials

1583
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
This is the Coliac

1584
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
what these started making plastic bottles

1585
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It's moved downstream

1586
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
upstream and start doing something else

1587
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So Taiwan actually relies on this business of visiting

1588
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
long meal

1589
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
moggy in wollin soon

1590
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Taiwan is indeed a small market

1591
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
There is a surplus of non-visit business

1592
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
So 1960 had this

1593
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
famous policy turn

1594
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
From import substitution to export subsidies

1595
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,340
Since then, Taiwan has entered into a rapidly growing export-led growth

1596
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,600
Okay, so what I'm trying to emphasize here is that

1597
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:18,640
The concept and practice of this set of industrial policies after the war is a kind of institutional innovation

1598
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,940
it's from them

1599
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:26,440
At that time, I worked very hard to solve the crisis and difficulties at that time.

1600
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:33,440
Then this set of practices laid the foundation for Taiwan's economic construction policy in the decades after the war

1601
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,440
That is, our entire economy later

1602
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,440
Later these

1603
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:44,440
The Beauty Association, the Work Committee, the Economic and Security Council are all merged into the Ministry of Economic Affairs

1604
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,440
Then a part goes to the Ministry of Economic Affairs

1605
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,440
Then the predecessor of the Economic Association was established

1606
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,440
Then this system continues to the present

1607
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:00,440
Of course it's very different now

1608
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,440
ok let me say it again

1609
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:07,000
background of movie glory

1610
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,840
that's what he's going to do

1611
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,600
Of course it will cost a lot

1612
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,680
That is to say, I have just emphasized

1613
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,640
That is to say, the national government at that time

1614
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,240
yes it's still confusing

1615
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,680
This system is not perfect

1616
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,720
The organization is not perfect

1617
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:29,800
Then we Chinese are very good at putting pressure on each other

1618
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,400
Guan Qiang's light pressure is happy once

1619
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,800
So Ying Zhongrong's style

1620
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,760
Of course I made a lot of enemies

1621
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:43,000
So he was accused in 1955

1622
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,880
Talking about the Yang Zimu financial case to benefit others

1623
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,560
dismissed from office

1624
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,880
Then apparently he offended his officer too

1625
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,520
So he didn't protect him

1626
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,800
So he was dismissed for two years

1627
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,960
but paid

1628
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
He still maintains his style

1629
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
is the courage to recognize

1630
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
then take

1631
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
make very high-risk decisions

1632
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Then he was in 1953

1633
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
when writing a letter to a friend

1634
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Talking about the country's crisis, I was born at the age of 50

1635
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
as long as you can work hard

1636
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
another ten years

1637
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Even death is not courageous

1638
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
also with Cheng Chan

1639
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
He did write this after

1640
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
died ten years ago

1641
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Then he spent his life

1642
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Guo Songtao

1643
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Guo Songtao was in the late Qing Dynasty

1644
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
The Westernized National Salvation Faction in the Xianghuai Army

1645
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Ambassador to the UK

1646
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
wrote Jicheng

1647
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It is recommended to adopt the Western system

1648
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
then be infinite

1649
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
dismissed from office and died in depression

1650
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So this is his example

1651
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
but

1652
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
but also his

1653
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
lessons learned

1654
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Because Guo Songtao is not a good person

1655
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
after dismissal

1656
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Cursed his enemies in private

1657
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
so difficult to recover

1658
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So this Wu Zhongrong is

1659
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Being scolded off, being scolded all day or being scolded

1660
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
He doesn't scold anyone in private

1661
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
So someone guessed

1662
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
On the one hand, he takes Guo Zhongyou as an example

1663
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
On the one hand, it is also a lesson from others

1664
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Don't scold others in private, don't scold even one enemy

1665
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
sure enough

1666
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
From 1957 to 63 years after his death

1667
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
he served five years

1668
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Indeed he has many enemies

1669
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
After his death there was talk of an attack

1670
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
some people objected

1671
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Some entrepreneurs say

1672
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
We're going to start a foundation to raise money for him.

1673
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Someone rushed over and tore off the fundraising cloth

1674
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
so he does have his enemies

1675
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
well that

1676
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
but i take

1677
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
example in the movie

1678
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
but

1679
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
There are many other forces in the same period

1680
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
That is, let's see him write this letter

1681
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
it's for his friends

1682
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
They are of the same generation

1683
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
the same feelings

1684
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
they think we should

1685
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
do something like this

1686
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
so

1687
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
We must start from the background of this generation

1688
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
to understand

1689
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So I call them

1690
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
An official who serves the country through industry

1691
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
instead of

1692
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
what we understand now

1693
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
They seem to be more moral financial bureaucrats

1694
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I think

1695
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It doesn't seem like this

1696
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
cannot fully represent their

1697
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
this state

1698
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I

1699
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
here is a big

1700
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
There are some

1701
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,000
the case

1702
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
like what would he do

1703
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
high risk things

1704
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
For example once

1705
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
A batch of imported materials

1706
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Single brother due to tax dispute

1707
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,800
To keep these materials from rotting

1708
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,200
Take the initiative to provide guarantees by the CITIC Bureau

1709
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,300
Then he repeatedly decided to get a loan from the CITIC Bureau

1710
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,200
For private enterprises in financial difficulties

1711
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,300
poplar wood

1712
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,700
Then, for example, he disregarded the opposition of the army

1713
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,600
Ritsu manufactures military shoes with Shinsan leather

1714
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,200
Develop leather industry

1715
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,200
Against the objections of the Bureau of Zero Objects

1716
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,100
Import Liuwan, develop the deck industry, etc.

1717
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:33,800
so he

1718
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:37,600
He has the courage to make enemies and this cut

1719
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,200
we'll now feel like saying

1720
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,600
This kind of decision-making that seems to have the risk of benefiting others

1721
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,400
and he

1722
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:48,500
that is

1723
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,900
after dismissal

1724
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,500
he still maintains

1725
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,200
such style

1726
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:07,000
ok then i should close it soon

1727
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
so i just said

1728
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'm not trying to make it into a cult individual

1729
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
is not what it means

1730
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Rather, it must be under the background of that era

1731
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Let them be a little reckless and do these things

1732
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
their sense of mission

1733
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Then that environment also needs such a person

1734
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Only in the absence of system and lack of organization

1735
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
then an economy

1736
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Economically chaotic situation to solve the problem

1737
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
and then fix the problem

1738
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
in the process of problem solving

1739
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Founded Taiwan

1740
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
foundation of economic development

1741
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
so

1742
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
So the process is very dependent on

1743
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
motivation of these people

1744
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And then I'm going to talk about their motivation

1745
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
originate from

1746
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Inheritance of the Old Wang Tucheng of Chinese Intellectuals

1747
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
and during the KMT-CCP ​​struggle

1748
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
By the National Government

1749
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
their disastrous experience

1750
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
and because they were

1751
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Defeated by the revolution of the Communist Party of China

1752
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
so they borrow sex fear

1753
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
purge the left

1754
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
white terror very bloody

1755
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
but on the other hand

1756
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Also use the fear of sex to follow the Three People's Principles

1757
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
The development model of military endowment

1758
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
At the same time, due to land reform

1759
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
this china

1760
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,840
The Land Reform of the Communist Party of China The Success of the Land Revolution

1761
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,900
made them attach great importance to agriculture

1762
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:09,640
So throughout the 1950s and 1960s

1763
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,280
sixty

1764
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,560
Mainly the 1950s for agriculture

1765
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,620
is very important

1766
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,160
part of agriculture

1767
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,160
Agricultural Restoration

1768
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,800
The Peasant Rehabilitation Conference is also ours

1769
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,600
tell a similar story

1770
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,200
but of course he has his price

1771
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,960
just cleared the left wing

1772
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,600
So this is the disappearance of the left eye

1773
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,360
This is Chen Yingzhen

1774
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:38,320
is our famous writer

1775
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,720
his terms

1776
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,360
that is to say he said

1777
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,600
Taiwan is a society where the left eye does not disappear

1778
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,320
The left eye may not be very important

1779
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,320
But your lack of a left eye is an imbalance

1780
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:57,720
ok so i gave them a name

1781
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,960
They are not just economic bureaucrats

1782
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:08,000
It is the traditional intellectuals who save the country with industry and save the nation.

1783
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,840
Finally, let me talk about the hardworking people

1784
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,800
because i didn't just say

1785
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,000
In our mainstream discourse, there are three

1786
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Either Japan or the United States or the people

1787
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:24,400
but of course our people work hard

1788
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,840
We are still working hard

1789
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,160
Look we are now 8:30

1790
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,160
still doing it here, isn't it?

1791
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:37,160
Taiwan's working hours have been among the longest in the world

1792
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:38,160
Out at the top

1793
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:41,160
It seems that South Korea is number one compared to us and is second

1794
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,160
The focus is on the development of backward countries

1795
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:54,160
Not because, mainly not because their people don't work hard

1796
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,160
You said that China has been

1797
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,160
Did the people not work hard before?

1798
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,000
So I guess it shouldn't be a main explanatory variable

1799
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I am emphasizing here the role of economic bureaucrats

1800
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,000
i now go back to the whole noun

1801
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
It is because the economic development of backward countries requires good economic policies

1802
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Because you are behind, you have to catch up

1803
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
You used to be from a traditional agricultural society

1804
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
What was your original system?

1805
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
For the imperial examination, you have to write eight-legged essays

1806
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
then what

1807
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
For entering an industrial society

1808
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Of course not well prepared

1809
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
next to you is facing

1810
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Very advanced productivity in Europe, America and Japan

1811
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
you have to do

1812
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You certainly need the government to play a very important role

1813
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
So the more backward the role of the government is, the more important it is

1814
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So it's not that the people don't work hard

1815
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,440
It's not that people don't matter

1816
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,240
but you fall behind

1817
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:05,760
The more you need a focus

1818
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,680
collective power

1819
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,240
to solve the problem

1820
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,240
Japanese Occupation Period

1821
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:12,800
Of course the Japanese colonial government

1822
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,040
is a relatively modern

1823
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,240
More Advanced Governance Organization

1824
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,040
but

1825
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,840
But the Japanese colonial government

1826
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,240
not willing

1827
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,600
its will is to develop

1828
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,840
the economy of their home country

1829
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,040
it has no will

1830
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,040
no will to develop

1831
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:38,600
local power

1832
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:39,800
So the Japanese occupation period

1833
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,640
Although the foundation was laid

1834
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,680
established the system

1835
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,840
But it suppresses the local

1836
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,200
economic vitality

1837
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,840
After the environment is suitable

1838
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,080
will be able to play

1839
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:53,600
Just like the coastal areas after China's reform and opening up

1840
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,680
Simultaneous Japanese Occupation Period

1841
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,960
limited higher education

1842
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,920
Keep an eye out for talent in an era dominated by America

1843
01:27:58,920 --> 01:27:59,920
Difficult to play

1844
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,900
make the contradiction more prominent

1845
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:06,800
But in fact

1846
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,800
Authoritarian repression knows no provinces

1847
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,360
Because the asset management committee invests in the mainland

1848
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,560
So the resources will be in Taiwan

1849
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,600
Although the role of these people is very important

1850
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,560
But I believe that you may not have heard of

1851
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,960
Because as a ministerial unit

1852
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,840
He voted collectively

1853
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,000
The first step of the national government is to kill chickens and enter the marquis

1854
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,300
after they voted

1855
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,240
Compare Taitang with Taipower

1856
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:38,200
Dr. Liu MeiGeneral Manager

1857
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,240
out of death

1858
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,240
Espionage case

1859
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,740
After the Chicken Killer enters the Marquis

1860
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:45,600
After killing chickens and entering Hou, the capital committee was reorganized

1861
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,700
But these talents are still necessary

1862
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:49,700
So use it

1863
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:52,800
So this becomes a less

1864
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,800
Frequently Discussed Topics

1865
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,060
Okay, finally let's have some

1866
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
in conclusion

1867
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,700
OK, I said it earlier

1868
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,200
That is to say, backward countries

1869
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,000
to develop the economy

1870
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,700
Yes, we can simply say three conditions

1871
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:14,100
the first is

1872
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,800
external conditions

1873
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,400
You see, this depends on history

1874
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,800
historical situation

1875
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,600
Sometimes there is no such condition

1876
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,200
sometimes

1877
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:27,600
external conditions

1878
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:31,600
The second is whether you have this

1879
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,400
ability to drive development

1880
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,300
The third is what I just said

1881
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:37,800
What I have been emphasizing here is that

1882
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,600
Will to develop

1883
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,200
on the ruler

1884
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,400
cooperating people

1885
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,400
Do you have the will to promote development

1886
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,400
We can see that

1887
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:51,600
Just in Taiwan in the early postwar period

1888
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,400
There is such a cold war environment

1889
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,400
that is

1890
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,600
America for

1891
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,600
Under the layout of the cold war

1892
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,100
to contain the middle

1893
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,660
The CCP is willing to support the Nationalist Government politically

1894
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:09,460
But give room for development economically

1895
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:14,340
So it's certainly an advantage

1896
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:18,340
At the same time, the Japanese colonial government laid a good foundation

1897
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:23,460
But the daily role of the Cold War environment

1898
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:28,260
Cannot fully explain Taiwan's development achievements

1899
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:35,720
Very important is a dynamic condition

1900
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,920
On the development of the main capacity and transformation of the new country

1901
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:40,760
when we see it we say

1902
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,760
Internship in the National Government of the Mainland

1903
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,920
It is still a relatively backward government

1904
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:51,420
It's... call it light modernization

1905
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,720
It lacks the organizational capacity to effectively rule a vast continent

1906
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,680
Some people joke that its decree does not leave Nanjing

1907
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,600
that maybe a little more

1908
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:09,900
After moving to Taiwan, the national government

1909
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:14,200
Retreat to 10% at the expense of the central government

1910
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:16,200
it has accumulated enough talent

1911
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,400
The experience of failure and the motivation for development

1912
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:24,800
I think this fits with the foundation left by Japan

1913
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:29,700
U.S. assistance made this development possible

1914
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:33,100
But what I want to emphasize is that

1915
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:36,700
The will of the subject's dynamic development is still the key

1916
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:42,700
Let's look at the Philippines from 1950

1917
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,700
The income of reinforcements is higher than that of Taiwan to this day

1918
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:50,700
Their financial woes, then I guess it goes without saying.

1919
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:55,100
I think this is his condition.

1920
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,700
very lacking

1921
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,500
Well, knowing this comparison allows us to understand where we come from

1922
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,360
Then I hope this helps us

1923
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,860
where can we go

1924
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,660
Good Jingyuan

1925
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:18,200
In Taiwan's democratization process

1926
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,500
The transformation of the developmental state has not been entirely successful

1927
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:26,560
not totally unsuccessful but not totally successful

1928
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:28,560
that is

1929
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,900
Because once when I was talking about these issues

1930
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:36,000
someone just said

1931
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,160
Yes, democratization has these problems

1932
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:41,660
But are we going back to authoritarian rule?

1933
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:45,760
What I say is definitely not anti-historical.

1934
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,000
as if we had a choice

1935
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,860
Press a button again, democratic authority

1936
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,000
It means that of course we have to review at any time

1937
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,360
review what we have done

1938
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,360
did not do well

1939
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Then we will be able to solve our problem shall not

1940
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Then our predicament needs no explanation

1941
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Everyone should feel that we are at least economically

1942
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
is in a bind

1943
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I have said more about this part elsewhere.

1944
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I'll just say it here

1945
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Just in the first thirty years it was a

1946
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
economic development in command

1947
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
You can see that such a crisis is

1948
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Steady by overcoming fear

1949
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
but to develop

1950
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Of course development is priority

1951
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
This dynamic over everything else is very clear

1952
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
But with the development of society and economic development

1953
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Of course this has to be adjusted

1954
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
But in the process of democratization

1955
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
These adjustments were not very successful

1956
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
A compromise between other social requirements and development goals

1957
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,160
We're very partisan right now

1958
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:03,960
so this

1959
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:06,760
and the denial of developmentalism

1960
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,160
not easy

1961
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,200
At least not yet

1962
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,920
create a reasonable

1963
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,560
policy formation model

1964
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,600
Because of the policy we of course have to be a compromise

1965
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,160
you can't tell me today

1966
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,000
all nuclear power

1967
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,120
then we

1968
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,320
What do you rely on to generate electricity, right?

1969
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,320
you must

1970
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,400
there is a fold

1971
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,760
do you have a time table

1972
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,400
are you

1973
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,760
what price to pay

1974
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,160
Are you willing to do it?

1975
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,760
do we have a time table

1976
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,960
you must have a punch

1977
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,880
Economic Development and Environmental Protection

1978
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,720
can only be a fold

1979
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,960
Then we must have a society to compare

1980
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,600
develop a more reasonable

1981
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,880
a process acceptable to all

1982
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,320
to form such a policy

1983
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:47,400
But we all know now

1984
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,480
One is a more partisan

1985
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:53,200
Not able to have a rational dialogue

1986
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:55,360
Okay, here's what I'm going to say

1987
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,720
I originally talked about the problem of the colonial regime

1988
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,080
this is us

1989
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,760
In the mainstream discourse of this society

1990
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,940
nativism

1991
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,740
is to be a bit

1992
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,240
we can say is a

1993
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:09,940
Taiwan's New Nationalism

1994
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:12,240
to build an independent country

1995
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,540
It turned out to be anti-KMT

1996
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,480
what about now

1997
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,720
Just break the rules and be anti-China

1998
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,860
this gets in our way

1999
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:27,660
to build a

2000
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:30,260
Lack of incentives to drive economic development

2001
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,560
difficult to construct

2002
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,560
Viable vision of economic development

2003
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,160
at the same time

2004
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,100
Now the KMT

2005
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,400
there is no discussion

2006
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,600
There is no way to be sure of your own history

2007
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,040
no way to position myself

2008
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,440
There is no way to find a new motivation

2009
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:52,380
I was talking about this

2010
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:54,440
It was said during the colonial regime

2011
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,820
that is

2012
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,380
i was talking about this

2013
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,880
by

2014
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,640
Inherited the Chinese nationalism of the old Wang Tucheng

2015
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:08,840
In the process of promoting Taiwan's early economic development

2016
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,640
I just explained

2017
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,440
such a nationalism

2018
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,240
Let them have a clear vision

2019
01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:20,440
That vision is to industrialize Taiwan

2020
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:23,840
i just said

2021
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,080
To complete the establishment of Taiwan as soon as possible

2022
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,040
The great cause of modern industrial production system

2023
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:33,280
so they have a clear vision

2024
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,280
This vision goes hand in hand with saying

2025
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:38,280
We want to foster our own industry

2026
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,280
own business

2027
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,280
We want to learn from foreign capital

2028
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,280
We have to learn from Europe and the United States

2029
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:47,280
but we also need to protect

2030
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,280
protection complete

2031
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,280
Protection is limited

2032
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,280
but we are open

2033
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,280
but there is a process

2034
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:56,280
so you have means and ends

2035
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,280
Then why do you need protection?

2036
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,520
wait a minute because of foreign capital

2037
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Let me grow up and I will open again

2038
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
so

2039
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,000
So your democracy has a clear effect

2040
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
you are the advanced threat

2041
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
wait at the door

2042
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I grow up and I open up again

2043
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
So this is the role of economic democracy

2044
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
You face advanced foreign forces

2045
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Then you want to develop your strength

2046
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
but

2047
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
but now

2048
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:40,000
The mainstream discourse that we have developed in the process of democratization

2049
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
First with the Kuomintang as the enemy

2050
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Said it was a colonial regime, a foreign regime

2051
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
So it is an approach to social augmentation

2052
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
now what i want to say is

2053
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
The economic power of mainland China is not higher than that of Taiwan

2054
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And it has not yet entered Taiwan

2055
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
So in an economic sense

2056
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
speak up

2057
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:05,000
did not infringe Taiwan's interests

2058
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:07,500
That

2059
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,800
So one like this

2060
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,800
New nationalism targets anti-China

2061
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,800
There is no way to help us build a

2062
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,000
A Vision for Future Economic Development

2063
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,700
ok so i think

2064
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,700
just cut off the past history

2065
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,700
difficult to understand the past

2066
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,700
don't know how we got here

2067
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,700
We must go back to the thread of history

2068
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,700
redefine

2069
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,700
For all the people in Taiwan as one

2070
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:44,200
economic community

2071
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,700
How do we define our interests

2072
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,700
Then seek to build a shared vision

2073
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:52,700
the middle

2074
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,700
one we have to face

2075
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:55,700
the problem is that

2076
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,700
How to face in this process

2077
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,700
Taiwan's relationship with mainland China

2078
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,500
It doesn't matter

2079
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,500
that part

2080
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,500
this part

2081
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,500
i must say

2082
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,000
our current thinking

2083
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,500
The ideas in the mainstream discourse of this society

2084
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,500
With Taiwan's early national government

2085
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,500
The pro-American and anti-communist discourses are highly similar to

2086
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,500
That's what I just said

2087
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,500
that is to say we

2088
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,500
In the course of this discussion

2089
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,500
because

2090
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:28,500
the national government

2091
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:32,500
After being a colonial and foreign regime

2092
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:37,000
Our role with respect to the United States and Japan

2093
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,500
There is no way to review positively

2094
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:43,500
So our position for ourselves

2095
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,500
In fact, there is no way to review it positively.

2096
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I am

2097
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,500
I'm over time

2098
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,500
Then I mainly think

2099
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,000
if we do these things

2100
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,500
will help us

2101
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
start again

2102
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
help us go

2103
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,500
It is more reasonable to face cross-strait relations

2104
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:09,500
If we don't face it with this attitude

2105
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:13,500
If you look at history and understand these relationships from history

2106
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:17,000
It's hard for us to find our way

2107
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
ok then i will stop here

2108
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,500
Thank you Professor Ji Wang for reinterpreting the development of Taiwan's modeling economy

2109
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Is there any problem with the rest of the time?

2110
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
We can probably accommodate three or five questions

2111
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
come please

2112
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,000
In fact, I think this speech started from the Republic of China

2113
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Here

2114
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I found from your paper that there are two main axes

2115
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
one is national

2116
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Or the Republic of China we are talking about now

2117
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
introduce myself

2118
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,120
When I talk about the whole context, it sounds like

2119
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:06,800
From the Republic of China to Taiwan in 1945

2120
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,040
But the final conclusion is that

2121
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:13,600
Find the bottleneck of development from the history

2122
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,720
It actually sounds like the bottleneck is still there.

2123
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:19,800
Where is the bottleneck?

2124
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,840
That is to say at the end

2125
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,200
You said this KMT KMT

2126
01:41:25,200 --> 01:41:27,160
it doesn't affirm itself

2127
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,720
In fact, it has always been very sure of its status

2128
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,040
That is to say it ignores a thing

2129
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:34,920
because it's from 1945 until now

2130
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:39,120
it does not readjust to a new social situation

2131
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,640
Actually it is not without certainty

2132
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:41,880
100 years since its founding

2133
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:43,320
Including the Republic of China you are using now

2134
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,680
This is all affirmation of itself

2135
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,440
That is, is it not retuned

2136
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,000
Forty years of development

2137
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:55,200
I'm still going to escape from that old stalk

2138
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,720
It's like saying what you just said

2139
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,880
Canan Ogun of this Hatta raincoat

2140
01:41:58,880 --> 01:41:59,920
that's not a

2141
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,580
that's not a term that everyone is familiar with

2142
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:07,680
But that is to say, later we slowly discovered from this memory

2143
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,520
Hatta Rain

2144
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:11,020
That is naturally related to the so-called Shimen Reservoir

2145
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:16,400
I think it's a fact that everyone knows

2146
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:17,280
The second is to say

2147
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,220
talking about

2148
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:24,060
Does capitalism have to be managed locally?

2149
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:25,600
I think this is a

2150
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:27,400
For example, for example

2151
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,500
Japan has completed from 1895 to 1945

2152
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,060
Three-quarters of Taiwan's so-called railways

2153
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:37,640
Then KMT probably only played a quarter

2154
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,200
But he spent 20 or 30 years playing

2155
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:40,960
I think

2156
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,000
Now

2157
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,300
Does capitalism follow local management?

2158
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,840
ask this so-called

2159
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,880
A group of elites emerged after the war

2160
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,920
Actually they are

2161
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:50,960
not on the ground

2162
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,260
Might be someone from the provinces running this thing

2163
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:54,540
so i was thinking

2164
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,820
The things received are not only Taiwan Bank, Taiwan Sugar, and Taiwan Railway

2165
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:59,860
Anyway, many things were operated at that time

2166
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,300
One question I want to explore is that

2167
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:05,580
when we are in this understanding

2168
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:07,940
Or split it into two articles

2169
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:10,420
National Japanese Occupation period

2170
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:12,540
Also, the identification between us is obvious

2171
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:15,620
We are in this serious speech

2172
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:20,220
We've got a so-called non-consensus position

2173
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:21,820
I'm also talking briefly

2174
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:24,320
If it's not clear, we'll talk later, thank you

2175
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:28,920
but i thank you for your opinion

2176
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:32,000
But I don't understand what your problem is

2177
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,200
my question is that

2178
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:42,240
modern capitalism

2179
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:45,320
You just said he must be operating locally

2180
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:49,400
For example, during the Japanese occupation period, many of his consortiums were from Japanese consortiums.

2181
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:52,480
right so that no longer does not constitute the so-called

2182
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:56,320
During the Japanese occupation period, it has entered a modern national system

2183
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:00,160
Or it has already entered the capital system. Then, during the Japanese occupation period, there were many American

2184
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,200
The situation may be such an example of the Taiwanese operating distance

2185
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,400
the things you just said at the beginning

2186
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:09,220
I'm starting from here is to say

2187
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,300
Hong Kong is also run by Hong Kong people

2188
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:15,100
But he is completely reborn as a Lord of the East

2189
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:16,900
My point is this

2190
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,560
I'm good, let me take a look at what you mean

2191
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,600
That is to say, capitalism should not be localized

2192
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:29,180
the answer is yes

2193
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:31,980
you have to develop

2194
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,080
your own industry your own business

2195
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,380
Hon Hai

2196
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:41,720
He is an industry in Taiwan, and after he developed it, he

2197
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,000
Other current continents

2198
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:46,080
employ nearly 800,000 people

2199
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:49,920
But his company headquarters and R&D are still located in Taiwan

2200
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,240
so

2201
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,600
So the mainland will still detect it as a Taiwanese company

2202
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,300
I answered your question like this

2203
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:06,200
That is to say, if we the Red Sea

2204
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:08,300
If there is no development of the Red Sea

2205
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:11,300
Waiting for Taiwan, for example, processing and exporting

2206
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,900
After the foreign capital left

2207
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:16,300
There are no companies in Taiwan

2208
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,500
But we have developed high technology

2209
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:22,700
Then although the Red Sea moved a lot of production outside

2210
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,300
but it still leaves a lot

2211
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:27,800
So in Taiwan's high-tech industry

2212
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,500
still have a certain size

2213
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:31,900
So I guess this is

2214
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:35,700
It is the localized development of capitalism

2215
01:45:35,700 --> 01:45:40,100
I don't know if this answers your question

2216
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:42,100
ok who else

2217
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,300
please

2218
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:46,000
ask the professor

2219
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,200
Our Taiwan technology is in the world

2220
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:53,000
is a very important part of the exhibition

2221
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,800
Please tell me next time we are in Taiwan

2222
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,000
Can be used internationally like our technology

2223
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
what kind of business would it be thank you

2224
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
the answer is not easy

2225
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I have a look

2226
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Our development in the last ten years

2227
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
that does

2228
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I think it's more worrying

2229
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
That is to say, for our high-tech

2230
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
growing since

2231
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
For example, the past ten years

2232
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
If we look at manufacturing

2233
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
its distribution ratio

2234
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
the whole broad

2235
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
share of the high-tech industry

2236
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
has reached nearly half

2237
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
other industries

2238
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Manufacturing is in decline

2239
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
not that their share

2240
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Decreasing high-tech industry is increasing

2241
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
never happened before this

2242
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
In the past, there were real and some minus

2243
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Taiwan is at least

2244
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,200
Is it a comparison, or a relatively balanced one, one time

2245
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,360
an economy but in the last ten years

2246
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:15,200
Our dependence on high technology is high to a very high level

2247
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,440
but if you say it again

2248
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,720
So you said there's not much room for growth

2249
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,320
i didn't say that

2250
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,600
because this means this

2251
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:30,480
It is also an opportunity for Taiwan to have such development.

2252
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,920
also lucky

2253
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,640
That is, because the high-tech industry is a

2254
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:39,120
In a growing global

2255
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,640
Because Taiwan can participate in this

2256
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,720
this whole world

2257
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:46,000
just how to say

2258
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,160
it's still going on

2259
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:50,480
is the frontier of the world

2260
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:51,800
cutting edge

2261
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,480
He is still pushing forward

2262
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:55,240
Then Taiwan can also participate

2263
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,680
Then this piece is constantly expanding

2264
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:00,040
So Taiwan is lucky

2265
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,240
able to continue to participate in this

2266
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:05,360
Although it is said that profits continue to become microblogging

2267
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:09,280
But this production also has a lot of external shifts

2268
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,300
but

2269
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:15,240
But Taiwan can continue to participate in this industry

2270
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,540
It's our grades and luck

2271
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:21,640
Then I think it has a wiki feel

2272
01:48:21,640 --> 01:48:24,240
but not to say

2273
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:27,040
It is also difficult for us to say that this ratio is too high.

2274
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,120
won't grow anymore

2275
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:28,880
is not what it means

2276
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:29,920
high tech industry

2277
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,880
will continue to grow

2278
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:35,120
that just means

2279
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,920
we go over this

2280
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:39,080
The policy approach to combating fear is to say

2281
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:41,720
Well, then our twenty years later

2282
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,680
where are the growth industries

2283
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,840
this batch

2284
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:50,080
This group of old people said they would keep asking such questions

2285
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,120
That

2286
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:55,180
But this space where the world grows

2287
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,040
That is, I am not just talking about Taiwan

2288
01:48:57,040 --> 01:48:59,520
the whole world

2289
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,800
as far as we mortals can see

2290
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:06,400
seems to grow limited

2291
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:09,400
For example, countries in the world that want to develop

2292
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:15,200
have invested a lot of resources in the biotechnology industry

2293
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:18,500
Just like our Academia Sinica also invested a lot of resources

2294
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:21,800
But the biotech industry

2295
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,700
On the one hand you can say that you also have to vote

2296
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:26,000
because of global competition

2297
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,800
you can't be absent

2298
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:31,300
But the biotech industry is a

2299
01:49:31,300 --> 01:49:33,800
impossible to play such an important role

2300
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,000
i must say

2301
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,900
because of his employment

2302
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:41,700
His employment density is so low

2303
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,500
It is impossible for him to go to the mainland like Hon Hai

2304
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,800
Care for 800,000 people

2305
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,400
Then go and say it's going to reach a million people

2306
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:52,500
Although this means that many of his workers will commit suicide

2307
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,800
but anyway

2308
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:58,200
He has provided such a large amount of employment

2309
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:59,900
The biotech industry is impossible

2310
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:07,000
No matter how it grows, it cannot have such a function

2311
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:13,000
So I think for the biotech industry we have to understand

2312
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
As if there is no way we can't miss out on global competition

2313
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,000
But we can't be based on such a big backward look

2314
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Because of its employment volume, the value it generates is limited

2315
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
and is assuming that you can develop

2316
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Then there is another one in Taiwan. Is there one that can be said?

2317
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Comparable to yours with this technology

2318
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
The kind of business that can grow again

2319
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I don't think we are quite

2320
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
we can't say

2321
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
but i think there are some

2322
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
as far as Taiwan

2323
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,000
But there are industries that have the ability to follow

2324
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,000
For example, what is possible

2325
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
What future industry is the United States developing?

2326
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Taiwan has the opportunity to participate and follow up

2327
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I think this part is that we can actually have this ability

2328
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:26,000
But I think our biggest challenge is

2329
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Can we be more active in business

2330
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Use the mainland market with the mainland

2331
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:43,000
What kind of cooperative development should we do at a relatively high level?

2332
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
For example, Taiwan's high-tech manufacturers have their status

2333
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Although the mainland government is very courageous

2334
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
But with its courage, there is no way to support high-tech members

2335
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,500
Of course you can see that there are all kinds of possibilities

2336
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:10,000
So far, Taiwanese businessmen have gone to the mainland alone

2337
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
able to develop very limited

2338
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,000
But fields like this

2339
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,500
we see some possibilities

2340
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:27,000
But this must be a high level of difficulty

2341
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:36,000
What kind of binocular strategy will be developed by the senior level with social support

2342
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
thank you teacher

2343
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
That one is my personal forward advice

2344
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
what we just talked about

2345
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Taiwan's 60-person economy

2346
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Of course, the Kuomintang has a lot of technical officials.

2347
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
and very talented

2348
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
But Taiwan's CNC is simply

2349
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I think it provides a lot of motivation

2350
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,600
The one who came out of the mountain in 1948 was the 37th year of Mongolia

2351
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:09,400
So from this world in the process of my study

2352
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:14,000
After an official full from us tell us what the 375 checkout is

2353
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,400
And the Kuomintang beautifies the tigers very much

2354
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:20,000
I heard Wen Mao Mao is the landlord

2355
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
My dad is a mother

2356
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
So the mother may benefit as well.

2357
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
But the landlord is God's beloved

2358
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Mother

2359
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:35,000
So when the Kuomintang detected 375

2360
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
He said this private land

2361
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
In less than a year, he immediately included four Taiwan dollars in a box

2362
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:46,000
So Yuan Guo said what he said is the history of our past dynasties.

2363
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Centralize the country's resources to redistribute

2364
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
But I've concentrated a lot of motivation during this time

2365
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
But from our official 375 checkout beautification

2366
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I have visited Ma Guoshidu Taiwan several times for examination materials.

2367
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,560
Come to the country, the Democratic Party can do it when they go back

2368
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:08,900
In addition, for this three-dimensional, if you can do a kind of data research on it

2369
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:13,640
What kind of benefits does this provide to Taiwan, and what kind of cloth number does it offset?

2370
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:19,640
So becoming Taiwan is until now every election, I still regard this as a hype topic

2371
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:24,640
It is also the differences in the policy consciousness of the people in the north and south of Taiwan

2372
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:30,740
So I think we should have the manpower to study him and announce this

2373
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:34,140
Because I think he made the boar view too glorified

2374
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:42,040
Because I want to get first-hand information about this influence from the public security side, from the public security side.

2375
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:45,040
That's a big gap with Gongying's information.

2376
01:54:45,040 --> 01:54:47,040
And Dongying's information is very vague

2377
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,540
Just like Ou Ba, Hideo has never been sad

2378
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:51,540
Thanks

2379
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:58,740
Thank you, I think this land reform depends on whether you want to ask the landlord or the electric farmer

2380
01:54:58,740 --> 01:55:00,740
the answer will be very good

2381
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
both sides for me

2382
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Is the answer different?

2383
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I'm not saying now that I'm going to hold him accountable

2384
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Are you announcing this fact?

2385
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
because of his

2386
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
well i can only answer briefly

2387
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
My first answer is that I think

2388
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
because that is a very clear

2389
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,000
how to say clearly

2390
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Violation of private property rights

2391
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
go with the power of the country

2392
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
move to private property rights

2393
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
The first is to pick up rent

2394
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
The second is to expropriate land

2395
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:43,000
and then distributed to electric farmers

2396
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
so i thought

2397
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Of course he violated the interests of the landlord

2398
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
right

2399
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:55,000
So it's a strange thing that a landowner would approve of that.

2400
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
So the landlords borrow Taiwan dollars when they come

2401
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Electric farmers pay different regulatory NT dollars

2402
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,840
cut this picture back

2403
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,600
no no no

2404
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:08,900
At that time, the three-seven-five cutting beads were changing

2405
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:12,840
The first phase of Sanqiwu Jianzhu was in 1949

2406
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:16,880
was changing at that time

2407
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:19,140
In terms of Taiwan dollars New Taiwan dollars

2408
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:22,180
He is 11 months less than a year

2409
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:25,280
It seems that in less than a year, there will be no NT dollars

2410
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:26,260
New Taiwan dollar same year

2411
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:29,520
1949 Two Things Doing Together

2412
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:34,020
From the first phase to 1949, the first phase to making three seven five cut beads

2413
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:36,460
then in summer

2414
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:37,860
I forgot which month

2415
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:38,720
seems like november

2416
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,500
Is there still something like that Linma in it?

2417
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,840
This NTD is in the Danhua rules

2418
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:45,800
well, the details we can't talk about here

2419
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:47,740
but i think that is

2420
01:56:47,740 --> 01:56:49,800
Let me tell you about his effect

2421
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:51,580
His very important effect is

2422
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:56,080
He forced an end to landownership by coercive force

2423
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,380
Because landlord economy means

2424
01:56:58,380 --> 01:56:59,640
social elite

2425
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
not saying good or bad

2426
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Because China has been like this for thousands of years

2427
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
That is, it is a traditional landlord economy

2428
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
This is the landlord world

2429
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
This official is your imperial examination to become an official

2430
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
This is a Chinese system

2431
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
but you i just said

2432
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
It's CO's bourgeois revolution

2433
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
It just took hundreds of years

2434
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
The feudal is the feudal aristocracy

2435
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
and this land of the Church

2436
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
and the privilege exited

2437
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Then began a capitalist economy

2438
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
the land reform

2439
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
It is also a top-down

2440
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
bourgeois revolution

2441
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
so it ended the landlord economy

2442
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
It means that the elites of society can no longer rely on

2443
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
This landlord is very good

2444
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I'll go, I'll buy land if I have money

2445
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
then landowner

2446
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,400
as a means of livelihood for the elite of this society

2447
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:06,920
This is the past landlord

2448
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,520
the past economy

2449
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:10,000
Our traditional agricultural economy

2450
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:12,280
The Economy of China's Agricultural Society

2451
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,200
the existing model

2452
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,360
we can't say

2453
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:16,160
he must

2454
01:58:16,840 --> 01:58:18,800
call it morally bad

2455
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,280
i think it's historical

2456
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:21,760
glasses of history

2457
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:25,960
but you are under pressure from the west

2458
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:26,600
you

2459
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:29,240
Everybody thinks we have to industrialize

2460
01:58:29,240 --> 01:58:30,720
we have to get into a

2461
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:32,720
this different era

2462
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,520
that this

2463
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,480
What the national government did

2464
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:37,680
the land reform

2465
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:38,680
has an effect

2466
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:40,360
Regardless of the process will definitely

2467
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:41,360
Will

2468
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:43,680
The interests of the landlord must be damaged

2469
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:47,120
big small

2470
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:48,600
Of course there are varying degrees

2471
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:49,800
must be damaged

2472
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:50,760
But Diannong

2473
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:52,760
Of course some electric farmers benefit

2474
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,800
that this

2475
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,320
but more importantly

2476
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,840
it is an era

2477
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,040
changes in the times

2478
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
It forces the economy of Taiwan into a different era

2479
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
At the same time, the national government is also under greater pressure

2480
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Because the elite of your society can no longer live as landlords

2481
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
you have to give them a way out

2482
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
you must industrialize

2483
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
You must develop industry and commerce

2484
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
and let these people have a way out

2485
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
So this is the meaning of his words age

2486
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
In this process, of course, there are gains and losses.

2487
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
no more questions

2488
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Thanks

2489
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Hello Professor, I have two questions

2490
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:36,000
The first one is the Taiwan Miracle mentioned at the beginning

2491
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
including political miracles and economic miracles

2492
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
That kind of statement is Taiwan's economic development

2493
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
democratization of politics with facilitation

2494
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
May I ask if such a statement is established?

2495
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Can it be established?

2496
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
This is the first question

2497
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
The second question is mentioned in the introduction

2498
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
professor you are right now

2499
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
That is, the situation after the reform and opening up in contemporary China has been studied

2500
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Assuming this statement is true

2501
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,640
Can we have such optimistic expectations for contemporary China?

2502
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:04,860
because of economic development

2503
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:07,760
So will politics be more democratic or something like that?

2504
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:08,640
this is the second question

2505
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:09,440
Thanks

2506
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,440
ok very important question

2507
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:16,200
I think all backward countries

2508
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,320
when he started

2509
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:19,520
His politics must be rights protection

2510
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:22,680
is that it should be a common phenomenon

2511
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,400
there is no reason

2512
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:26,400
he is not an activist

2513
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,120
that economic development

2514
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:33,680
He will surely educate many

2515
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:36,760
Get a lot of independent economic resources

2516
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:39,000
Then the economy develops better

2517
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,280
The more individuals with independent economic resources

2518
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:44,760
Everyone's education level has improved

2519
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,280
improved living standards

2520
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,640
So the economy grows

2521
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:52,000
they want to get involved in politics

2522
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,120
the right to participate in politics

2523
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:57,400
desire will be higher

2524
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,960
So the better your economy develops

2525
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,960
It is the desire of some people and the existing political

2526
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:08,700
The higher the tension in the rights-defending political system will be

2527
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:10,960
so

2528
02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:13,660
but

2529
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:17,000
but what happens between

2530
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,500
That is to say it is not a necessity

2531
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:19,760
What I just said is inevitable

2532
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:22,500
That is to say, the tension between

2533
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:26,000
pressure on the existing political system

2534
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,100
The pressure to change will be stronger

2535
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,460
but

2536
02:01:30,460 --> 02:01:32,200
But there is no necessity in this

2537
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,600
say it will

2538
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,400
what must happen

2539
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:36,500
for example

2540
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:42,160
Taiwan and South Korea are relatively successful examples

2541
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,140
That

2542
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:45,600
For example, we see that Thailand A does not seem to be so

2543
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:48,000
relatively less successful

2544
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,900
that we can

2545
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:51,360
But Taiwan and South Korea

2546
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,960
also have different paths

2547
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:54,300
right

2548
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,840
so i guess there is something inevitable

2549
02:01:56,840 --> 02:01:59,100
I just think what I just said is a kind of necessity

2550
02:01:59,100 --> 02:02:00,000
economic development

2551
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,300
The better it is, the greater the pressure on the existing authoritarian system

2552
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:06,060
But how will this road go

2553
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:11,960
Depends on the existing conditions in each place

2554
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:17,160
So it's hard to say it's going to be one way or the other

2555
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:21,600
But we can say that the more average your original development

2556
02:02:22,360 --> 02:02:24,500
more evenly distributed income

2557
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:27,460
Then the allocation of resources is more fair

2558
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:32,120
This democratization process should be better

2559
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:38,420
but I think there are many different factors

2560
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:41,520
For example, if you spend two minutes talking

2561
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:43,420
That is to say Taiwan

2562
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:45,820
We have taken a more convenient path

2563
02:02:45,820 --> 02:02:49,360
we can just say yes

2564
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:53,420
a subject-based

2565
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:56,980
agree with the political path

2566
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,380
This is also because the national government, in its authoritarian way,

2567
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:04,940
I just said

2568
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:08,140
The development of the economy in this military way

2569
02:03:08,140 --> 02:03:11,100
So the issue of that distribution is in Taiwan

2570
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:13,740
hard to be a dominant

2571
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:17,500
to mobilize the people

2572
02:03:17,500 --> 02:03:20,240
This income distribution is too unfair

2573
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:20,940
or how

2574
02:03:20,940 --> 02:03:21,740
this kind of issue

2575
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:23,340
Assigned issues because

2576
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:24,940
under authoritarian rule

2577
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:27,140
He has more or less dealt with

2578
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:28,940
Therefore the issues of these assignments

2579
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:30,680
not easily provoked

2580
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:34,800
to rally these forces of democratic opposition

2581
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,880
But the politics of identity

2582
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:39,880
It's easy to distinguish you from me

2583
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:44,240
is an easier path

2584
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:46,880
So Taiwan has taken such a path

2585
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:47,780
has its benefits

2586
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:49,400
has its downsides

2587
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:50,400
south korean words

2588
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:53,680
He's a very solid mobilizer

2589
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,480
it's him

2590
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:55,980
His most critical is 1987

2591
02:03:56,020 --> 02:03:58,080
millions of students

2592
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,940
union what church

2593
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,900
Going to the street to have a bloody confrontation with the military and police

2594
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:06,140
that is a decisive

2595
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:10,000
Then they were in the post-war student movement

2596
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,400
they have very guild sports

2597
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,080
has his long-term foundation

2598
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:15,440
so you meet boy friends

2599
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:16,640
they are very proud

2600
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:22,440
their civil society is very powerful

2601
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:23,940
For example, like I met a friend

2602
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:27,340
He has a real NGO

2603
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:32,340
They are supported by membership associations

2604
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:37,340
Then there are 100 dedicated staff

2605
02:04:37,340 --> 02:04:38,680
So-called NGOs in Taiwan

2606
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:43,340
I also know that there are full-time professionals with more than 100

2607
02:04:43,340 --> 02:04:46,340
But they all rely on the government's position to report

2608
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:47,840
we don't have that strength

2609
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,180
our so-called civil society

2610
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:51,680
no such basis

2611
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:52,740
but the boy has

2612
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:54,040
that's different

2613
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:57,040
so

2614
02:04:57,040 --> 02:04:59,540
but they paid a high price

2615
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:00,040
like i agree

2616
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:05,000
He said that your apartment is on the street

2617
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
or what rights take to the streets

2618
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Then I went back home for dinner

2619
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
He said we went to the streets when we were young

2620
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
It's just that everyone's head is bleeding

2621
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Go back to dorms

2622
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
if you can go back

2623
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
So they pay different prices

2624
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,000
that's what you paid for

2625
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
the foundation of your civil society

2626
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
it might be different

2627
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
so i feel all the things

2628
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
all have something to say

2629
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
So Taiwan South Korea

2630
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:39,000
we are very very

2631
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,000
country of brothers

2632
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
postwar development of all

2633
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
very very similar

2634
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
But we see this democratic path

2635
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
not exactly the same

2636
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Mainland China really dare not say

2637
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
But I think that structure

2638
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
we have now seen

2639
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
His developmental anger is very good

2640
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
very stressful

2641
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
with the existing system

2642
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
But China is really big

2643
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I can't go on anymore

2644
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
our time is up

2645
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
We thank Professor Ju Wangwen with applause

2646
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Thanks

2647
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Thank you for half a year

2648
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Thanks
