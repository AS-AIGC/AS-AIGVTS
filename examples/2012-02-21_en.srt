00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Can invite us to Taiwan

11

The Great Patriarch of the Healthcare Industry

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Director Qiu Wenda Qiu

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Come tell us about his 25 years

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
research done on neurotrauma

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Director Qiu Wenda in the United States

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
University of Pizza Earns Ph.D.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Also at Nihon University's School of Medicine

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
PhD in Neurology

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then he was at Taipei Medical University

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
served many important

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Administrative portfolio includes Director of Neurosurgery

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Head of Department of Public Health

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Director of the Injury Prevention Institute

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Taipei Medical University

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Vice President of Hospital

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then the vice-principal and the principal

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,940
Director Qiu is also a professor of Doctoral Program in Neurological Disorders

28
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,820
and the director of the Center of Excellence in Clinical Research

29
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,000
everybody knows

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,880
The Department of Health's job is not a good job to do

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,800
But Director Qiu was recruited by the government in 2011

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,200
As the Director of the Department of Health, it has been quite smooth so far

33
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,280
Compared with the previous directors, they have done a good job

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,640
and we thank him

35
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,280
Our health depends on his protection

36
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,960
In addition to doing some academic administrative work, Director Qiu

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,920
He is also in academic research

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,480
A well-known leading scholar in neurotrauma research at home and abroad

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,040
He once served as the chairman of four important medical associations in China

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,000
Society of Surgeons and Neurosurgery

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,720
Neurotrauma and Injury Prevention

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,680
These are the presidents and directors of the largest medical associations in China.

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,320
that's not easy

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,400
He has also served as the president of three international associations

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,140
and Secretary General of the Neurotrauma Committee of the World Association of Neurosurgery

46
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,680
And participated in the editing of five international journals

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,680
And he is also a new publisher of an international journal

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,320
So everyone knows this one

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,820
Qiu Shuchang is actually very careful in taking care of patients

50
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,760
Caring for patients and giving them a lot of love

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,960
Also doing quite well in academic research

52
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,320
And more outstanding in academic administration

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,720
So we have a scholar like this

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,760
to serve as Director of the Department of Health

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,820
It is the blessing of our people, really

56
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,960
I have also known Qiu Shuchang for many years

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,660
I also admire his academic achievements.

58
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,800
Qiu Shuchang made a great contribution to Taiwan

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,840
We say you only need to save one life

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,240
you can go to heaven

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,980
Qiu Shuchang not only saved one life

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,140
He killed more than 3,000 people a year

63
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,740
so he's going to heaven now

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,900
This, Director Zhuo, has been independent all his life in the legislation that motor vehicles are grinders with helmets

65
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,040
Everyone knows that accidents were the third leading cause of death in Taiwan

66
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,860
That's quite a lot of deaths

67
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,000
Then every time we see a very young person

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,840
Sudden injury from a motor vehicle, then brain trauma and death

69
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,000
The family is having a hard time and then his siblings are having a hard time

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But the best way to prevent this is to wear this helmet

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
As for Director Zhuo, it is actually not easy to promote this activity.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Need to have good academic research results

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And you have to be very determined to join the so-called social movement

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Appeal to everyone in the so-called society to pay attention to

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Moreover, legislation is required to promote the promotion of this hard hat

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
able to move smoothly

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After Director Zhuo promoted the legislation of such hard hats?

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
In fact, the accident

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Injuries have dropped from the third to the sixth cause of death

80
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,040
3,000 fewer deaths per year

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,960
This contributes greatly to the health of our people

82
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,960
that in the field of traumatic brain injury research

83
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Our academic journal

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
It also ranks third in the world

85
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
So it's quite an achievement

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Of course you can imagine

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Director Qiu must have won many, many awards

88
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
It's very long if we practice it all

89
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
I only read a few

90
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Including the Individual Special Contribution Award of the 17th Medical Dedication Award

91
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Hua Mingning's Medical Contribution Award

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,960
There is also the Legacy of the University of Pittsburgh in the United States

93
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Lolriot Winners

94
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,960
and this Contribution Research Award from the Asia Pacific Alliance for Public Health

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
more than ten awards

96
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,960
So we can invite Director Qiu today

97
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
come give us a speech

98
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
It's an honor for all of us

99
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
then we

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
welcome with warm applause

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,840
Director Qiu came to give us a speech today

102
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,980
Thanks

103
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,280
Thanks

104
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Thank you Vice President Chen

105
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,360
introduce

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,520
Then thank you for the opportunity to come here to share with you this time.

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
So

108
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,560
I think this 25 years in fact I

109
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,160
graduate

110
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
up to now

111
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,320
37, 38 years

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,640
So what have you been doing for the past ten years?

113
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,200
I'll probably tell you

114
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,160
Then the past ten years have been in

115
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,560
Managing patients with traumatic brain injuries

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
or a brain tumor or something these patients

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,120
Most of them are doing surgery. What?

118
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,680
So

119
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
I haven't

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,680
When I entered prevention, I mostly did clinical work.

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,720
clinical work is like this

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,800
then for example

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,480
Let's talk about car accidents

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,600
then in

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Usually we used to be very early

126
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
in the 1980s

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,900
The students were involved in car accidents at about five o'clock in the afternoon

128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,900
Five point trauma or six point trauma

129
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,300
then sent to a small hospital

130
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,800
Small hospital is sending

131
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,700
It's dangerous to see this

132
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,900
send it to the big hospital

133
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,200
The big hospital got there around seven or eight o'clock

134
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Then start the treatment or start the examination

135
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
check check fiddle

136
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,700
after finishing

137
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,900
just start again

138
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
Tell the patient again

139
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,500
to be operated on

140
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Then watch the patient operate

141
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,000
Because many patients have no family members

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,500
often without family

143
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,900
and very young

144
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,400
At that time, most of them were people in their twenties.

145
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,300
no family

146
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
Otherwise, when family members come

147
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,300
almost eleven o'clock

148
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,500
so we start the operation

149
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,700
almost twelve o'clock

150
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,200
after eleven o'clock

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,900
Every day is almost five days a week

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
open till dawn

153
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,760
often open till dawn

154
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,440
Then I often sleep in the car

155
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
fall down

156
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,480
Then go to the clinic again

157
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,980
life like this

158
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
then

159
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,980
I always think so

160
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,760
one day i sat there

161
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,160
when waking up in the car

162
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,380
Hey, this is too much

163
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,880
too many accidents

164
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,420
Do you want to find a way to go

165
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,520
Do you want to come

166
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,080
do something

167
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,460
take precautions

168
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,620
just thought of saying

169
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,920
Hey, very few people wear hard hats

170
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
At that time, less than 5% of people wore hard hats

171
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,420
I just want to say that I should make a hard hat.

172
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
So this is the previous story

173
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,420
It's all about cutting

174
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
that's there

175
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,920
before the lecture

176
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I'll talk to you guys first because I'm watching today

177
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
I thought it was all like

178
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,420
There are many scholars like Professor Chen

179
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
So I use English today

180
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
present but

181
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,920
There are a lot of pictures, it doesn't matter

182
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,420
I speak Chinese

183
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,820
then let me tell you first

184
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,020
what does a brain injury look like

185
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,020
why is it called tofu

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,300
Brain is almost the same as tofu

187
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,600
Its hardness is not much different

188
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,000
It's just that it has an extra layer of membrane package

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,400
arachnoid pack

190
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
So it's fixed form

191
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,500
And then it has a lot of blood vessels

192
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,200
blood vessels many blood vessels

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
probably so

194
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Its hardness is about the same

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,800
It's similar to tofu, which is firmer tofu.

196
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,200
So this brain hit the ground

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,600
it's broken cracked

198
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,800
But I can't sew, I can't sew

199
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
So it's broken it's broken

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,900
it a lot of people after brain injury

201
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,100
it got recovery just what

202
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,700
Just a reward function

203
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,200
Is to use other areas to reward

204
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,100
So the brain is broken and never recovers.

205
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,700
what about this brain

206
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,800
What happens when we get hurt

207
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,300
The first one will produce

208
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,500
Our mildest is called a concussion

209
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,800
Everyone, maybe most people think that

210
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,100
Wow, a serious concussion

211
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,900
Concussion, actually concussion is

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
One day his bones are like this

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
But just faint

214
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,500
you don't hold up anymore

215
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
But the brain

216
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
No structural damage seen

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Structural damage cannot be seen

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is called a concussion

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
in our general

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He was unconscious for less than five minutes.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
very slight

222
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Well, if you have a brain contusion, it's more serious.

223
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,000
brain contusion is what can see

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I owe even

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
bruising phenomenon

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
it's called a brain contusion

227
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,000
constitutional brain

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
brain contusion

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The coma will last longer

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,500
That's an injury

231
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,000
But the worst thing is

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
really bad brain trauma

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
episodic hemorrhage

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,500
This is all scary

235
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,000
What about after this episodic hemorrhage?

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
often have this phenomenon

237
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that is

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Brain injury right after the car accident

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
After a while

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
maybe a concussion

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But one of them

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Broken blood vessel

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,960
he bleeds slowly

244
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,840
Patient, you see that kid was fine when he came home.

245
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,100
when i got home i said

246
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,600
I had a fight with my classmates

247
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,500
Or create something for the car

248
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
After returning home

249
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,000
He said he had a headache

250
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,800
want to go to sleep

251
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,700
Well, mom, if you pay attention, it's fine.

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
If you don't pay attention, you will see

253
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
The child suddenly started humming loudly at night

254
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,800
weird kids snoring

255
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,400
because he can't breathe

256
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,600
respiratory tract is not very good

257
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,800
just unconscious

258
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,900
Then there are children

259
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Sent to the hospital for surgery to save him

260
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,600
but

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,200
Many of them may not be saved

262
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,300
if you're not careful at night

263
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,200
so he often

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,200
Sometimes there will be a delay in happening

265
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
He woke up with a concussion first

266
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
But what about when we go back?

267
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,400
Bleeding again or getting bad again

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
or how

269
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,520
So this brain injury is complicated

270
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
then we almost

271
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,520
I also hand it over to you today

272
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,240
five tips

273
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,500
Even a brain injury is important

274
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,800
Tips everyone should know

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
that is

276
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,240
what about the first one

277
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,680
Brain injury, you must pay attention to it

278
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,960
do you have a headache

279
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
getting stronger

280
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,560
or especially getting stronger

281
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,420
The second one started vomiting

282
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,580
We usually have more than two

283
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Occasional vomiting is common in children

284
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
But what if more and more

285
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,420
or more than twice

286
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,420
take it slow and be careful

287
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,660
what about the third one

288
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
See if the consciousness has deteriorated

289
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
It's just that people don't know clearly

290
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,160
so sometimes

291
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,660
Wake him up often

292
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
So the fourth one is

293
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,660
often have to wake him up

294
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,660
every first night

295
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
maybe every hour to wake him up

296
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
wake him up

297
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
or the next day

298
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
maybe gone

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's gone, it's always like this

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What about the last one?

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
if anything

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
what's changed in particular

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Which aspect has changed?

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
or how he will happen

305
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
many complications

306
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
then be careful

307
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's better to go to the doctor quickly

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So generally speaking

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
he has a lot of symptoms

310
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wait a minute and I'll mention a lot of symptoms

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But observation is the most important thing

312
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Especially the changes in his process

313
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So in a brain injured person

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
is very important

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So this brain injury is important

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
intermediate prevention of these

317
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, there's actually one more

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
More importantly, the sequelae

319
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Except you have to save him in the acute stage

320
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What about the sequelae? It's terrible.

321
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What about the aftermath?

322
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What if ordinary people

323
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
he produces a slight

324
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Severe trauma, he must have sequelae

325
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
his finger

326
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
he must have sequelae

327
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
His hands and feet are bad

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
or generate

329
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
Lungs or something

330
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
But what about a mild concussion?

331
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
Recently, more and more sequelae have been found

332
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,600
then probably

333
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,100
you pay attention

334
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,600
If we roughly collected literature from all over the world

335
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Probably at least 30 kinds

336
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,100
30 kinds

337
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,300
Bad from long term memory

338
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,800
headache dizziness various

339
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
probably collected

340
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,100
can't concentrate

341
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,700
tinnitus insomnia blah blah blah

342
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,000
There are about 30 kinds in total

343
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,300
So what about the aftermath?

344
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,700
In fact, it has a lot to do with your rest the last two weeks.

345
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,400
So generally we tell patients

346
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,200
It's just about the first two weeks to rest.

347
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,100
Then this is a comparison

348
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,300
At the same time, some others also found

349
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,500
That is, even if the patient fully recovered

350
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,900
he can't see what the symptoms are like

351
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
but if you

352
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,740
while giving him a test called neurobehavioral

353
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,480
Neurobehavioral tests are now more and more developed

354
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,080
then you will find out

355
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,240
What about him

356
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,240
This is about 30% of people

357
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,740
sometimes weird

358
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,180
What about this weird one?

359
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,480
Only his dearest mother

360
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,740
or his wife

361
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
or a spouse

362
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,580
or what

363
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,380
he knows he's changing

364
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,700
so this

365
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,380
Brain injuries are really complicated

366
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,680
That's because he's like tofu

367
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
So there is no way to recover this tofu

368
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,880
Therefore, it is still necessary to do the function of prevention

369
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:43,180
Then I'll probably put this more basic try first

370
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,880
let me tell you first

371
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,680
And then we start looking at this

372
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,780
why do we do these things

373
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,180
then see the next one

374
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,280
So maybe I'll introduce

375
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,080
What is the significance of setting up this center over there?

376
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,720
Then we will tell you what is called transformation research.

377
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,720
Finally we look at our recent research

378
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,400
future direction

379
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,320
I will talk about transformation research for about 25 minutes

380
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,360
I will talk about the current research below for about 30 minutes

381
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,200
Then the previous research is life-saving for us.

382
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,520
Later, I found out that the sequelae caused by it were too many problems.

383
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,240
So the latter is saving something

384
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,880
functional improvements

385
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,440
Just remembering this and see if it helps

386
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,920
how do i do this

387
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,880
So probably my focus today is to mention the next one

388
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,560
So why do this research

389
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,920
This has just been possible because it is very serious

390
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,440
because it is tofu

391
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
tofu victim

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
After the injury, he has a very serious mortality rate

393
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,000
There are a lot of things like morbidity rate and comorbidities

394
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So it has a very big impact on society and the economy

395
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What about the whole world, what about a year

396
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Approximately 9 million people experience traumatic brain injury

397
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
As for Taiwan, about 100,000 a year

398
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The 100,000 is just to go to the hospital to seek medical treatment

399
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There are only 100,000 people, and there are probably even more people who did not go to the hospital

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Then this may be more than three times

401
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So why in America recently

402
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
attach great importance to this thing

403
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

404
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What about many American soldiers?

405
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
did not die on the battlefield

406
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But after he returned to his hometown, he began to have a lot of sequelae

407
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
memory starts to decline

408
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
then start to have a headache

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,300
dizziness poor balance

410
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,000
Insomnia occurs many times

411
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,740
In fact, some people don't feel that there is any serious injury at all.

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,540
But it's the same when he comes back

413
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:18,700
So these problems have caused the whole world to study this so-called

414
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,500
Brain Trauma Research

415
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,360
In particular, the WHO also has more and more disasters

416
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,740
Therefore, special emphasis is placed on the importance of brain trauma.

417
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,500
next

418
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,860
this is 1987

419
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,160
then we will

420
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,240
Did a simple research and found out that

421
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,280
Taiwan is probably

422
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,880
It's probably the area with the worst traumatic brain injury.

423
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,440
we found this

424
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,500
The most serious patient he than

425
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,300
about twice as much outside

426
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,820
so moderate

427
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,620
Of course we use

428
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,900
Grasco Comasca

429
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,800
This is a two table to measure

430
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,300
3 to 8 points are called severe

431
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
9 to 12 points are called

432
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Moderate

433
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
12 to 15 points are called mild

434
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,300
We found that mild

435
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,800
rarely less

436
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
The whole is more serious

437
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
next

438
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
so

439
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,500
It was the locomotive at that time

440
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,300
In 1987, there were only 7 million locomotives

441
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Now it has reached 14 million

442
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
So

443
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,600
All the vehicles inside this one

444
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,100
all vehicles approximately

445
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
If there were about 10 million vehicles at that time

446
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,100
Of the 10 million vehicles, 7 million are locomotives

447
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,100
so serious

448
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,600
And what?

449
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Few people wear hard hats

450
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,100
so so

451
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Top 10 causes of death at the time

452
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,100
are hurt

453
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
accident injury

454
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,100
So this is very serious in Taiwan

455
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,800
But at that time everyone was used to it

456
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
public security

457
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
A lot of people are like, if we talk about prevention or something

458
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,500
They'll all tell you, ah, there's no way this accident could have been prevented.

459
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,500
But in fact, prevention is the most effective

460
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,500
So at that time, I couldn't find any information.

461
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Because health insurance hasn't started yet, health insurance has just started

462
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,000
Well, so, there were very few preventive strategies at the time.

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So this is Taiwan, why was it serious at that time?

464
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Next I think this is the center of our establishment

465
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Divided into four groups, I won’t talk about this one. The next one

466
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What about so-called translational studies?

467
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Just want scientists, doctors

468
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and many of our research institutes

469
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like the National Institutes of Health and cooperation with NIDA in the United States

470
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
INIH in the United States is the cooperation of the National Institutes of Health

471
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Then our whole study

472
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
Much of this process is carried out together with these institutions.

473
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,540
next

474
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
Then of course you need a lot of equipment

475
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,000
including genes

476
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,040
include this

477
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,840
spectrometer these

478
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,440
tissue bank

479
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,140
What's more special is the functional MRI

480
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,240
Then we just bought one too

481
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,240
the best

482
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,080
the latest in the world

483
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,540
So our function for this memory

484
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,080
also did a lot

485
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,340
Then again it is very important for this

486
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,440
IRB

487
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,340
that is

488
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,540
research ethics

489
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,580
This and this clinical trial center

490
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,900
this is very important

491
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,640
one

492
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Core Facility is our main research

493
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,780
center

494
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,740
next

495
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,780
Then we are at Taipei Medical University

496
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,640
in fact

497
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,840
At that time, many of the schools were doing clinical trials.

498
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
especially in nerve

499
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,680
Medicine, then we have three hospitals running at the same time

500
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,000
of course for this

501
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,520
Ethical review is very strict

502
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Then also through WHO's FIRCAP

503
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,880
These next ones, in fact, we

504
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,760
The other six hospitals in the province have a total of more than 8,700 beds

505
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
have a common doing this

506
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,940
Collaborative Research Understanding

507
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
next

508
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,940
then this is where we are

509
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,980
This is a famous Elsep

510
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
them

511
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,340
Made one called Cyber ​​Sport

512
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,040
Cyber Sport Light

513
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,960
That said, the world's research on traumatic brain injury

514
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,060
it ranks in the end

515
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,660
its publication and its influence

516
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,700
What about our first time in 2007?

517
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,340
enter the seventh place

518
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,860
That person's research is into the fourth place next

519
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,640
By 2009, we had entered the third place

520
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,200
Personally still in third place

521
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
next

522
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,100
So what about 2011?

523
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,580
What about the word brain trauma?

524
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,540
we've already run to the first place

525
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,780
then in this

526
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,340
Personally still third

527
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,440
So the whole research aspect

528
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
Our range is pretty wide

529
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
wait a minute everyone can see

530
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,500
We are working on the four levels of depression

531
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
next

532
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
sorry

533
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
this

534
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,140
The voice is hoarse

535
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,240
wait a minute i tell you why

536
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,140
So what is repression medicine?

537
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Depression medicine was first proposed

538
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,340
This is all copied from the US National Institutes of Health

539
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,640
Depression medicine is of course from

540
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,140
Enter this from Basic Medicine

541
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,840
Use basic medicine to the last

542
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,340
Applying it to humans is depression-reversal medicine

543
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,340
next

544
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,340
Then repression research is repression

545
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,560
Use this underline basis for translational medicine

546
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,760
it's mostly transfer research

547
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,360
That is to say, from a team of scientists

548
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,600
scientist link到 basic science

549
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
clinical research

550
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,440
Then take the result of this base

551
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,920
clinical career

552
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,520
It is used in clinical daily treatment

553
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
This is called transferring some

554
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
that is

555
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,600
For example, experts from animal

556
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,360
Slowly research out a lot of things

557
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,720
reapply this thing to people

558
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,280
This is called transfer

559
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,240
next

560
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,240
So a story in the US Capitol

561
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,480
I also tell you

562
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,760
It's America's national restroom.

563
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,040
Do a lot of basic research

564
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,960
That basic research has been increasing

565
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,240
Then Congress couldn't take it anymore

566
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,000
that is

567
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We don't want to know why

568
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
because why has done too much

569
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
but they need to know

570
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
When can be applied to people

571
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That is to say, you do so much

572
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
dogs, cats, what

573
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Then we don't think it's important

574
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
When can these successful treatments

575
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
use it on people

576
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So at that time

577
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Head of NIH

578
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's called Alius Gehoni

579
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
He invented a tool called Translational

580
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Clinical Science comes out in New England Magazine

581
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
He used from Bench to Best Sight

582
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Bench is basic research to Best Sight to Practice

583
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
What about this idea?

584
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
has been accepted by people all over the world

585
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
so

586
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,340
It will gradually develop into the stage of T1 and T2

587
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,460
Then in 2010 the next one

588
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,960
And developed into T1 to T4

589
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,920
Then this has a greater impact on human beings

590
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,340
Not necessarily from cats and dogs

591
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,300
Even from clinical research

592
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,900
be able to run to the benefit of all mankind

593
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,120
impact in the population

594
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,400
It's the whole population that helps

595
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,000
This is a transfer

596
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,160
So the first transfer stage

597
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,200
From basic to clinical application

598
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,860
What about the second clinic?

599
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,760
turn it into something

600
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,700
called guidance

601
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,300
It is because of a lot of accumulated clinical experience

602
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,600
turn it into a guide

603
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
guideline means

604
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,100
Everyone can follow this line

605
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
do something

606
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,900
For example, the treatment of the external cavity of the head

607
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,460
We accumulate from experience

608
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,400
From all aspects of research

609
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,100
make it a line

610
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,000
The line is then used on people

611
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Apply it to all patients like this, everyone’s treatment methods will be compared

612
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
The quality is relatively high and the standard is relatively high

613
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Then you can use Gynein and Health Practice

614
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Go to this and then apply to other, even another country or something

615
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
This is Health Practice is Gynein

616
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So he divides this into T1 T2 T3

617
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Then Health Practice is based on these applications, and finally it is used on the population

618
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So today I will talk to you from these four directions.

619
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
then the next one

620
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
What about the first one? Let me give you an example from basic medicine to clinical application.

621
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, everyone knows that there is a drug called Propofol

622
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
it will it is an antioxidant Antioxidant

623
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
then it can also

624
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
have this neuroprotective function

625
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
This is already proof on the basis

626
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So what if we apply it to people?

627
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
In fact, this anesthesiology department has always been useful.

628
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So some patients work and some patients don't

629
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
next

630
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Then find out that this is useful

631
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
There is osracial of 2.8

632
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
It's what helped this result

633
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
probably so

634
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We have also published this in the literature

635
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
next

636
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Then in this process

637
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We did about 7

638
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
4 of them compare with results

639
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Then I'll be Gynein soon

640
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Of course you don't need to talk

641
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
More fruitful is to say

642
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
we find on animals

643
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
If you treat a patient with a brain sore

644
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
If you use a monitor

645
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
A catheter can measure the pressure in his brain

646
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Constantly measure brain pressure

647
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
That is, the result of treatment will be much better

648
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,760
If the pressure is high we put some water out

649
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,000
if or with some medicine

650
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,140
This is better for patient outcomes

651
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,780
Then this proves that he has 4.3 times the effect

652
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,620
Is hyperbaric oxygen effective?

653
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,700
high pressure

654
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,980
Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers

655
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,420
So this proves that he works for subpolar patients

656
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,320
But it doesn't help a lot with polarity

657
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,920
Then from this

658
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,320
Another special

659
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,580
In treatment we use a

660
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,920
partial pressure, oxygen partial pressure directly into the brain

661
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,160
Well, recently the whole world has also begun to be popular

662
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,720
What did it turn out to be?

663
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,720
What if you measure the partial pressure directly?

664
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,520
he will turn out well

665
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,720
Then I think these details I will no longer

666
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,000
What about this one, especially for people with lung problems?

667
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
If you have lung problems

668
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,200
you want to put it

669
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,720
Oxygen pressure and oxygen height are more difficult

670
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,500
So however you can get from the machine

671
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,940
Turn it up with a FIO2

672
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This is especially useful for patients, and it is very helpful for patients with trauma

673
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
So these are all evidence of T1, which means we have done

674
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Then if T2 is based on clinical experience, make it Gaili guidelines

675
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Then we made a Taiwan Gaili around 2007

676
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
This is all published in the literature

677
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Then we will establish an Asian Gaili with Japan, South Korea, and China

678
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This is also in Gaili Nero, which is the magazine with the highest score in our neurotrauma

679
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Then this, the next one I'll see...

680
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Then this has been published in this, published in bilingual

681
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Then whatever the book is published

682
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And besides, he's also...

683
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Published in international literature

684
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,580
what about this one i wait

685
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,000
Now all our neurosurgeries use this

686
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,880
doing treatment

687
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,040
everyone has one

688
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
something like a biboy

689
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Of course it's still being updated

690
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,040
maybe wait a minute i brought the basics

691
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,240
then the first few

692
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
I can send you any questions

693
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,540
next

694
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,240
Then we use the British Sign Level of Evidence

695
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
to define him

696
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
evidence

697
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
next

698
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Then

699
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Our recommendation also uses Sign Grade

700
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
next

701
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Then it includes these eight items

702
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
emergency room treatment

703
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Determination of brain pressure

704
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
how to do it

705
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
cerebral perfusion pressure

706
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,240
With this Fruits Therapy

707
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
Then Sedative Nutrition these

708
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
i will watch your brain

709
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
I can

710
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
the second one

711
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
People's treatment of these next

712
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,400
Then this is one of the consensus in Asia

713
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,100
meeting next

714
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
then we are probably here

715
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,160
this meeting this is not a

716
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,900
evidence base it is a consensus

717
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,200
Then we have some consensus on these four themes

718
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
next

719
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,200
So, for example, what do you think, this brain pressure

720
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,200
is a therapeutic concept, not just a tool

721
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Of course this has

722
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,000
My ventricle from the foreign ventricle is the most effective treatment

723
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
What about brain infusion pressure?

724
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,000
He thinks no less than 60

725
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
At the same time, this should not exceed 70

726
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,500
This is an important concept

727
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
next

728
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,500
What about the other one? I think it is

729
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
This is called decompression

730
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Open up the bones of the brain

731
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,000
When the brain is swollen, the pressure can be squeezed out

732
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,500
We think this is also good

733
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
especially in very malignant brain tumors

734
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,400
Here I'm going to talk about a brain

735
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,200
there are a lot of different

736
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,360
This tofu nao is different from tofu

737
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,000
The tofu shattered on the ground

738
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,100
But the brain has many blood vessels

739
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,100
It has an omentum wrapped

740
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,300
After being injured, it will take a while

741
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,600
horribly swollen

742
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,100
sometimes when you cut

743
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
when you turn it on

744
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,200
That brain looks like this, what does it look like?

745
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,400
We're called Dry Bread

746
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,500
It's like dry bread suddenly absorbs water

747
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,100
swell up so fast swell up very fast

748
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,700
This is the same place in the brain

749
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,400
because its blood flow is affected

750
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Its venous return is not working

751
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
swell so fast

752
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,700
So this sometimes this has to do a decompression

753
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,100
Then the other sedatives are also considered to be

754
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,900
Anti-oxidation is helpful for this generation defect rate

755
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,300
next

756
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,300
then in the United States

757
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,000
In 200 years, the United States made a survey

758
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,020
When entering Taiwan

759
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,720
We put America's one guide to the next

760
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
just take it

761
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,900
They believe that hyperventilation, political and economic agents

762
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
These political and economic agents are still useful

763
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,400
None of these hyperventilations help

764
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
next

765
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,900
Let's see if it works locally

766
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,520
We have treated more than 580 patients in Taiwan

767
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,200
Proven brain pressure measurement on the first day

768
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,200
with an average of one to three days

769
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
all meaningful

770
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
next

771
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,200
At the same time, it is meaningless for perfusion pressure

772
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Measuring means nothing

773
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
It is also meaningless for breathing hyperventilation

774
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
next

775
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
So the whole T3

776
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,200
From empirical evidence to Health practice

777
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,200
We have about three larger ones

778
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,200
The first is that we put the American

779
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
It should be used in Taiwan

780
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,740
think there is

781
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,060
Then we did the case ourselves

782
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,060
After you did the case yourself?

783
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,440
now at present

784
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,100
Promoted by Taiwan Society of Neurosurgery

785
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,780
then in addition

786
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,640
Our case in Asia

787
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,720
also did part

788
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Then this year will continue

789
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Then come out one by one

790
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,720
then we'll use it to

791
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,080
Asia

792
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,960
We have the same treatment model

793
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,320
especially for asians

794
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
everyone has

795
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,020
international consensus

796
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,020
Then the treatment of patients will be better

797
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,020
This is what Action should come

798
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,020
next

799
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,520
then there are many more

800
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
for example

801
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,020
we still have to do

802
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,140
this

803
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,340
parenteral nutrition

804
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,940
in 48 hours

805
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,140
What about this patient?

806
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,180
very helpful

807
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,180
next

808
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,680
then in addition

809
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,380
WHO has a table on quality of life

810
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,580
yes to this

811
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,180
quality of life

812
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,020
Measurements are helpful

813
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
next

814
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,020
Um

815
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,520
then compare

816
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
interesting

817
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Of course, this is a health insurance treatment file

818
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
We also found in the health insurance treatment files that

819
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
The treatment file of this health insurance

820
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We found patients with brain injuries

821
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
suddenly this

822
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
skezophrenia is higher

823
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
this may have some

824
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
citation problems

825
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
or the coding on the login

826
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It was the problem of coding at that time

827
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But this is just a reference

828
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The next one is the health insurance treatment file

829
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
This is also in our database

830
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
The health insurance treatment file also found that

831
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
after brain injury

832
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
its this

833
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
generate this

834
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
3 times higher rate of zeitgeist syndrome

835
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
will generate this in the future

836
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
This has been confirmed in many studies

837
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Especially the full phone

838
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Nearly 60 to 70% of the majority have developed geriatric syndrome

839
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It doesn't have to be old age, it's arctimer, Alzheimer's disease

840
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So all over the world, there is a correlation between traumatic brain injury and the age and Alzheimer's

841
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Successive reports have been brought out

842
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The next one, more importantly, this is two studies

843
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
For our future T3 to T4, one is the research of Professor Wang Longde

844
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
He proves that wearing a helmet is better than not wearing a helmet

845
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The result is 2.6 times better than what we did ourselves 2.1 times better

846
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It is similar to international research, the next one

847
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So let's talk about this fourth one, we call it T4

848
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
From this Health practice to Health in

849
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
impact in population

850
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Here we are from 25 years

851
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
have been building a lot of databases

852
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
These four databases are relatively large

853
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
just have this

854
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
There are more than 180,000 cases used in epidemiology

855
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The clinical database has more than 2000 cases

856
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
There are more than 1,400 cases of data registration of clinical water collection and provincial merchants

857
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And here is the org library

858
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
About nearly 20,000 Samples

859
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
This is Huadong's situation

860
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
next

861
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't need to talk about this

862
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
This is the org library

863
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
This is what we discovered at the time

864
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There are differences between Taipei and Hualien

865
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The incidence rate in Hualien is about

866
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
388 is twice that of Taipei

867
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,400
The death rate in Hualien is four times that of Taipei.

868
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
And he has a higher ratio of truck to cargo

869
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,400
next

870
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,800
We also found that the counties and cities in the east and outlying islands

871
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,400
Where the ratio of their locomotives is relatively high

872
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,800
Their mortality rate and incidence rate are high

873
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
next

874
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,800
Then we were also in 1993 and 1997

875
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,000
Almost all the hospitals in the country have done

876
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,800
Then it can be concluded that this is dead 230

877
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,800
About 230 people per 100,000 people

878
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,700
About 70% are caused by vehicles

879
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,300
That's a very high proportion in the world

880
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,700
Then this was also published in the American Journal of Public Health

881
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,600
next

882
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
so the whole process

883
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,900
The most important thing for us is to promote the protection process

884
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,600
So I did a lot of research

885
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,500
There is a way to push this

886
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,000
this

887
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,740
Hard hat legislation

888
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,040
then the next one

889
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,020
Of course, a lot of international comparisons have also been made.

890
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,280
use it to cite the next

891
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,160
Then this is the picture we often use

892
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,140
Tell me all, let's see if you smile when you wear the hard hat this time

893
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:22,500
This time it's in Portuguese, and I don't understand it either.

894
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,460
it's a case a case

895
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:38,640
This is so funny I don't even have to talk

896
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,640
Everyone knows that the helmet is very funny

897
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,380
so we are in taipei

898
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,400
At that time in Taipei, in Taipei in 1984

899
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,360
Just push hard hats, not without legislation

900
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,320
At that time it was to fetch land

901
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,460
Later, I found out that during these four months

902
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,120
in four months

903
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,700
More than 500 people were mobilized by Taipei City Traffic Continental

904
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,580
Crack down everywhere without wearing a hard hat

905
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,000
But soon you find out that

906
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,080
The number of hospitalized patients has decreased by 30%

907
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,220
Death rate reduced by 56%

908
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,620
was very surprised

909
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,580
suddenly so much less

910
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,840
At the time, people thought it couldn't be prevented.

911
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,880
It turned out that the wards were all empty.

912
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,140
A third of the wards are empty

913
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,680
So of course I was scolded by the MP

914
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,220
There is no legal basis for saying this, just ban it casually

915
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,920
They don't dare to catch it anymore

916
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,920
then later

917
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
next

918
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,160
so in

919
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,600
Through the middle process I would have had many times

920
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,100
I took it all off

921
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,660
this is a lot of process

922
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,120
Sometimes there's a parade, there's a Campan

923
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
do everything

924
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,500
even at public hearings

925
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,500
in the legislature

926
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
Very hard

927
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,500
after more than three years

928
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,000
Finally in 1997

929
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Passed on June 1, 1986

930
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
next

931
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,500
This is before the legislation

932
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,000
You see this man is very smart

933
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
full of wisdom

934
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
next

935
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
This person is also good

936
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
He's the only one here

937
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,500
next

938
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,000
At that time began to ban

939
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
one day

940
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
More than 10,000 slippery eggs

941
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
the whole country

942
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
next

943
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
you see it's been a few days

944
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
become like this

945
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,500
next

946
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,000
This can still be legal

947
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
when i speak abroad

948
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I talked about this

949
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
i thought it was a joke

950
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Then someone really got up and asked me

951
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,500
how do you promote

952
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,000
animal hard hat

953
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
i can't tell

954
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
next

955
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
this is in Taichung

956
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
2021

957
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
look at this

958
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
it's over 100%

959
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Then you see so much of this one

960
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I only see a hard hat that looks like a fake

961
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So this effect is pretty good

962
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
then let's see how it turns out

963
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
next

964
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
you see usually start here

965
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
this is taipei

966
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
It turned out to be at 7300

967
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
7500

968
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
7200

969
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
around 7400

970
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Then the motor vehicle accident injury

971
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
just keep falling

972
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Fall here and leave around 4300

973
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
4300

974
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Recently dropped to around 3600

975
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
More recent what CBL

976
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
everything is coming

977
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
so

978
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
The final proof is

979
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
it helps

980
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
some people asked me

981
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Is that because the number of cars is decreasing?

982
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
my next one

983
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
No car has been increasing

984
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Now it has reached 14 million

985
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Increased by 82% over the past 10 years

986
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Then the population also increases

987
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,740
11% increase

988
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,740
Admission increased by 10.5%

989
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,940
But the death rate dropped by 51%

990
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,940
next

991
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,980
This is very important to our public health

992
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,480
potential loss of life

993
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,680
Very helpful especially for this young person

994
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,680
so i believe

995
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,180
not only saved a lot of people

996
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,180
but saved the young man

997
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,680
this is more important

998
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,180
next

999
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,660
You can see that we have been

1000
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,660
This is nearly 30 years

1001
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,660
Both are the third of the top ten babies

1002
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,660
suddenly in that year

1003
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,660
dropped to fourth place

1004
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:41,660
fifth place

1005
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:42,660
sixth place

1006
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,660
Hope to catch up with diabetes to the seventh place soon

1007
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,660
next

1008
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,660
This is where we put the whole

1009
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:51,660
last july

1010
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,660
rewrite the whole

1011
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,660
you can see this

1012
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,660
This is the case with increased locomotive maneuvers

1013
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,660
next

1014
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
In front, T1 to T4 are all doing life-saving.

1015
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I will talk about some functional issues later

1016
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Since then, almost all researches have focused on functional

1017
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Efforts to improve these functions

1018
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I might speak faster

1019
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Because this place is still full of deep

1020
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
next

1021
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So what is this called a concussion?

1022
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
or mild traumatic brain injury

1023
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
That is to say, the unconscious time should not exceed 30 minutes.

1024
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
This is the definition of the US Department of Defense

1025
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The same goes for its altered consciousness

1026
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
no more than 20 hours

1027
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Then there is memory loss within 24 hours

1028
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
while scores are 13 to 15

1029
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
The most important one is

1030
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Mild traumatic brain injury is a CT scan

1031
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
are all

1032
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,600
can't see things can't see hurt

1033
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,960
But although I can't see the damage

1034
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,600
It still has sequelae, let me tell you

1035
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,600
next

1036
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,740
Why does everyone attach so much importance to this

1037
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,240
Mild The S just now means serious

1038
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,480
M means mild

1039
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,560
He said

1040
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,080
Nearly 20% of the soldiers

1041
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,080
sent to iraq afghanistan

1042
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,320
After coming back, they still have this symptom 20%

1043
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,700
What about in the Marine Corps?

1044
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,760
This is somewhere in Afghanistan

1045
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,480
92% of his injuries are not likely to be brain injuries.

1046
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,120
Then what

1047
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,480
This armed vehicle

1048
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,580
there's no way or no way to

1049
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,880
This blast wave especially

1050
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,520
low low frequency wave

1051
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,960
damage to the brain

1052
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,640
So it is very simple to say

1053
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,300
if you are a soldier

1054
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,500
there's an explosion nearby

1055
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,700
you have never been hurt before

1056
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,100
But 60% of people still have this

1057
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,400
mild brain injury

1058
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,600
What if there were more than four times before?

1059
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,600
100% will have this symptom

1060
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,000
Symptoms come out

1061
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,400
so this

1062
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,100
Go back to the American soldier

1063
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,100
very serious

1064
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,500
So he asked several countries

1065
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,900
Let's do it together and see what he said too

1066
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,100
Which country has done the most research

1067
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,700
So we also join in this study

1068
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,800
So for this mild brain trauma

1069
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,200
In fact we also have many

1070
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,700
We're just different types of injuries

1071
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,200
But also very mild

1072
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,100
Many have never seen a doctor at all.

1073
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,300
But he has many symptoms

1074
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,500
next

1075
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,600
i forgot or forgot to tell this

1076
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,100
why is the voice hoarse

1077
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,300
right no

1078
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,800
not me mild brain trauma

1079
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,100
because I was

1080
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
pushing hard hat

1081
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I remember that time

1082
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
The Director of Nursing is

1083
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yu Yumei Professor Yu

1084
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And Lai Meishu, Professor Lai

1085
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
two are government

1086
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
He arranged a lot of speeches for me

1087
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
what to talk about

1088
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Kaohsiung Taichung Countryside

1089
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Talk about everything Three Gorges

1090
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
There are hundreds of games

1091
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
He just wants to push this hard hat

1092
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I was a scholar at that time

1093
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Scholar's speech is enough

1094
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
talk now no one will listen

1095
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
This official is useless

1096
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
nothing works

1097
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
was a scholar

1098
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
So academics I talk about hard hats all day long

1099
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
it's important very important

1100
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I always take that

1101
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
a preserved egg tofu

1102
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Then put it on the ground and show them

1103
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Broken in a plastic bag

1104
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's how it was done back then

1105
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Preserved egg tofu

1106
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So talk every day for a long time

1107
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Afterwards, the voice killed the teeth

1108
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
can't come back

1109
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
As long as there are too many lectures in the course, it will start to kill the itch

1110
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This is the sequelae

1111
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
not a brain injury

1112
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The main symptom is anemia red disorder

1113
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Look at this MTBI poor red disorder

1114
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Because of Nell's connection to the cerebellar concussion.

1115
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
headache hearing loss tinnitus

1116
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
or cognitive impairment

1117
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So far there is no good treatment

1118
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
nothing good so far

1119
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
next

1120
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So this is four countries in the world

1121
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Israel is also a country that often explodes

1122
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Motor vehicle accidents in Taiwan

1123
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
famous a lot serious

1124
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Sweden is one that is equal to less

1125
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
it is the least harmed country in the world

1126
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So they are more like a country-by-country study

1127
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,500
All directions, I will pass quickly, the next one

1128
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,560
The diagnostic tool next

1129
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,600
Of course this patient must have

1130
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,360
Inclusion and exclusion mean

1131
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,020
Which ones can be in it? Others can’t. The next one

1132
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:19,420
Then this is the basic information, about 190 or so

1133
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,940
Because of this why the charge is less

1134
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,140
Because of this the first patient has to agree to the second

1135
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,000
Once he does these tests

1136
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's all harmless

1137
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,700
It's just a questionnaire, what an hour?

1138
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,500
Everyone will still avoid it

1139
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:40,000
But some because doing it helps him

1140
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
so he will participate

1141
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,300
the next one

1142
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,300
Then you can see why this happened

1143
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,300
About 50% of car accidents now

1144
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,500
Others are falls or injuries

1145
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,500
next

1146
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,000
Then we used 14 tables

1147
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,500
This is all countries in the world

1148
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Four countries synchronized

1149
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,400
Doing this four, it's four tables

1150
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
The next one, I don't mention this

1151
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,400
What are the main symptoms we see

1152
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,400
These are just the thirty types I just mentioned

1153
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,400
Of the ten, the most common is dizziness

1154
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Dizziness, dizziness after a mild injury

1155
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,900
headache, sleep disturbance

1156
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,400
Now more and more data prove that

1157
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Sleep disturbance linked to brain injury

1158
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
mildly cause

1159
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,500
memory impairment

1160
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,500
And I can't concentrate

1161
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
These five are the most common

1162
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,500
This is the first accused stage

1163
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,500
When impromptu, the next

1164
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,500
After six stars, you are following it

1165
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
or headache, the most common

1166
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,500
Dizziness, now it's a headache, just dizziness

1167
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
Then memory impairment, turn it up a bit

1168
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,600
then follow this

1169
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
can't concentrate

1170
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,600
and

1171
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,120
sleep disorder

1172
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
next

1173
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,800
Then let's see what if it's dizzy?

1174
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,000
There are a few forms I think this one I'll make soon

1175
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,760
Avaka scale, Dhi, Y, Bd scale

1176
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,620
These are all able to detect this

1177
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,840
Dissidence is dizziness

1178
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,320
Headache is one

1179
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,400
Anxious VAI scale helps

1180
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,400
next

1181
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,480
What about sleep disorders?

1182
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,040
This VAI BDI

1183
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,080
Here are some tables of depression

1184
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,080
Also the Digitspan of this memory

1185
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,400
These few are related to the next one

1186
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,920
What about memory? These two

1187
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,080
DHI and Digitspan

1188
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,240
these two

1189
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,240
So now many scales can be measured

1190
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,120
some very mild symptoms

1191
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,680
This is what several of our countries are doing together.

1192
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,040
Then I also took these medicines at the same time

1193
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,600
Here are some medicines

1194
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,040
Well, we're almost in sync and venting too

1195
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,400
The previous medicine helped with dizziness

1196
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,600
Topamax was originally an antiepileptic drug

1197
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,960
Helpful for this depression

1198
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,000
Serenna is helpful to designus

1199
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,560
So take it slow

1200
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,240
Because there was no special medicine on the mild head part

1201
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,160
everyone has been looking for

1202
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,720
Find out if there is any medicine that can help these symptoms

1203
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,560
especially long-term symptoms

1204
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,080
next

1205
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:37,280
The second is to use the functional

1206
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,280
Resonance scan

1207
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,680
functional MRI to test memory

1208
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,280
this is also very important

1209
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,640
next

1210
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,920
For example, this is called

1211
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,800
is walking memory

1212
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,080
It's you who saw these faces

1213
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,800
which one have you seen

1214
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,000
just think about it

1215
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
seen this

1216
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,200
He will test you again when you are using your brain

1217
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,840
Test your activity

1218
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,380
next

1219
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,440
Then this is one back

1220
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,840
Just look at a number and then look at it for the first time

1221
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,440
Whichever ones you have seen, you can point them out

1222
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,480
After seeing this, press your hand

1223
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,800
Then you are called walk in memory

1224
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,440
one back

1225
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
two back is

1226
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,720
I have to remember more

1227
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,080
How did you compare to last time?

1228
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,040
three back is

1229
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,040
How much do you remember from the last time

1230
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,680
wow he's about to think

1231
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,080
Think about this kind of one back two back three back

1232
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,720
next

1233
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,160
then you can see

1234
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,160
one back normal

1235
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,760
two back three back

1236
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,320
he uses more brainpower

1237
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,120
But this wounded person

1238
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,120
he is bad

1239
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,200
he's all bad

1240
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,520
poor memory

1241
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,480
next

1242
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,160
then you too

1243
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,600
if you cut it off

1244
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,080
You can see the wounded people almost

1245
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,840
When it comes to two back three back

1246
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,760
he can't use anything

1247
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,000
next

1248
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,500
Then this is after progress

1249
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,500
this is the initial stage

1250
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,000
When I was first injured

1251
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,800
you can see this

1252
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,500
2BG reduced to 1BG

1253
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,500
Or 3BG reduced to 2BG

1254
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,000
are relatively poor

1255
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
but

1256
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
about 6 weeks later

1257
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
You can see it's coming back a lot

1258
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
next

1259
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So

1260
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,500
This is called Rest in state

1261
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,000
functional MRI

1262
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,500
this one has to close the eyes

1263
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,500
can't think about anything

1264
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,000
This is pretty difficult

1265
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
and then can't fall asleep

1266
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It's also very complicated to do this

1267
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,500
It's been a long time

1268
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,500
next

1269
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,000
all the world does is see

1270
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
what is this looking at

1271
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
connectivity

1272
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
In fact, the mind of the brain

1273
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
are all interrelated

1274
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It's all interconnected

1275
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,500
There are about 8 places in the world that do it

1276
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,000
I won't mention this

1277
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
next

1278
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
We did about these 4 places

1279
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
next

1280
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,020
You can see this is normal

1281
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:07,020
Both sides are pretty good. Connectivity is not bad.

1282
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:11,020
Connectivity of two brains after injury

1283
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,020
Activity Connectivity is bad

1284
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,020
next

1285
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,020
this is the same

1286
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,020
Another place with AC

1287
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,020
This will get worse

1288
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,020
next

1289
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
This IPL is getting worse

1290
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,020
this is getting worse

1291
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,020
next

1292
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,020
This IPC has also become worse.

1293
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,020
next

1294
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:36,020
So the whole thing looks like this is pretty obvious for

1295
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,020
functional connectivity

1296
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,020
All in Resident State Network

1297
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,020
It's obviously getting worse

1298
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,020
next

1299
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,020
that's all we want to say

1300
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,020
took a lot of medicine

1301
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,020
Some help some not necessarily

1302
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,020
Most recent from 2008

1303
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,020
I am reporting by the way

1304
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,020
It's Felici

1305
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,020
Report a rather shocking statement that

1306
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,440
For this use this TTCS

1307
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,880
TTCS

1308
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,720
So how about stimulating the brain?

1309
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,720
Find out about this R-CIMER

1310
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,840
Or is there a

1311
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,880
Motor neuritis can help

1312
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,080
then this doesn't hurt

1313
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,400
no harm so far

1314
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,080
So we also made a few

1315
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,920
next

1316
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,280
see if it helps

1317
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,920
Just after the injury

1318
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,520
You'll see it compared with

1319
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,080
scattered

1320
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,520
This activity suddenly dissipates

1321
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,000
It seems to be better after finishing

1322
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,800
next

1323
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,520
this is the same

1324
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,720
This patient is obviously

1325
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,040
Sometimes his memory improves

1326
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,880
But this one hasn't

1327
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,080
very mature

1328
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,120
just everyone now

1329
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,760
Only started coming out after 2008

1330
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,280
just use normal

1331
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,160
very light

1332
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,880
very small stimulus

1333
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,760
next

1334
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,400
next

1335
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,520
I won't mention this

1336
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,160
then in addition

1337
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,720
the third is

1338
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,240
What I want to tell you is

1339
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,220
It is very simple called BioMarker

1340
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,000
BioMarker is

1341
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,400
after you get hurt

1342
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,360
There must be a component in the blood or spinal cord that will try out

1343
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,560
will rise

1344
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,200
Then we are looking for the most ideal BioMarker

1345
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,760
What is called BioMarker?

1346
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,880
This biomarker is now the world's

1347
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,840
This Vice President Chen is in prison

1348
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,840
But it's more complicated in the brain

1349
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,160
especially after traumatic brain injury

1350
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:38,800
next

1351
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:40,840
then we are looking for

1352
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,680
This must be the most ideal BioMarker

1353
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,160
must be easy to get

1354
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,280
As far as the patient is concerned, don't suffer too much

1355
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,280
Put a tube in your head to get it

1356
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,280
it doesn't make sense

1357
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,000
So normal blood can be seen

1358
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,440
then it has diagnostic value

1359
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,160
It is also helpful for the queen

1360
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,440
From BioMarker you can see that

1361
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,040
what will happen to this patient

1362
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,760
hope so

1363
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,480
Will the memory come back?

1364
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,600
what will happen

1365
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,480
Will motor function return?

1366
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,040
Then there is a therapeutic effect

1367
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,560
this is very important

1368
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,280
the most important thing

1369
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,000
it can follow its severity

1370
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,360
or the progression of its time

1371
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,120
can show its composition

1372
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,600
say it's progressing

1373
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,560
We saw that Marker come down

1374
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,400
I knew what would happen to this patient

1375
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,040
next

1376
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,920
So we have a clinical pathway

1377
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,640
Decision Tree

1378
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,640
Decision Tree means

1379
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,920
My wine room has a slight

1380
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,560
10% serious

1381
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,200
Then some cut and some don't

1382
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,840
The last 95% live

1383
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,240
1% of these living people are vegetative

1384
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,760
4% are severely disabled

1385
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,240
7%

1386
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,080
then 80%

1387
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,120
3% recovery

1388
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,600
what about this

1389
01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:05,940
Let's look at his cognitive function at the end

1390
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,660
psychological function

1391
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,540
or physiological functions, etc.

1392
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,360
What about from this process?

1393
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,040
We can use BioMarker to analyze him

1394
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,040
next

1395
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,640
This is what we are doing now

1396
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,860
We report a lot of BioMarkers all over the world

1397
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,280
that this

1398
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,240
We are more commonly used is S100B

1399
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,520
GFAP's NSE and Apple E

1400
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,920
next

1401
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,440
so recently

1402
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,120
we found a

1403
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,920
ETK

1404
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,080
I don’t think I need to talk about this ETK anymore

1405
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,480
then this

1406
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,080
right

1407
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,200
A lot of what we want is met

1408
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,400
next

1409
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,360
I don't think I need the next one

1410
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,560
for example

1411
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,640
he can control

1412
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,280
injured on the right

1413
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,280
that will make it stronger

1414
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,480
Gao Qiang on the right hand

1415
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,240
Then Impact 2

1416
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,020
Heavier damage is deeper

1417
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,720
this is the same

1418
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,700
it can be divided left and right

1419
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,700
next

1420
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:12,680
even it can

1421
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,460
It knows both weight and strength

1422
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,700
Same as this S100 X10

1423
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,600
Of course there is one, but it's not so clear

1424
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,320
also a little

1425
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,400
then even in

1426
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,500
When Impact is heavy

1427
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
When the strength is greater

1428
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,500
it is heavier

1429
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,500
Then look at its timing, timing

1430
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,500
time this is GFAP

1431
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,940
This is Acting

1432
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,680
then look at this

1433
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,340
One hour Three hours Six hours One day Ten days

1434
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,340
Then what

1435
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,780
When the brain swelling starts to disappear

1436
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,780
it just falls

1437
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:50,780
so for this time

1438
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,180
Timing Severity

1439
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,780
help in every way

1440
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:55,780
next

1441
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,220
so what do we think

1442
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,820
this may be a

1443
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,180
Effective BioMarker

1444
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,960
It this Rapid Change

1445
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,940
There are T-Shows Organization Specific

1446
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,140
have a diagnosis

1447
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,100
In addition

1448
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,540
it can know the severity

1449
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,060
And Time Course

1450
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,060
and easy to get

1451
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:18,040
So maybe a Candidate BioMarker

1452
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,440
TBI

1453
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,060
This is the direction we are trying to find

1454
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,900
next

1455
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:24,940
So

1456
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,140
new drug development

1457
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:29,300
Of course, the development of this new drug has nothing to do with BioMarker

1458
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:30,740
very relevant

1459
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,580
With the BioMarker just mentioned

1460
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,740
next

1461
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:36,440
Then this is our cooperation with Academia Sinica

1462
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,740
us

1463
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,380
This one from Beijing Medical University

1464
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,940
School of Pharmacy cooperates with Academia Sinica

1465
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,640
Scream comes out a lot

1466
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,200
Red are neuroprotective drugs

1467
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,900
Then we chose a program called Emo-Dim

1468
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,000
Emo-Dim

1469
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,500
next

1470
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,840
then this is

1471
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,800
This is an emodin

1472
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,640
But a Compound

1473
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,900
next

1474
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,000
Then we start from the first day

1475
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,840
just give him the next one

1476
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,580
You can see that this is the taste of water maize

1477
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,680
A test on the memory of mice

1478
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,200
It can be seen that this is injured and it will become like this

1479
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,860
this is

1480
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,700
I used this emodim and it seems to be helpful

1481
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,780
Of course in the end with

1482
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,500
Even better than this sham

1483
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,900
is to control

1484
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:27,440
You can see in this process

1485
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,680
emodim

1486
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,460
ETK, GFAP, Connecting

1487
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,620
These indicators are very obvious

1488
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,120
lower than the original

1489
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,580
Especially ETK with obvious

1490
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,880
I think this is from days

1491
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,340
fourth day, seventh day

1492
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,140
I think

1493
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,860
It is of course better to look at several indicators at the same time

1494
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,580
This bio mark is better

1495
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,880
But this proves that the medicine

1496
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:57,880
to this

1497
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,200
Then the protection function is there

1498
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,240
So now let's develop BioMarker first

1499
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,920
Then see the effect of this medicine

1500
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,120
This is also a good direction

1501
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,240
next

1502
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,320
So we also think that ETK is

1503
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,440
With this severity is a good BioMarker

1504
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,920
In addition this EmoDIM is

1505
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,440
Helpful for this too

1506
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,640
next

1507
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,600
so probably

1508
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,440
These are the ones we are doing research on

1509
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,000
And we still have a few

1510
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,280
The result hasn't come out yet

1511
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,760
just a few sleep cycles

1512
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,920
Called Sercadium Regen

1513
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,840
There are also some genetic tests

1514
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,360
Genetic testing probably won't make sense to everyone

1515
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,360
But in this gene

1516
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,960
Many of them also affect the prognosis of patients

1517
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,160
this is

1518
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,640
the whole process

1519
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,160
what about the future

1520
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,320
next

1521
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,080
We'll probably all be doing this in the future

1522
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,560
This is what we just saw

1523
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,600
They are all doing life-saving work

1524
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,160
Then the future is us

1525
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,960
it keeps falling

1526
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,240
keep falling

1527
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,280
In the future, it is to improve the function

1528
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,080
At the same time the next one

1529
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,640
then what to do at the same time

1530
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,680
economic benefit

1531
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,520
Then this is Chen

1532
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,040
Vice President Chen

1533
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,860
He hosted a program called BioSignature

1534
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:29,440
The most important thing here is the BioMarkers

1535
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,720
add this

1536
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,260
Cost-effectiveness

1537
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:33,780
If it is possible to put this

1538
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:34,820
fell down

1539
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:37,880
to this

1540
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,940
Finance can also help

1541
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:41,980
To this Cost Effective

1542
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,780
that's even better

1543
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:46,080
what about the future, of course i think about this

1544
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,880
direction is very good

1545
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,640
next

1546
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,680
let's look at this

1547
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,000
whole traumatic brain

1548
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,040
Health insurance data files

1549
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,060
you can see

1550
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,400
Our patients have been decreasing just like what we did just now

1551
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,040
has been decreasing

1552
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,920
But for the next one, his fee will continue to be high

1553
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,300
So this is also the direction we have to work hard

1554
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,300
next

1555
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,360
Then this is also a patient in the outpatient clinic.

1556
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,360
next

1557
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,400
That probably cost us a lot.

1558
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,560
So this is also a heavy burden for the country

1559
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:25,520
Maybe we can specialize in patients with these sequelae

1560
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,100
also have a great influence

1561
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,100
next

1562
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,400
so i think the future

1563
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,300
we will continue to do some

1564
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,800
to this BioSignature

1565
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,600
What I was talking about just now is

1566
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,800
BioMaker plus a study of Cos effective

1567
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,100
Then continuing this will be of greater help to mankind.

1568
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,400
next

1569
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,700
then this is

1570
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,300
This is Chen Yun

1571
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,500
Chen Yun is the team led by Lea Hardware

1572
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:54,300
next

1573
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,300
so

1574
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,400
The whole conclusion is that

1575
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,700
what about our research

1576
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,140
Do it all the way from T1, T2, T3, T4

1577
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:09,540
Finally, we improved the function

1578
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:13,140
In addition to saving lives

1579
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,720
Finally, we still need to improve this function, the next one

1580
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:20,220
We are currently working on many more

1581
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:23,020
This is also a clinical trial

1582
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,100
This is made by a manor

1583
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,500
He uses this in the neurological function of the flying belly

1584
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:31,660
very good on animals

1585
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,100
So this we will study in the future

1586
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Is it helpful to people, the next one

1587
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:41,540
and we will continue

1588
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:45,740
With the US National Institutes of Health

1589
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,380
And some of our institutions in Taiwan

1590
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:51,340
Many institutions have eight topics in progress

1591
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,120
In fact, probably this

1592
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,120
Also are some nerve restoration NUROProtective

1593
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,120
How to do nerve protection

1594
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
next

1595
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
This is what we are grateful to the team

1596
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
There are also various Supporting Agents

1597
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So I guess the whole process goes like this

1598
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
This is a lot

1599
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
a hard hat push

1600
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
In fact, it is supported by many studies

1601
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So research may be a

1602
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
A very important process of a legislation

1603
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
I want to simply report to here

1604
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Thanks

1605
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Thanks

1606
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
We thank the old director

1607
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
give us this wonderful speech

1608
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
What to say from foreign research

1609
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
pushed until legislation

1610
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
and how to make his voice affected

1611
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Then everyone's lifespan can be reduced

1612
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
In fact, you can see

1613
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Now foreign businessmen have to pay gold coins to the government

1614
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
also quite a lot

1615
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,460
I really appreciate the care he has done for the health of our people.

1616
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,160
that now

1617
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,800
After the Soviet Party finished speaking, I don’t know if you have any questions and would like to ask for leave. Please come here.

1618
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,280
I want to thank the Soviet Party today

1619
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,800
give us then

1620
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,800
That's more information

1621
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,960
I want to ask the Soviet Party

1622
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:31,040
The emphasis is on the brain, but you didn’t mention traditional Chinese medicine in your speech just now.

1623
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,200
that of Chinese medicine

1624
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,200
TCM assistance in this regard

1625
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,520
is that

1626
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,060
please that

1627
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,360
Then explain it, okay?

1628
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,200
thanks for that

1629
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,020
TCM we probably

1630
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:48,320
more importantly

1631
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:53,200
From the research of traditional Chinese medicine, the emodin mentioned just now

1632
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,560
So

1633
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:57,760
Of course, the way of Chinese medicine is general

1634
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,800
more acute

1635
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,240
Or in Western medicine more

1636
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,960
We don't have a deep understanding of traditional Chinese medicine.

1637
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:11,280
Generally, we cooperate with traditional Chinese medicine

1638
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,280
all in Chinese medicine

1639
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,960
Aspects of these restorations to memory function

1640
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,040
probably like this

1641
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,320
Ask Director Qiu

1642
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,080
Today I am very convinced to hear the director's lecture

1643
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,040
Because I used to crash

1644
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,040
I mean the motorcycle fell off

1645
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,720
That moment was almost a few seconds

1646
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,560
not at all for a few seconds

1647
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,280
i.e. completely blank

1648
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,840
then wake up

1649
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,440
I just feel my head is so heavy

1650
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,680
At that time, it was very heavy to wear a hard hat.

1651
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,800
that until today

1652
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,520
but at that time

1653
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,320
I don't feel like I didn't go to the hospital

1654
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,080
Then you just mentioned that this has

1655
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,040
just say how much

1656
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,760
After 30%, it will be easier to change the time card

1657
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,540
I've been doing this for almost a few years

1658
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,920
then you pass

1659
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,520
almost ten years

1660
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,760
Cleared

1661
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,480
Will there be sequelae in the future?

1662
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,200
It all happened a year or two later, some will happen again

1663
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,960
But after a while it rarely happens again

1664
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:22,560
rare

1665
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,800
That is to say later

1666
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,520
Is memory affected

1667
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,200
my memory is not very good

1668
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:31,360
but not serious

1669
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,640
That is to say, it is still possible to read

1670
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,960
can still learn

1671
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,320
That is not bad

1672
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,560
you have passed

1673
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,440
It should be passed

1674
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,680
Really will not advance the times in the future

1675
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,640
rare

1676
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:43,800
In our watch rarely happens again

1677
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,440
so

1678
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,440
Some people have more than a year

1679
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,400
Very good

1680
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,200
thank you so much

1681
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,440
Thank you, Mr. Su, thank you

1682
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,800
an intro to me just forgot

1683
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,040
Our Professor Jiang Yongsai

1684
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,280
He is actually the soul of this study

1685
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,000
Then when I go to Su, he is doing it now.

1686
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Thanks

1687
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Lord, you just mentioned

1688
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
about alheimer's disease

1689
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Then this is now the biggest threat to our people

1690
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Now the age of bottle gold has been increasing

1691
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Does your field cover this part?

1692
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
we are surgeons

1693
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Most of that is done by physicians

1694
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
but this

1695
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
his current base

1696
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
more and more clear

1697
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
But still not completely Clear

1698
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
but it is becoming clearer

1699
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Or I just had a lot of it

1700
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
BioMarket has something to do with that

1701
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Maybe Director Jiang has no idea about this

1702
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
What comment does R-Type have?

1703
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Just according to the latest statistics

1704
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
That is to say, to create a

1705
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
The origin of disability

1706
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
old trauma is caused

1707
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
one issued by early tibet

1708
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,760
So basically speaking, the quality that the teacher likes

1709
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,760
better not get hurt

1710
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,000
another one

1711
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,800
In addition to talking about the severity of his injuries

1712
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,800
We are still in the number

1713
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,800
more times

1714
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,000
Of course the brain will be

1715
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
means we bad chance

1716
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,200
In fact, we used to have neurology diseases

1717
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,600
But he suffered from trauma

1718
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,400
Now it is getting more and more attention all over the world

1719
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
but it's normal now

1720
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,200
our this

1721
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,600
The main forest six community industry will encounter this problem

1722
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,200
old age

1723
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,200
all have this phenomenon

1724
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,200
sorry

1725
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,800
After joining

1726
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,800
I just raised my hand and didn't get clicked

1727
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,000
I'm at a community college promoting

1728
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,800
Lin Jingtang, a teacher of memory promotion and prevention, gave a speech

1729
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
i have two questions for the dean

1730
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,800
The first one is that just now we talked about

1731
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,000
during that treatment

1732
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
will do this

1733
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,300
farming or raising

1734
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,400
But from the inside of the antioxidant machine inside Professor Lin Tiansong

1735
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,700
he mentioned a very important thing

1736
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,040
He said that in the process of first aid, especially in the ambulance

1737
01:14:12,540 --> 01:14:15,360
He often gives an injection of that SOD first

1738
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,180
The kind of potion that resists oxidation or polarizes beauty

1739
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:21,000
It means that after the epidemic prevention, his future brain

1740
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,780
even if rescued

1741
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,340
But his cognitive function will be impaired

1742
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:28,680
Because we all need to know that raising the brain is the biggest attack

1743
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:29,700
Because the oxidizer is

1744
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,300
That brain attack is the biggest

1745
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,320
this is the second question

1746
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,140
The second question I have

1747
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,260
During the teaching process, one of the students was also injured by a motorcycle

1748
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:43,060
then he comes

1749
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,640
When he told me about his condition, my master had already

1750
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,720
because of how he is i listen to him

1751
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:53,300
Ask him to explain how he got hurt first

1752
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,100
estimate a little

1753
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,140
You are probably missing the back of your head

1754
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,180
because he has a symptom

1755
01:14:59,180 --> 01:14:59,900
that is

1756
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,060
May have been touched all night

1757
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,400
cortical nerve

1758
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,440
Is there a large area of ​​local fusion or something?

1759
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,940
I don't know

1760
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,360
But he produced a phenomenon

1761
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:13,080
He just creates some mutual

1762
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,240
or Internet

1763
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,440
In other words, I see Su Zhanglin now

1764
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,480
Standing over there is not only one

1765
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,440
maybe three maybe five

1766
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,080
while standing there

1767
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,000
Then he went to the capital department

1768
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,180
each north each

1769
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:26,640
Because we live in Taoyuan

1770
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,840
Hospitals in Taoyuan in the northern regions have seen

1771
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,520
Then the capital division

1772
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,720
The ophthalmologist also went to see the workers are normal

1773
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,320
but can't explain

1774
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,680
It's just that there is no way to treat it.

1775
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,560
I use one I know of called

1776
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,320
Jeffson's Nice Law

1777
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,320
tell him to watch the moon at night

1778
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,120
Then use this method to host

1779
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,080
Let me see if the image can overlap again

1780
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,240
I don't know about that

1781
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,120
This medical base of that brain turns up

1782
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,040
Is there anything I can do to increase my knowledge

1783
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,080
the most important one

1784
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,500
That is, the occupational therapy component

1785
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,800
to this part of the brain

1786
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,500
rarely treated

1787
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,500
I don't know if the Director can help in this regard

1788
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,000
give me some guidance thanks

1789
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:17,500
This abdomen produced by treatment

1790
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,000
usually

1791
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,500
because of some eye movement or

1792
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,500
external nerve injury

1793
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:29,000
or some kind of nerve injury

1794
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,500
that would have a negative impact

1795
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,500
This long time see we long time see

1796
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,000
Another phenomenon is

1797
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
epileptic cancer

1798
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,500
Sadistic epilepsy, it produces hallucinations

1799
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,500
or these

1800
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,500
It's a brain injury long enough to see

1801
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,500
but i didn't see it

1802
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,000
I don't know what this is

1803
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,500
what kind of sobriety

1804
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,300
Then generally this

1805
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,500
Causes can be found in most cases

1806
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,000
Doing a lot of testing can find

1807
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Sometimes even use brainwaves

1808
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
look inside the brain

1809
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Is there any abnormal discharge

1810
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,500
Sometimes this abnormal discharge is

1811
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,000
saw this for a while

1812
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
but sometimes it doesn't

1813
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,500
See if it's straight or long like this

1814
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,000
So if there is a function

1815
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,500
That 346 nerve injury

1816
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,500
that will also

1817
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Also in the brainstem

1818
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,000
Sometimes the brainstem

1819
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,500
We're like at EW Nuclear

1820
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,000
that will also

1821
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,500
That's where our third pair came out

1822
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,000
Like the brainstem or where it comes out

1823
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
where the primitive nucleus

1824
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Injury can also produce this phenomenon

1825
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
So there are quite a few reasons for it

1826
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
But the most important thing is to find out and find a way to treat it.

1827
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,500
Also the second is

1828
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,000
The problem with SODs

1829
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
I'll start with the neurorehabilitation

1830
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,500
This is where Taiwan should work hard

1831
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,000
Because I was 30 or 20 years ago

1832
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,500
probably soon

1833
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,000
I forget my age now

1834
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,500
bad memory

1835
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
When I was in America about 20 years ago

1836
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
i see its rehab center

1837
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Very serious about brain sores

1838
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Wow, all kinds of mental rehabilitation

1839
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Function is neuro psychology

1840
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
rehab rotation center

1841
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I am back in Taiwan and it is strange that our rehab is very simple

1842
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I am not dividing any brain or anything

1843
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
But in that place whether you're in Texas

1844
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
I see this brain rehab center everywhere in Pittsburgh

1845
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And a lot of people inside are once

1846
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Two, three or four people sit inside

1847
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,000
So now there are several big centers in Taiwan

1848
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
have already started, so the rehabilitation of the nerves

1849
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
we really have a lot of room to strengthen

1850
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I want to thank you for specifically reminding this

1851
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
This is very important for Taiwan

1852
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
is this good

1853
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
so you can see it's not tv lately

1854
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
have seen one

1855
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,300
This congressman was shot or what?

1856
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,440
Afterwards, the skin returned to normal

1857
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,240
This is a very good function

1858
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:10,700
or mental rehabilitation

1859
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,300
Mental rehabilitation is doing very well.

1860
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:14,500
there is a way to do this

1861
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,600
I think you are very discerning

1862
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,000
As for this SOD in

1863
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
If you go in, call him

1864
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,800
This is generally not yet

1865
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,200
Inside GiLine

1866
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,500
We said why do GiLine

1867
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,100
the whole world or the whole country

1868
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,400
universally acknowledged fact

1869
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,000
so maybe it helps

1870
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,200
But if it's still in the research stage

1871
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,300
We don't put in GiLine

1872
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:41,400
Do not put in GiLine

1873
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,800
you don't have to do it routinely

1874
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,600
But sometimes you can upgrade

1875
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,000
Whole trial if patient agrees

1876
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,100
Can use

1877
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,000
this i think this is

1878
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,100
The current measures of this

1879
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,000
GiLine not yet

1880
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,600
sorry

1881
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:55,800
Of course the team leader

1882
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,700
The leader compliments me like this

1883
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:58,500
i can't

1884
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,100
I need to change my major a little bit

1885
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,840
don't report

1886
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,300
That is to say, in fact, after ten years in Taiwan,

1887
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,400
The dementia or cognitive impairment

1888
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,040
Even cognitive degeneration affects behavior

1889
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,440
Then this kind of thing that affects the family

1890
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,040
i have dealt with a lot

1891
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,320
So I feel that the future of Taiwan is really scary

1892
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,720
The streets are full of old people who are afraid

1893
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,440
And I don't even know where my home is

1894
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,360
this is too much

1895
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,800
the point is to say

1896
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,440
because in Europe

1897
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,120
Now in Brain Science Education

1898
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,080
not wrong

1899
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,640
This piece of adult education on the education of the brain

1900
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,200
they have put education

1901
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,600
Inclusion of adult education

1902
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,440
A concept of health care

1903
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:40,000
This is the concept of health care

1904
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,920
Force the elderly to study as much as possible

1905
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,120
Prevent brain degeneration from affecting body degeneration

1906
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,640
Then this is hope

1907
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,080
If Mr. Su says there is a chance

1908
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,560
Introduce this concept to our Taiwan

1909
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,640
lest in the next ten years there will be old people crawling everywhere

1910
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:56,000
The second situation is that

1911
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,560
Just now I mentioned this so-called prevention

1912
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,080
The United States is now in

1913
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
There is a building next to the old house

1914
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
There is an old house next to the Jiansheng house

1915
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
they are now in person

1916
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
intimate self

1917
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Already did bad things

1918
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
But our teacher in Taiwan said

1919
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I often participate in private

1920
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Private students learn many activities

1921
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Or Teacher Wang Peiling

1922
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
often have some activities

1923
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
I will send my DM

1924
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
As a result, the students did not show up

1925
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
The idea of ​​brain degeneration

1926
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Hope it might be

1927
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Take a little effort to promote

1928
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
lest it be said that the burden will be heavier

1929
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Caused by degeneration of the brain

1930
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Degeneration of the body thank you

1931
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Thanks

1932
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
As for

1933
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
cerebral

1934
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
rehabilitation for this memory

1935
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I think

1936
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Of course it's not me

1937
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I am professional

1938
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
i thought i would ask more

1939
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
the expert

1940
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
then think again

1941
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
see how to do it in this direction

1942
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Thanks

1943
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Thanks

1944
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,500
Su Chang, I think my question may not have a direct concept with what you just said

1945
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,200
But you're an expert on old founders

1946
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,100
I also want to hear your opinion

1947
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,000
We often see reports abroad

1948
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,700
Some people wake up suddenly after being in a coma for many years

1949
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:20,700
What is the reason for being sober?

1950
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:24,300
The other is that these people, after waking up,

1951
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:27,300
Has his brain function fully recovered?

1952
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,800
Or because a certain part will definitely suffer some damage

1953
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,600
yes thank you

1954
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,800
in my experience

1955
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,500
In fact, quite a few recovered

1956
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,800
Even some hypoxic patients

1957
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,700
Well, after half a year and a year, he's fine again.

1958
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:48,800
But the barriers to function are huge

1959
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,100
Some hands and feet are not good

1960
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:56,500
But some hands and feet are good but he has almost no memory

1961
01:22:56,500 --> 01:23:00,000
Well, it's better. I've seen it too.

1962
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,240
There is a patient who wakes up six months a year

1963
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,120
And there are no obstacles

1964
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:09,140
Of course, I think this is mostly a reward function.

1965
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:11,640
less likely to regenerate

1966
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,980
then this is a

1967
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,860
I'm a photo studio

1968
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:19,620
I have been around for so long, I have only experienced one year and six months

1969
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,560
A child in a photo studio

1970
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:25,280
a couple

1971
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,140
take good care of this kid

1972
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,940
every day is like

1973
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,240
I'll tell a story by the way

1974
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,480
every day is like

1975
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,780
this

1976
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,120
A good man talks to him every day like this

1977
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,120
how about him

1978
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:39,500
take care of him fearlessly

1979
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,380
Every day every two weeks for three weeks

1980
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:44,740
Or look at taking medicine or something like that

1981
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,760
Then I remember he told me

1982
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,620
When he woke up at twenty-four

1983
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:51,240
after waking up

1984
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,840
It's getting better and better in a few days

1985
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,540
he asked him

1986
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:58,080
Back of CAM

1987
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,040
That's the one

1988
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,040
Call that CAM again

1989
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It seems to be from 2008, I will talk about it later

1990
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:11,000
It was expensive when he saw it. At that time, it was tens of thousands of 1.6 million

1991
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
He seems to have about 800,000 yuan left after he wakes up

1992
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
so he told me the story

1993
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
There are not many such examples

1994
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
No symptoms can be seen like recovered skin

1995
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
But most of the time there will be partial recovery of function

1996
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And it will leave some legacy

1997
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I don't know what kind of patients Director Jiang has encountered.

1998
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,000
There are still cases where the patient wakes up for a long time

1999
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Usually people are everywhere

2000
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But after waking up

2001
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
No matter how well his brain functions, it can be explained.

2002
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,000
In fact the whole brain functions like a specialty kyogen

2003
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It means that every member of the troupe must sing well

2004
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
So we're honestly a whole function

2005
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
So when our honestly functioning cells

2006
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
More often it is our husband's chance

2007
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
When missing basically his

2008
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
He may look like you can see through

2009
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
when you give him some tests

2010
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
also found that we can't do it

2011
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
The most common is memory

2012
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
just tell him this

2013
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
had breakfast

2014
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Special finished his lunch with two breakfasts once

2015
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
He can't afford it every season

2016
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I have to remember the memory that exists or give me a season

2017
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
probably like this memory

2018
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
That is to say, his husband can't

2019
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I can't keep up with everything for you

2020
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Thanks

2021
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
now purser sorry

2022
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
because I'm sorry I didn't see you that

2023
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
2007 should come

2024
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
then i was thinking

2025
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
How long is the best time for this patient to arrive at the hospital

2026
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
to be sent to the hospital

2027
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
that future

2028
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
future words

2029
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
i won't please

2030
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Of course it is the biggest job outside of God

2031
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,600
But in the future, can the beef be regenerated?

2032
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,900
Or is there some drug that can regenerate it

2033
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,800
Because the whole thing looks like a neuropathy

2034
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,600
It should be that symptom, probably a beef problem.

2035
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,500
Is there any better medicine?

2036
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,000
at present

2037
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So far there has been no major breakthrough

2038
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,800
Including Stem Cells

2039
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:24,400
someone put it in the brain

2040
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,000
How about it

2041
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,800
haven't had a big breakthrough yet.

2042
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:31,800
But there are constant heart medicine coming out

2043
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,000
That is to help some metabolism

2044
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,800
or how

2045
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,200
But the real regeneration is not so much

2046
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,200
This still has to work hard

2047
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,500
Stem Cell is in the animal seems to have some help

2048
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,100
But if you really use it on people

2049
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,300
not necessarily

2050
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:55,800
This is too complicated

2051
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,600
Environmental factors have too much influence

2052
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Yes, this practice certainly has

2053
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
But everyone always try their best

2054
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Really see regeneration in people

2055
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
not too that

2056
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Thanks

2057
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Yoon-hyun and then sell the two girls, please.

2058
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I would like to ask, that is usually after our limbs are severed

2059
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
If you want to untie it back, what can't you do after your brain is broken?

2060
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Then I want to ask, that is, assuming that our brain

2061
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
That is, a certain part, for example, was cut off

2062
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,000
It's the part of the brain that's been cut off.

2063
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Then what will its original function be?

2064
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
It's the one we were talking about

2065
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Is there any connectivity? This place we sometimes

2066
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
During the operation, the pressure on the brain was too high, the dry breath just mentioned

2067
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
dry mask

2068
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
When you squeeze me out, there is no way to eliminate some of the less important places

2069
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
This karma will also erase it

2070
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Where does it go after disappearing?

2071
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
run to the other side run to other places

2072
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
it comes with a reward

2073
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,000
A lot of the brain's function is to help that person live in other places.

2074
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Just like the choir he mentioned here

2075
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
That white gull token is broken

2076
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
in the end please go on

2077
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Of course, the function is not as good as before

2078
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
But what about this

2079
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
it always brings rewards

2080
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
no way

2081
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
There is no way to connect the Sino-Soviet nerve until now

2082
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
studied for a long time

2083
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
if this can be regenerated

2084
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
become the Norbert winner

2085
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
This problem is the Sino-Soviet nerve

2086
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
it is mainly missing a

2087
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Original Dental Site

2088
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
then what

2089
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
do not know

2090
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
i forgot now

2091
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
probably so far

2092
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
There is no way for the central nervous system

2093
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Regenerate

2094
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
But when he gets around, he can

2095
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
He can regenerate after denervation

2096
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
The question is, the lady in front

2097
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Thanks

2098
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Director thank you for protecting young people

2099
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Afterwards I was just listening to the director strict barrier

2100
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
There are references to the brain

2101
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Part of the biomarker

2102
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
i feel very interested

2103
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
so i want to know say

2104
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Can biomarkers become

2105
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Determining patients with cerebral arterial flow

2106
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
An indicator of the need for surgery

2107
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
good question

2108
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Cerebral arterial flow is like this

2109
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
If cerebral arterial flow is usually

2110
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,400
It doesn't have to be broken before everyone will show symptoms.

2111
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,800
What about some that you are talking about are not broken?

2112
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,500
suddenly discovered

2113
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:15,800
Then probably quite a high percentage have found this

2114
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,600
about a few percent

2115
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,600
one to three or so

2116
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,200
Sometimes this arterial flow is found in routine examinations

2117
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,900
Then do you want to go under the knife?

2118
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:27,700
some smaller

2119
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,500
sometimes or never broken

2120
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,000
or in a more dangerous place

2121
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,300
Sometimes we don't advocate surgery

2122
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:38,000
Well BioMarker has no way of knowing that

2123
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,600
Because generally unless that arterial flow has been pressed to some brain

2124
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:49,000
The brain releases abnormal markers due to injury

2125
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,100
He just needs to go under the knife

2126
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:54,400
Only then did I know if he was under pressure and the pressure was crushed to the brain

2127
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:57,700
If it's very small arterial flow probably not

2128
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:59,200
not easy to find

2129
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,200
that if big

2130
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,200
he can see

2131
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,360
I think

2132
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,440
The development of BioMaker is

2133
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,160
a hope for the future

2134
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,440
so probably

2135
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,160
Many people are looking for this thing now

2136
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,080
See if you can actually do some

2137
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,440
that's like this brigade lake

2138
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,640
average travel lake

2139
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,120
Do you know what arterial flow means?

2140
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,080
arterial flow is not flow

2141
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,080
arterial flow is a

2142
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,000
where the blood vessels cross

2143
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,960
there is a weakness here

2144
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:27,160
it sticks out

2145
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,880
highlight a little

2146
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,000
But at the age of

2147
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,800
it breaks

2148
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,640
Broken brain hemorrhage

2149
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:35,320
can't save

2150
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:36,000
or

2151
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,720
go in and clip it off

2152
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,880
cut it off

2153
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,200
that some arterial flow

2154
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,920
before it broke

2155
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,680
It's on a routine MRI

2156
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,400
Or CT scan found

2157
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,840
that's what we just did

2158
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,320
This is located in the proposed

2159
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,880
made by miss

2160
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,800
Are you going to clamp it off?

2161
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,800
very

2162
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,760
fee this

2163
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:58,120
Dime gold

2164
01:31:58,120 --> 01:32:00,120
This is for clinical use

2165
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,600
Probably Meyermag didn't help on this one

2166
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,500
I'm sorry, may I ask Su Chang

2167
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:12,020
If say after your brain contusion

2168
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,320
after surgery

2169
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,880
A piece of your skull is missing

2170
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,720
Will that affect the whole

2171
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,320
Won't

2172
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,120
Won't

2173
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,320
Will he

2174
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,320
His brain injury is more important

2175
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,320
Brain injury is more important

2176
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:29,520
Will it affect your optic nerve?

2177
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,520
optic nerve

2178
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,520
that depends on the location

2179
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:35,520
If the optic nerve goes this way

2180
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,520
If you are affecting sometimes

2181
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,520
will affect

2182
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,520
some people will affect

2183
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,520
look at the location

2184
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,520
What if it affects the future?

2185
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,520
what will happen

2186
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,520
Okay, let me talk about the bones first.

2187
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:47,520
bone

2188
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,520
bone

2189
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,520
bone defect

2190
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,520
often see

2191
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:54,520
because for the time

2192
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,520
I was talking about the dry bread just now

2193
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,520
squeezed out

2194
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,520
So when you need to save your life

2195
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,520
put the bones

2196
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
let go of the bones

2197
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
put it up

2198
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
that's okay

2199
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
It will collapse badly for patients in the future

2200
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,000
You can even raise a bird here

2201
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
so big

2202
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
but it won't happen

2203
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
will not affect the patient

2204
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
That's progress now

2205
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Now it is even possible to use a computer to defend

2206
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Do this arc and everything well

2207
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
and then put it in

2208
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Dress up exactly like you used to

2209
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Of course it's best if your own bones are the best

2210
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
But now it can be done well

2211
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
so don't worry about this

2212
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
What about your second question?

2213
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
I suddenly can't think

2214
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Will it affect the four nerves?

2215
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,000
maybe a nerve

2216
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Yes, this is the position where you will be injured.

2217
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
facial nerve words

2218
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Sometimes the path of its facial nerve is injured

2219
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
That face is crooked

2220
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Then the four nerve pathways will be crooked if injured.

2221
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
also can't see

2222
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
So it all depends on the location of the injury.

2223
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,000
What if it only affects

2224
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
affected

2225
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,680
For example, let's see why

2226
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,440
The facial nerve because it is not the Sino-Soviet nerve

2227
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:08,780
So some can be used

2228
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,520
but very difficult

2229
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:14,420
The regeneration rate is not necessarily high

2230
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,320
Four nerves are more difficult

2231
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,400
Four nerves if it is because

2232
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:24,280
Fractures compress this to sometimes decompress it from the bone

2233
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,560
it recovers some

2234
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,480
in place of the four nerve tubes

2235
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,920
Often there will be a fracture in this place that presses it

2236
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,760
there is hope for that

2237
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:35,400
But it may not be able to recover much

2238
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,240
here's a question leave

2239
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,120
hello secretary

2240
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,120
I now have a medical

2241
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,600
I want to ask you about the actual case

2242
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,120
OK

2243
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,000
The first is to say

2244
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,360
In October 1999

2245
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,000
that is

2246
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,020
Four knots when driving

2247
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:06,020
One car becomes two or three

2248
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:11,020
Later, I went to take a radiography

2249
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:15,020
Underwater tumors found under the brain

2250
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:22,020
Later, it was surgery with a small Weijing pen gun.

2251
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,020
had surgery

2252
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,020
Hospitalized for about ten days

2253
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:31,040
It's been almost a year and a half now

2254
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,040
Follow up every six months

2255
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:37,040
Now tracking and found another problem is in

2256
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,040
Where the blood vessels grow again

2257
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:43,040
but after outpatient

2258
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:46,040
It's now going to be treated with a type of radiation

2259
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:48,040
because in the blood vessels

2260
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:51,040
there's no way to do it again

2261
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,040
This symptom is what the director just mentioned

2262
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,040
just dizzy

2263
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:00,060
headaches sleep disturbances energy disturbances

2264
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,160
There is one more serious

2265
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,300
emotionally unstable

2266
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,460
a good day a bad day

2267
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,300
Now if the machine tracks

2268
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:11,900
It uses a method called radiation

2269
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:13,500
radiation therapy

2270
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:16,800
Radiation therapy I further understand is to use

2271
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,800
Noni knife

2272
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,960
It's right to treat with a Noni knife

2273
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,860
Then I want to ask the Commissioner

2274
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:27,800
This noni knife treatment will have

2275
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:29,400
What are the side effects?

2276
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,900
Thanks

2277
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:33,100
By the way, let me tell you about the pituitary gland

2278
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:36,100
The pituitary gland flow is quite special

2279
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,900
it grows in the center of the brain

2280
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,600
pituitary fossa

2281
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,700
grow out of that

2282
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:44,300
grow one

2283
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,600
The biggest one is that it affects just

2284
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:51,300
it's just under that forty gold cross

2285
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,500
so when it gets up

2286
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:55,000
The first one goes to the top of the four-cross

2287
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,100
what would a quadruple cross cause

2288
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,800
two sided horses

2289
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Now suddenly you feel that this person often has this

2290
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I wonder why this person suddenly became so proud

2291
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I'm not happy with this big hello

2292
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Because he can't see clearly on either side of the outside.

2293
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
so sometimes you don't know you're driving

2294
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
easy to change pressure to get

2295
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Someone gets you on the walk and you don't even know

2296
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
So when you walk, you will meet this edge

2297
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
because he can't see

2298
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
So he pressed from the optic chiasm

2299
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
so he will

2300
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
So after the surgery

2301
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
He's such a cute question

2302
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I think your symptoms should be fine.

2303
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Those who are cute are good

2304
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
is very stable now

2305
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
but he said it makes sense

2306
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I know

2307
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
This is because he might be on the alarm cat

2308
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
stick on it

2309
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
It is risky to stick to it and then take it

2310
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
use that noni knife

2311
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
We call it radiosurgery

2312
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,700
It is different from radiation therapy

2313
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,160
Radiation therapy is just radiation that

2314
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:07,460
The radiology surgery is inside the computer.

2315
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:08,960
it's only a little bit

2316
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,960
but it's pretty accurate

2317
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,000
It turns front and back, left and right

2318
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Any distance can be calculated

2319
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,500
it follows that place

2320
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,500
all the light is concentrated there

2321
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,500
burn that bit

2322
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:22,000
what about this

2323
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,500
It's like putting that point

2324
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,800
destroy the whole

2325
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,700
brain damage

2326
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:31,200
But it has little chance of injuring surrounding tissue

2327
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:34,200
But there are also a few

2328
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,700
so still

2329
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,200
of course there is a chance

2330
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,700
but rarely

2331
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,700
because it is very accurate

2332
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:44,700
So I guess this way is right

2333
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,700
that if you open it again

2334
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:47,700
sometimes that

2335
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,200
What if the arteries lose blood?

2336
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:52,200
or how suddenly broke

2337
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,700
That's dangerous too

2338
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,700
I think the doctor was very right in judging

2339
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Come, Director Liang

2340
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I think because of time

2341
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,720
probably the last question

2342
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:05,520
OK

2343
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:06,920
OK I want to ask a fact

2344
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,120
It's a practical question

2345
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:13,320
Although the dean Cheng Wu just said that

2346
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,600
Director for promoting this

2347
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,800
relationship with security

2348
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,520
Saved 3,000 lives a year

2349
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,120
but in fact

2350
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,760
This affects other

2351
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,000
The Business of a Brain Surgeon

2352
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:26,720
so i want to ask

2353
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,760
have you ever been scolded or

2354
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,960
I was surprised to say

2355
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,360
we used to be surgeons

2356
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,480
everyone is very loving

2357
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,520
so i was surprised

2358
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,280
When it was promoted in Taipei City for the first time

2359
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:44,360
Ward suddenly reduced by one-third

2360
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:47,960
I don't see anyone complaining

2361
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,960
when the second push

2362
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,480
that's even worse

2363
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,040
Because like many young physicians

2364
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,760
It's all based on this night

2365
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,760
life in these emergency rooms

2366
01:39:58,760 --> 01:39:59,920
suddenly gone

2367
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:06,140
It suddenly disappeared. It turned out to be a five-day knife in a week.

2368
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,960
less than one a week

2369
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,280
Taipei City in particular fell very fast

2370
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:17,160
But everyone is very used to it and thinks that saying this

2371
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:24,060
Including me, I don't think anyone opens these, and if it's safe to scold my brother, no one should open them

2372
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:30,200
But he just can't do it like this, so fortunately no one complained, but a group complained

2373
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:35,580
keep learning, keep learning

2374
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:44,800
No, all of a sudden, there were five or six hundred in a month, and suddenly there were two or three hundred left

2375
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,860
less car accidents

2376
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,700
This is another discovery, that

2377
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,500
God's other star, no one complains

2378
01:40:54,260 --> 01:40:55,340
i admire them

2379
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,640
Thanks

2380
01:40:57,640 --> 01:41:00,200
I'm here to thank you very very much

2381
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Thank you very much Director

2382
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
If it wasn't for the director

2383
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
you advocate hard hats

2384
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I could maybe 10 years ago

2385
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I will become a professional

2386
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
really thank you very much

2387
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I think the director is blessed

2388
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
all taxi groups

2389
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Thanks

2390
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
our speech today

2391
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
come to apply

2392
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
this time we

2393
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Thank you Director for giving us a new speech

2394
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Thank you also for the people

2395
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Contribution of working with him
