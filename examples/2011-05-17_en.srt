00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,480
lecture starts

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,000
We ask Vice President Wang Huijun to host for us

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,880
clap your hands

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,500
Thank you for listening to our knowledge quiz

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,660
We think every knowledge test is very good

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today I want to say good night first

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so today we are happy

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We invite Professor Zhang Wen

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Our fellows are part of the Academia Sinica

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Researcher at the Institute of Biology

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Come tell us a story about this virus

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
he got good grades

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
virus is with you

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Maybe it's with us now

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But his English is also very good

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Surfing with the viruses

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I think everyone is quite aware of the virus

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
what's going on

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But Teacher Zhang Wen is an expert among experts in this field

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So we are very happy to have this opportunity

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Please come to him and talk us deep forward out of the way

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come tell us some stories about this virus

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
either knowledge or

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Teacher Zhang Wen is from the Department of Agrochemicals, National Taiwan University

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,140
When I graduated in 1982

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,040
Go to the U.S. after graduation

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,840
是University of Washington

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,760
I Washington University

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,960
University of Washington

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,080
University of Washington in Washington

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,000
west america university

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,480
Get a Ph.D. in hygiene and immunology

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,240
Then to Mashenri Public School

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,840
go to cancer center

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,720
doing postdoctoral research

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
I saw where he went in 1989

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,960
I had already left by then

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
So I didn't overlap with you

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,040
After Zhang Wen returned to Taiwan

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,240
in our avatar

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
I always talk about biochemistry

46
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,200
Excuse me

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,560
That doppelgänger is almost gone

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,440
do research

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,000
There have been very outstanding results along the way.

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,880
Then I won the outstanding awards from everyone in this country, etc.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,120
So important is our kind

52
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Internationally

53
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
if you want a

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,160
This well-known reader is often invited to such international journals

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,500
Journal Virology

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
And the editorial board members of the two journals of Virology

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
it's not easy

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,500
So do we warmly welcome our Professor Zhang Wen to talk to us today?

59
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Thanks

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Thank you, Dean Wang Fu

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,500
Goodnight everybody

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,900
I am very glad to have this opportunity to talk to you about the virus today

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
In fact, today's topic is called Virus is by your side

64
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,900
this is the wind

65
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,400
That topic today is the virus is by your side

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Well, today’s topic is actually not about all viruses.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Well, I've been doing virus research for about twenty years.

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
then my favorite virus

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,900
So today I'm going to force you to share with me

70
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
that's a pox virus

71
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,400
Well, this pox virus is actually no stranger in our history.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,900
So let's just talk about this virus with a few stories

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,760
that has something to do with us

74
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,000
so let's talk about

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Why do I have to say in my title

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,360
virus is with you

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,600
Well I think basically the concept

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
It is because the virus is very small

79
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Excuse me

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,360
because the virus is small

81
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,640
so when it's next to us

82
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,800
Actually we don't know

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,560
The second is to say

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,760
Because of the virus, it actually follows the footsteps

85
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
so it's always next to us

86
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,560
it's not like bacteria

87
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,160
Bacteria can replicate without us

88
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,960
But the virus is real time

89
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,160
must remember

90
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,760
so it's actually wrapping around

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,360
by our side

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,720
the most important one is

93
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
it's everywhere

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
So along with remembering it's actually everywhere

95
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,160
So in fact, to avoid such a

96
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,520
a virus

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,720
next to us

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,120
almost very difficult

99
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
let me make an example

100
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
How about a virus

101
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,920
we all know

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,720
The definition of a virus is

103
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,160
Able to pass through some filtering instruments

104
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
If I make an analogy here

105
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,920
Here is the cowpea virus that we often experiment with

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
is a fighting virus

107
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,240
Its size is only about 350nm

108
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,540
nano is 10 to the negative 9th power

109
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,440
So in fact we can't see it with an optical microscope

110
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,640
Then you have to use the electron microscope

111
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,440
magnification optical microscope

112
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,680
About usually 100x to 400x

113
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,640
is invisible

114
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,680
Usually we have to enter tens of thousands of times

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,980
or 50,000 times

116
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,480
so you can start to see the shape

117
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,080
The structure is still very unclear.

118
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
Often times you have to re-enter

119
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,880
The so-called diffraction of X-rays

120
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,320
or more sophisticated instruments

121
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,520
You can see the structure on its surface

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,820
so it's actually very, very small

123
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,000
The second one is that we have measured

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
Collaborate with Mr. Zhang Hongzheng

125
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
measured the mass of the virus

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
The quality of the virus

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,440
a particle

128
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,600
If it is a particle, it is probably

129
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,080
it has very little mass

130
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,280
5 out of 10 minus 15 grams

131
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,920
If the algorithm is called 5 final grains

132
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,440
In simple terms

133
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,040
That number might sound like...

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
let's talk about it

135
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,100
if you just imagine a

136
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,200
After playing a spray T

137
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
The sprayed mist

138
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,600
In terms of volume

139
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,500
probably a microliter

140
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,600
Let's talk about its volume

141
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,200
If its density is 1 then

142
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,500
you squirt out

143
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,200
the number of viruses on it

144
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,300
possibly hundreds of millions

145
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,600
So in this case

146
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,500
In fact, in our daily life, we often

147
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,300
Walking without knowing it 24 hours a day

148
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,700
something like this

149
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,300
Of course

150
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,100
That scientist likes to tune a book

151
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,100
talking about why we do these studies

152
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,500
It's good to take the opportunity to promote

153
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,300
Of course everyone can think of that one

154
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,300
is in our life

155
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,600
Since viruses are everywhere

156
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
to our life

157
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,700
to our health

158
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,500
to our economy

159
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,800
will definitely have some impact

160
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
that many examples

161
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,900
everyone can imagine

162
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,700
Every day when I open the newspaper

163
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,200
flu virus

164
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,800
or hepatitis virus

165
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
These are all imaginable

166
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
that for those of us who do the research

167
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
when walking into the experiment

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,100
Viruses have another layer on us

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
attraction

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,700
That is to say, because of his simplicity

171
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,200
his small his simple

172
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,100
When we study to understand the origin of life

173
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,800
When wanting to understand something about the mechanisms that work in our body

174
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,000
In fact, viruses are a very good biological system to start with.

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,600
Let me use an example

176
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,300
we all know by now

177
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,200
composition of life words

178
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
a lot of deoxyribonucleic acid

179
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000
that was in 1960

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
This is a Central Dog

181
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
it's immutable

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But in fact the first evidence

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,800
An extension of this concept is the reverse entry virus

184
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,200
His Geno

185
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,800
That means his genome is not actually a DN

186
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,700
We're talking about ribonucleic acid

187
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,600
So this is overturned

188
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,100
The idea that DNA is the only genome

189
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,800
That's inside a virus

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
his genome

191
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Here is an example

192
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,800
The second one said that everyone is very concerned about it now.

193
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,000
The treatment of cancer or the origin of cancer

194
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,900
In fact, the earliest to know

195
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,000
when cancer occurs

196
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
also caused by a virus

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
body of a muscle

198
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that produced a gene

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The gene brought in by this virus is called SARC

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
what about this

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
it will make the muscle body

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
generate some meat flow

203
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So it's from the genes like this

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Everyone is starting to realize

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
original cell regulation of cell division

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
may be caused by

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The real cause of so-called cancer

208
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
all these are

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
some of the creatures we grew up with

210
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
something like a virus

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Extend some of its principles

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
draw some of its conclusions

213
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then you can start applying it to larger

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
some

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Inside complex biological systems

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so this is for us

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Doing research is actually very, very

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
a property of attraction

219
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course, there is another one mentioned in the middle

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That is to say, the virus must survive

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
this is it

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
we talk about the selfish gene

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it's the only law

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
it has to survive

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
so it has a very important

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
very important feature

227
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is that it often mutates

228
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
that everyone thinks

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Women are fickle

230
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
people are fickle

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Children are also fickle

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
mom said

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
My child is the most fickle

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
But the fact is that viruses are very fickle.

235
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
That's one of the strengths of our research

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,300
Because of its fickleness and its adaptation and its evolution

237
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
There is an inseparable relationship between

238
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,400
study its changes

239
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,900
Help us understand what is called survival

240
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,500
So these are the times to study viruses

241
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,000
very interesting for some reasons

242
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,400
In the end, of course

243
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,000
if we can understand it

244
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,400
If you know yourself and your enemy

245
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,300
Of course we can apply it in reverse

246
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
That can be said in different fields

247
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
to find a way to use it

248
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,100
and then do what we want it to do

249
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,400
That's because there are many types of viruses

250
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
I just said Wang Fuwen

251
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,100
Are there 100,000 or 200,000 types of viruses?

252
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
then i just

253
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't know how many tens of thousands of viruses there are

254
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,200
But basically we can imagine what we just mentioned, that is,

255
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Whether it has 50,000 or 100,000 species

256
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,700
just mentioned that is to say

257
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,000
it has to change

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
if it starts with five

259
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,700
it has to change

260
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,300
It creeps more and it creeps less

261
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
But the point is that it has to keep changing

262
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,100
Then break through to get a new balance

263
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,900
Then the virus we are mainly talking about today

264
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,300
It's actually Douban

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This may not be a virus that you often hear

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It may be less talked about in newspapers and magazines

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then if we look at the classification of viruses

268
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Generally we will divide by his genetic makeup

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This is a basic

270
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That is, if he is

271
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
ribonucleic acid as his genetic makeup

272
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the way words are copied

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's call him RNA virus

274
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If he uses deoxyribonucleic acid

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
as his genetic makeup

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's call him a DNA virus

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then everyone in Taiwan often hears that

278
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Viruses, kids have diarrhea

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
or flaviviruses like dengue virus

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
retroviruses like HIV

281
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Ebola virus, he is a very virulent

282
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
or flu virus

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Whether it's love flu

284
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
or human influenza virus

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
These are all RNA viruses

286
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Then their mutations are actually faster in general

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Then the virus we are going to talk about today

288
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Actually a DNA virus

289
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What about DNA viruses?

290
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
it's easier for you to hear

291
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
e.g. herpes virus

292
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That mouth sometimes breaks

293
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that is

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,400
He also uses deoxyribose to diagnose viruses

295
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,600
nucleic acid as his genome

296
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
What about the pox virus we are talking about today?

297
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,000
right in this corner

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
He also uses DNA

299
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Then he is in this corner because now

300
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,500
He probably knew that ten or fifteen years ago

301
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,200
he is

302
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,400
We can always say he is the biggest virus

303
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,000
Now there is an amoeba-infected

304
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
mimi virus

305
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,700
that becomes the biggest virus

306
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,600
so he is the second most virus

307
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,400
ok, then this reflects

308
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,600
Its size is large because of its complexity

309
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,900
And after he is in the middle of the evolution process

310
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,000
It will talk to these small viruses of another Spectrum

311
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Strategy that may be used on evolution

312
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
that

313
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,500
not the same

314
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,800
Then we will discuss a few today

315
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
It is more related to our human society

316
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
One is the smallpox virus

317
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,100
The general virus is divided according to his records

318
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
what about our pox virus

319
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,900
If he is infected with vertebrate

320
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,000
right here

321
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,200
If it's an insect infestation, it goes here.

322
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,400
What are we talking about today?

323
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,900
it's all here

324
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,000
the first is to look at the other

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
Smallpox virus inside history

326
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Although the smallpox virus is currently

327
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,200
out of human society

328
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,500
we are in society

329
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,300
In fact, there is no such thing as smallpox virus anymore.

330
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,200
spread in the human world

331
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,700
But in history

332
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,500
It is probably the most vicious virus

333
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,400
From a historical point of view

334
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,300
It's actually a very old disease

335
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,000
its history presumably goes back

336
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,800
1200 BC

337
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
that there is no direct evidence

338
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,300
looking at indirect evidence

339
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,000
The most important piece of evidence

340
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That is to say, in ancient Egypt

341
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,500
This Pharaoh Ramus V

342
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,700
On the face of his mummies

343
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,700
in fact here

344
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,800
some like

345
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,100
acne scar marks

346
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,700
and places like these

347
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,100
That's actually a scientist who tried to

348
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,900
want to be able to get from the top of these skins

349
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,100
Try to see if you can separate

350
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,200
genes of some viruses

351
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,300
but so far

352
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,000
Haven't heard any positive news yet

353
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,100
what they separated

354
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
It's still normal

355
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
uninfected skin

356
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,500
So the current technology is of course hoping to find

357
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,600
more direct evidence

358
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,500
But with a symptom like his

359
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,200
can almost be deduced to say

360
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,800
around 1200 AD

361
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
in human society

362
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,500
There are already traces of the smallpox virus

363
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,000
what about the other one

364
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
There is also no direct evidence

365
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,800
However, according to historians

366
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,300
At this time of 4400 BC

367
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,500
Athens vs Sparta

368
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,300
that often

369
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,300
War is a so-called

370
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,700
A hotbed of activities like Pluck and Virus

371
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,900
Although we just mentioned

372
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,400
Viruses often like to mutate

373
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,100
and then be able to adapt to his life

374
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,400
But in the middle of the process

375
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,700
Human beings are absolutely pushing and blocking

376
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,400
because once the war

377
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,800
whole living conditions

378
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,100
man's permanence

379
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,300
Then what about living conditions

380
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,400
Hygienic conditions have all declined.

381
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,800
So that's basically a hotbed of spread.

382
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,300
So in this historian's record, when

383
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,200
they will often refer to

384
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
human body, especially limbs

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
there will be some erythema

386
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Then what

387
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
they have a fever

388
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then what

389
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
the whole thing is

390
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Most obvious in smallpox is its

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The farther away from the mid-birth zone

392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
it's whole will be more

393
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Those like these are basically some descriptions above

394
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
let everyone deduce that

395
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
In fact to the vid

396
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
four hundred years ago

397
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Smallpox has already begun to spread in Europe

398
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
In fact, China also has the so-called

399
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
this smallpox record

400
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's probably around this B.C.

401
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
more than three hundred years ago

402
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
that time

403
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
because he thought he came in from the outside

404
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So it's called Lu Chuang

405
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Then what

406
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
he had one of the earliest

407
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
A process on a written record

408
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When Ge Hong entered the court

409
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
he often writes

410
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He wrote many books about medicine

411
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you speak now

412
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He's probably a pretty good epidemiologist.

413
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
or an epidemiologist

414
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Because he didn't just record

415
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This possible smallpox situation

416
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He actually recorded

417
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Like rabies or an immediate hoof stab

418
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,880
some other infectious diseases

419
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,200
Some conditions that develop in patients

420
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,760
According to the interpretation of ordinary people, this book

421
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,920
kind of like a

422
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I wear this on my hand after I leave

423
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,200
Then a first aid manual looks a bit like this

424
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,640
There are some words in it

425
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,240
what about these words

426
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,320
Basically, it is similar to smallpox in modern times

427
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,200
Development looks relevant

428
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,760
He said he had a sore and his face was in a hurry

429
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,960
because it is systemic

430
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,320
Xu Yu Zhou Zha

431
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,680
it's all over

432
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,040
Strong as a fire window

433
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,840
Because it actually has some redness

434
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,760
Then in the white chapter there will be

435
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,320
melt this liquid

436
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,800
Take it with you

437
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
As long as it breaks, it will fall apart again

438
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,840
If not cured, those who refuse will die

439
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,040
So the death rate is actually very high

440
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:48,960
That

441
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,440
Don't talk about today we say we are in China

442
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,200
In fact, when in Europe

443
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,560
or

444
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,080
in America

445
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,880
This smallpox was actually

446
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,040
It is a very serious social disease

447
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,600
We mentioned that in more than 100 AD

448
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,840
In fact, a very famous man named Antony Pluck

449
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,440
That's the fact that we're back again

450
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,940
this is the roman empire at war

451
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,640
What about the time of war?

452
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,440
Of course it's a waste of time

453
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,640
So what about the people in the city?

454
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,480
Because it's hard to count that number

455
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,160
But history books record about 30% of the population

456
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,600
In fact all rose because of smallpox

457
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,400
then in this situation

458
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,800
In fact, the Roman Empire has no way to survive

459
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
his power

460
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,000
You can see that it is said in history

461
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,100
In fact, only disease does not distinguish between rich and poor

462
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,300
I colleagues

463
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,100
So there is no distinction between Chinese and foreign in history

464
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,800
In fact, there are quite a few of these palace nobles and even kings

465
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,500
He actually had some symptoms of smallpox when he died

466
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,600
Then of course in this case

467
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,700
There is no such thing as the burial etiquette of the royal family.

468
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,000
Then all the common people and their relatives

469
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and inheritance

470
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,640
The sons of the throne are practically shunned

471
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,440
That was a lot of times

472
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,400
Their historians have documented such a process

473
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,800
So you can see that is

474
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,040
at that moment

475
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,480
In fact, the toxicity of this disease has nothing to do with its dissemination

476
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,520
In fact, it is already in everyday life

477
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,160
must encounter

478
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,880
So even if

479
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,680
It can also be seen in the literature

480
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,080
a record like this

481
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,400
in this record

482
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,320
The traces of smallpox on a girl's face

483
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,360
written down and quoted

484
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,360
puppy on black flower

485
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,160
So this smallpox

486
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,680
with a horror shot

487
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,680
Level Terrors at the Fair

488
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
to this beautiful girl

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
scary look at it like this

490
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,160
or give her some threatening scares

491
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,880
Rifle every use for grace

492
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
In these young and elegant bodies

493
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
attack

494
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,000
left the remand of a face

495
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,600
so left some marks on the face

496
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,240
So in fact no matter in the medical record

497
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,400
Or in fact, the textual research on the literature

498
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,640
can see the ceiling

499
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,840
In fact, many records have been left in human society.

500
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,400
That day the flowers arrived in America is actually a

501
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,960
It's actually quite a feeling that this

502
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,000
this very sad story

503
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
because when we are infected

504
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,600
There is a concept that

505
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,800
If today a whole group

506
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,520
It doesn't have any herd immunity of its own

507
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,080
It has never seen a virus like this

508
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,680
or when a bacterium

509
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,720
Once you have a full-scale invasion

510
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,280
In fact, there is no resistance at all

511
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,760
when in america

512
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,080
In fact, this is the case

513
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
Because when European immigrants entered from Spain

514
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,080
When entering from Central and South America

515
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,280
met the indians of south america

516
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,960
Of course it's because the culture is different

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Many times they will initially

518
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,640
would be in awe of these Spanish immigrants

519
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,900
then later

520
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,600
There will be conflicts and wars

521
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Among the immigrants brought

522
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
someone has smallpox

523
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,400
So it was passed on to the local aborigines

524
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,200
So in fact at that time

525
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,600
two major empires

526
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,200
Azac and the so-called Inkars

527
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,300
The two South American cultures

528
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,400
In fact within a few decades

529
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,200
In fact, because of the invasion of smallpox

530
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,700
disappears soon

531
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Then smallpox's footprint goes from South America and up

532
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
that went to north america again

533
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,400
When it entered North America

534
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
British immigrants, of course, took smallpox

535
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Brought to the New World

536
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,800
When taking to the New World

537
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
Indigenous Indians actually have

538
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,600
once allied with the armies of france

539
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
hope to drive the british away

540
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
The result is in the middle of the process

541
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,600
England has a general

542
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Called Jeffrey Amist

543
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,000
he moved one

544
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,100
a bad thought

545
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,920
he thought

546
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,320
I can't win the battle today

547
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,260
I can't convince these aborigines to cooperate with me

548
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,860
Then their extravagance

549
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,660
what should I do

550
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,760
So he conspired with several people

551
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,060
These are all documented

552
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,220
in fact they

553
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,360
very famous is

554
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,660
They sprinkled the smallpox virus on this

555
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,700
straight up

556
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,320
then sent to the aborigines

557
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,120
That aborigines got this

558
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,620
So in fact the entire Tribe is here

559
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,160
was greatly affected

560
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,080
So this is probably our human history

561
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,760
You can see the first very malicious exploit of smallpox

562
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,880
as a so-called biochemical record

563
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
that threat

564
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,520
Of course it is very small in terms of the current perspective

565
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,160
But we came back to say that

566
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,680
if you today

567
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,560
In a group, there is no resistance at all

568
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
History like this is very likely to repeat itself

569
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,720
Then come another history of human beings

570
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,420
have such serious influence

571
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,880
how is it contagious

572
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
is it possible

573
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,760
To avoid such an infection or to prevent

574
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,640
When it was contagious, we just mentioned

575
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,400
because of his

576
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
his

577
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,320
E-roll is his sneeze

578
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,360
In fact, it can be dispersed in the air

579
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,040
It is also recorded in the history that

580
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,000
In fact, in the hospital environment

581
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,680
Just like SARS at that time

582
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,480
In fact, they do have a hospital

583
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,840
Some evidence of cluster infection

584
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,120
The most common is actually the so-called

585
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
easy contact

586
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,800
family

587
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,520
Then or touch him

588
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,760
These things that appear when you are sick

589
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,760
these homes

590
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,480
or infected clothing

591
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,920
When people like this are actually exposed to infection

592
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,880
often there will be

593
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,600
doesn't seem to have much to say today

594
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,200
smallpox depends on food

595
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
by eating or drinking

596
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,880
It seems that there is no such direct evidence

597
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,840
Generally speaking, what we just mentioned

598
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,520
way of infection

599
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,080
Then there's another thing, it's actually the virus.

600
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,560
A very important feature is the

601
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
he can't help

602
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,760
leaning on insects

603
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
Or run with other animals

604
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,700
So this point is that we humans can exterminate smallpox

605
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,500
a very very very important reason

606
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,800
That is to say, today it is trapped in this

607
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,500
In this ancestor worship environment

608
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,300
If today it can run elsewhere

609
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,800
other animals

610
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Then wait until the future to jump back into human society

611
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,900
Then it will be very difficult for you to exterminate such a virus

612
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,800
so it is so far no

613
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,600
Didn't know it could use insect bites

614
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,100
or springtails or other animals to deliver

615
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,100
This is a limitation of the smallpox virus

616
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,100
Then its influence on that disease

617
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,400
In fact, smallpox is because of the current molecular biology

618
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
very developed

619
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,500
So many times in the early days in the hospital

620
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,400
Some virus strains in the hospital will be isolated

621
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,500
people now

622
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,840
take it all out

623
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,760
Then he reordered the

624
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,040
find a way to get some of this

625
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,240
These viruses in the previous hospital

626
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
all sequenced

627
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Then you can see their comparison

628
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,940
Then basically we can put

629
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,120
Smallpox is divided into two categories

630
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,440
more serious category

631
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,840
its english name is

632
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
Smallpox

633
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,480
If those ten people are probably infected

634
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,780
three to four people will die

635
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,980
So the death rate is about 30% to 40%.

636
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,780
The other category is called Verola Minor

637
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,020
Its death rate is lower

638
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,360
about 1%

639
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,760
So in fact, in many diseased plants, when

640
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,960
while on the internet

641
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,360
Most of them are actually the sequence of Verola Major

642
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,260
Then many scientists will be in these sequences

643
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,000
to find some possible clues

644
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,700
Sorry, there will be a few more later

645
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,500
Although everyone just had dinner

646
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,300
may be a little uncomfortable

647
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,640
That's basically what we walked through very quickly

648
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,040
make you feel

649
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
This is actually a human disease

650
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,340
Then when you saw the course of these illnesses

651
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,860
Actually you will understand this

652
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,200
this virus is fast

653
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,300
It goes on fast in our body

654
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,900
probably terrible

655
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,900
That means today

656
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,900
its what we call

657
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,700
this incubation period

658
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,000
Its disease is divided into several levels

659
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,900
What about the incubation period?

660
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,000
Actually, you can't see anything sick about it.

661
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,200
The second one is about to get sick.

662
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,500
May have some symptoms

663
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,300
But the skin is still

664
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,700
not so obvious

665
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,000
And most importantly of course

666
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,200
It has a variety of this blob itself

667
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,500
in the middle of this process

668
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,700
Because of its shape it is divided into different stages

669
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,000
What about these stages?

670
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
go the whole way the whole way

671
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,900
about two to three weeks

672
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,100
Then there is one more thing in the middle of this process

673
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,900
What scientists have discovered is that

674
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,200
The incubation period we just talked about

675
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,600
about seven to ten days

676
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,700
during this time

677
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,700
The patient is not infectious

678
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,400
That is to say, during this time

679
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,000
actually it goes everywhere

680
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,200
The chances of it infecting others are actually not very good.

681
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That's the same as the influenza virus

682
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Or other viruses are very different

683
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Many times it is like the tuberculosis we talked about

684
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
it sometimes has no needles

685
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Then this person may actually be infected.

686
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
He is when he goes around

687
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
you do not know

688
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Then he will infect more people

689
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But smallpox is the other way around

690
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
When he didn't have this sick needle

691
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
In fact, his infectious power is high

692
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Then I knew he started to have a fever

693
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Then these homes on the surface

694
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Start with some flat pillows

695
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
then to the raised pillow

696
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Then go inside and start having

697
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
fluid inflamed fluid

698
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Hua Nong

699
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
After the last dry

700
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Run away from home

701
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
in the middle of the process

702
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
his contagiousness

703
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
the experiments they did

704
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
probably look at that

705
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
When these organizations

706
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You can see the yellow line telling you

707
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
really contagious

708
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Usually it's his surface that's already showing up

709
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Then you can imagine that

710
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
If a person is walking down the street

711
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
when he was covered with scars

712
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,200
everyone will stay away from him

713
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,800
So this spread of the virus

714
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,800
Actually it's not a good thing

715
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,800
Well, of course you can also imagine

716
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,300
Later, when the United Nations, everyone in the world

717
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,300
when trying to eradicate smallpox

718
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,800
To observe patients with smallpox

719
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
This is also a very important condition

720
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,800
That is to say

721
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,100
That is to say, these medical staff

722
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,400
In fact, they can quickly see that

723
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,100
who might start to be contagious

724
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
then you can go

725
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,000
Go to the main character's contact with other people

726
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,500
This is the time to help him limit his walks

727
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,000
a very important condition

728
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,900
The other one is to wait for him, of course, to get to know the house.

729
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,200
In fact, these homes are actually contagious.

730
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,100
Then we just mentioned that

731
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,800
He is divided into several types

732
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
The death rate we are talking about is relatively high

733
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,700
Called Veirola Major

734
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,400
Then he has one we call

735
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,900
The most common is called Odinary Type

736
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,700
a lot of it is on the flying nose

737
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,100
Actually in Europe

738
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Also when this smallpox entered Europe

739
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
When Northern Europe and Western Europe

740
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,240
many times

741
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
You'll see his mortality inside when

742
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,500
A very high percentage are children

743
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,700
Then of course we can guess

744
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,500
That is to say, the development of children's immunity

745
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,240
actually weaker than adults

746
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,500
what about the other

747
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,140
In fact, relatively rare

748
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,500
I think you often read it in textbooks

749
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,000
The relatively rare one is actually called Flat type

750
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,840
It doesn't actually have what we just mentioned

751
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,900
ginger or strong

752
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,100
Well it's actually a rash all over

753
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
very thick

754
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,400
And then this patient

755
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
In fact it's a very serious kind of

756
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,900
form of smallpox

757
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,700
Because the patient is actually in a coma

758
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,900
then in fact

759
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,400
It's not like this

760
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,200
able to respond

761
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,500
the third one is scarier

762
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,600
It's called Hemorrhage

763
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,500
Hemorrhage is

764
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,400
just bleeding

765
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,500
bleeding disorder

766
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,400
that is, it bleeds under the skin

767
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
or systemic hemorrhage

768
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
some phenomena

769
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,700
Generally speaking

770
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,000
The meaning of this may be that it

771
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,700
In addition to the spread of the virus

772
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,900
Possibly some immune-inflammation

773
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
some other role

774
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,800
in progress

775
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,560
That's because it's a person's background

776
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
And because in fact this

777
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,560
These smallpox are actually a stunt now

778
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,920
So we actually

779
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,120
Looking back on such a dangerous disease

780
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,480
In fact, we don't know much about

781
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,040
because of its danger

782
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,040
So it caused a distance for us to study it

783
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
So in fact, even today

784
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,200
It currently does not exist in human society

785
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,160
But we have a lot of serious pathology like this

786
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,560
In fact, its nature is still unclear.

787
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,480
that just mentioned

788
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
This is some of them from CGC

789
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,080
Some clinical diagnoses

790
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,440
They will find that just mentioned

791
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,720
Once the current situation of bleeding occurs,

792
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,560
Almost 100% will die

793
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,640
If it was the spleen diagnosis just mentioned

794
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,080
It also has a particularly high mortality rate

795
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,880
The rest is about 30% to 50%

796
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,440
It's the Virula Major we're talking about

797
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,440
Of course, if today you have had acne before

798
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,160
Then your symptoms will be slightly relieved

799
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,960
That

800
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,160
Of course you don't need to talk

801
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It is said that smallpox will actually have some sequelae

802
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
i remember when i was little

803
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
In fact, Taiwan also has smallpox

804
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
because my mother is a friend

805
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
She actually had smallpox when she was little

806
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Those who stay can often see

807
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
There are scars on the face

808
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So these are actually right

809
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
common people's social

810
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
In fact, it has a very large impact

811
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But for those who do epidemiology

812
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
This is actually what they said in the trace

813
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the disease in this village

814
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
or this disease in this city

815
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
or how long the disease has developed in this place

816
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Then if you want to contain them

817
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
They are actually some data

818
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
with some research directions

819
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
In other words

820
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
There is another side effect

821
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That is because his infections are often systemic

822
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So there will be some people

823
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Although the disease is cured

824
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
His cornea

825
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
In fact, after being affected, there is blindness

826
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
or limbs

827
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because of some of the inflammation we just mentioned

828
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
or some festering condition

829
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Will have some physical effects

830
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
some disabilities

831
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Then there are often times in the clinic

832
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,600
It is often said that smallpox often

833
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
we fight virus

834
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,200
Sometimes with my colleagues or

835
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
when chatting

836
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,600
they will say

837
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,000
Is Zhang Wenshuidou also fighting viruses?

838
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,600
Then I want to say solemnly

839
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,800
Water beans are not fighting virus

840
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,200
Mizumame

841
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
I don't know why he is called Shui Dou in Chinese

842
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,800
Probably more water

843
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
That English is called chicken pops

844
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
You just turn it over and it's chickpeas

845
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Then he actually belongs to the

846
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,200
He is also a DNA virus

847
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,400
But he is a herpes virus

848
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,800
So that's a noticeable difference

849
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Of course beans are different

850
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400
These are also distributed differently

851
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
These have clinical differences

852
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,400
that's right

853
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,600
If we divide this virus into categories

854
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
The smallpox virus we just mentioned

855
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
He is usually on the patient

856
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,600
It is unlikely that there will be some medical history of so-called previous infection

857
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
Because usually the first time

858
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
it's serious and you can see it

859
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,000
But when it comes to chickenpox, these shingle pillow viruses

860
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,200
Usually we get chicken pox when we are very young

861
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,700
And what about this virus?

862
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,500
after posting

863
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,700
it goes to the ganglia in your body

864
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,600
it hibernates there

865
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,900
Then our body immunity actually suppresses it

866
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,500
so it stays inside the original cell

867
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,000
no harm to us

868
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
but peaceful coexistence

869
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,200
Then wait until you stay up late to study

870
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,300
get ready for the forest

871
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,200
then what

872
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,700
Meishuibao

873
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Then what

874
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,200
When your immune system goes down

875
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
it comes up

876
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,100
Therefore, when many children come to the exam

877
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,800
Just a lot of holes in the mouth

878
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,500
what about this

879
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
wait until you are immune

880
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,100
and temporarily clear it

881
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,600
it's back to that lurking place

882
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,500
So these different viruses

883
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,200
It may represent the same

884
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,300
but it is actually

885
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,000
are two completely different ones

886
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,500
The words here are actually true for some if

887
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
If there is someone who is more interested

888
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,600
Their mental retardation can be compared

889
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,100
That is to say, smallpox is actually long

890
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,300
The whole one that came out was swollen like this

891
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,440
And it's not actually like inside the beans

892
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,740
It's just that its water content is more

893
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,440
words here

894
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:12,140
In fact, it has more concentration and experience in the back

895
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,040
The second one is the distribution we just talked about

896
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,440
This is a smallpox in the medical field

897
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,940
very important demarcation point

898
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,780
That is to say, many diseases will cause blisters

899
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,000
assortment of bubbles

900
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,000
Why is it called this Smallpox

901
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,340
In fact, the earliest is because in ancient times

902
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,100
There is another one called Largepox

903
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,340
That's syphilis

904
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,340
There will be a picture of the beans produced by the syphilis later

905
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,140
so their bean shape

906
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,340
In fact, we look pretty much the same

907
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,300
People in the medical field see it differently

908
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,540
in terms of smallpox

909
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,540
its obvious one is the bean it's diseased on

910
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,740
usually away from your middle crispy body

911
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,540
the farther it goes the more

912
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,740
you can think about this

913
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,940
We don't know it's the blood circulation

914
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,140
Or with the tissue of these cells

915
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,640
what's the special relationship

916
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,440
But it's obviously going to be in the head

917
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,280
will be in hand

918
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,280
and then at...
