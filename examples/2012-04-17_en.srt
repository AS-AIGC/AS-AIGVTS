1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,460
Dept idea what the future could look like with Yaoi

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:18,980
So she gives da iceÂ´ elevator a nice new way or we could go out to hang out

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,460
So

4
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,300
and

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,580
then

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,860
you

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,860
because

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,160
free

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,060
it

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,160
remembrance

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,280
between

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,160
ah

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,700
distinguished guests

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,300
Tonight's speech was supposed to be hosted by Vice President Chen Jianren

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,900
But because Vice President Chen Jianren had to go abroad for work

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,500
so let me represent

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,200
Then the Senate of the Lee Academy was born in 1932

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,900
He told me not to talk too much

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
so what about me

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,400
I didn't prepare his information first.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,300
So let me just say

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,300
Well because he's very polite

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,100
Then he is the 20th academician of our academy

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,900
Academician Li received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the Department of Agrochemistry, National Taiwan University

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,300
Then came to the United States in 1958

26
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,200
University of Elva

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
Read in 1960 to get Ph.D. in biochemistry

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,100
Professor at Johns Hopkins University

29
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
until now

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,100
Then his research field is mainly this

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
In-class research

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,800
His research in this hall

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,500
my limited knowledge

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,000
Known is a very difficult field

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,600
then he is here

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,100
A very cutting-edge foundation in the field

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,800
scientific research

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,800
Then the hall is one of the main components of the cell

39
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,360
To understand the function of the hall, you must first decipher the structure

40
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,920
Over the years, a series of internal quantifications developed by Academician Li

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,480
qualitative analysis

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,640
Has become a model of micro analysis in the hall

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,760
Then there is a great achievement in this area

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,440
also won many awards

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
Then he told me not to talk about it.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,280
so i'm left

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,800
Please refer to yourself

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
In fact it's not just this

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,320
not just this there are many

50
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Well, what he's accomplished in this area is outstanding.

51
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,160
then in education

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,080
Research and other contributions are very admirable

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,160
Well of course he has an identity

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,800
He is Dean Li's brother

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
Well, I think everyone knows this

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,960
But what is the topic of his speech today?

57
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,160
It's beyond everyone's expectations

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,800
He's talking about the Columbian influence on Taiwanese food

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
I saw this topic two days ago

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,880
Surprised

61
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,640
I asked Academician Li, do you really want to talk about this topic?

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,840
real

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so i'm very curious

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
very curious

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Because this seems to have nothing to do with the hall

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But it seems to be wrong again

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We now give warm applause to Mr. Lee Yen Choi

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you Wang Guoyuan

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you for your help

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is also surprising

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Usually, this kind of speech is an expert's speech.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A less specialized way of talking about specialized things

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
what about me

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Is to talk about the influence of public forces Taiwanese food

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
then you can ask

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What qualifications do I have to say this?

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
i am not a historian

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
not a sociologist

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
not a linguist

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But what?

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The Duoduo sofa we make biochemical has something to do with food

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,480
I've also led for several years on food-related panels in the U.S.

83
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,880
then you can tell

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,360
Our lab also prints six or seven lessons of this cookbook

85
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,400
I think such words from netizens

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,240
Is it enough to talk about this topic?

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,440
enough enough

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,240
then it can be done

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,720
then the world is so big

90
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:46,800
Well, 26 of these major crops in the world

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,360
Eight of these are from the so-called New World

92
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,600
Then these 8 are the Malin tree fan tree

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,040
Cornwood Tree Tomato Chili

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
happening chocolate and vanilla

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll talk about every

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
After this bug every

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Plus a lot more

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
so i now explain

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This screen we are talking about

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
mostly in Chinese

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Alto Control

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
also only in english

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But English is very simple

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So I hope you can understand

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I left English on purpose

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then in this bug

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Seven of them are made in Taiwan

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So start with this

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Dried sweet potatoes and sweet potatoes

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sweet potatoes are often used in Taiwan

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
to describe its own

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then if you turn around late at night

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you can see a lot

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Seven hundred are all about sweet potatoes and dried potatoes

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
sweet potato thing

116
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,240
So

117
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,520
this is my name

118
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,780
panzi food sweet potato tomato blah blah blah

119
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,340
This is actually not too strange

120
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,620
because you are watching

121
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,380
You also read the previous things

122
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,820
zucchini pepper a lot of stuff

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
Most of this nonsense is pointing

124
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,020
Something from the West or the North Food

125
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,960
So what about Fanzi? This is Fanzi's.

126
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,920
And the food, mostly from the new road

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
So you just watch Fanzi

128
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,420
where the hell did the old one come from

129
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,120
What about a lot of this food? Its name is

130
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,160
with this history

131
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
factor there

132
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,040
then let's talk

133
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,600
Gansu liquid melon

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What about this, of course, in Latin?

135
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,200
Don't touch it, Watatas

136
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,160
five thousand years ago

137
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,040
Believe in what you say

138
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,220
human begins

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
start planting start improving

140
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,860
Then theirs were planted 5,000 years ago

141
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,600
not what we see now

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,300
So 5,000 years ago it was many of these farmers and so on

143
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,540
Both improved very differently

144
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,000
So don't think that five thousand years will be so good

145
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
where is the sweet potato

146
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,240
Sorry this point can only

147
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,240
Can only be used in the middle of this

148
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
Then both sides can not see

149
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,240
But you can do this progressive movement to the left and right

150
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,240
then you can also see

151
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,240
This one looks like the millennium flower, right?

152
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,240
In fact, this is the subject of the same genus

153
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Then I will talk about the innermost thing later.

154
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
There were many, many

155
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
So

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let me tell you, there is no need to talk about this, sweet potatoes can also be boiled, baked, and many things can be cooked

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Honey sweet potato will be discussed in more detail later

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
One advantage is that the sweet potato experience can also be eaten

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I just ate this even if I didnât speak Chinese

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How did sweet potatoes come to Taiwan?

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
there are many stories

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What I want to introduce to you now is the honey sweet potato cultural system

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is quoted in this book

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Spanish sailors first brought this dried potato to the Philippines

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you remember that the Philippines was controlled by Spain for a while

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So of course the Spaniards can bring this thing to the Philippines

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The Philippines can be considered part of the country of Spain

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It is strictly prohibited to export and cannot be exported

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
However, what is forbidden

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Everyone knows how Yan Duoduo has a way

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
move out, can do that

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Not only the Chinese, other countries will be like this

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hu Jianren and Chen Yi introduced China from the Philippines

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's just a sneak attack

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Exactly a few years later, in 1993, Hu Jian had a violent attack

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hu Jian already had a lot of aggressive defenses

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hell is not good and the weather is not good

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So this year, Chen Yi's son

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The students at that time called him to grow sweet potatoes

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to improve blood volume

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Then, there is another post, Chen Yi posted in Dong Huan

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
In 1963, he talked about the aboriginal farming in Gansu

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,640
Spaniards once also came to the northern part of Taiwan

184
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,440
At that time, it may also bring Gansu

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,320
Then there is also evidence that redhead fish and Taitung are growing in Gansu

186
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,040
This was discovered by the South China people

187
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,160
Of course, it is very likely that it emerged from the other side.

188
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,520
Well, especially if you've heard

189
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,000
When Zheng Chenggong first arrived in Taiwan

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
he wasn't prepared

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,400
That is to say, he did not prepare the food for his 30,000 people

192
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,960
Fortunately, Taiwan has been able to grow Gansu

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,720
According to the Spanish cultural system

194
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,560
They can plant Gansu for two months

195
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,760
three month army

196
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,600
so pretty good

197
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,960
So why are sweet potatoes sweet?

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Take a few people. Small sweet potatoes are sweet

199
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,240
Not very

200
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,740
It is directly influenced by the fact that sweet potatoes are sweet

201
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,240
why is it sweet

202
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,640
Because it has a little more length

203
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,140
a little more than this usual sheep feather

204
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,940
But this one is only a small part

205
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,940
Then the sweet potato contains electricity to remove catabolites

206
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,080
So it can decompose the electricity in the sweet potato

207
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,280
So if you are interested in making a comparison

208
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,380
If you bake the sweet potatoes in a resistance oven, they won't be sweet

209
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
not too sweet

210
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,580
So if you are afraid of sweets, I think few people are afraid of sweets

211
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,480
If so, you can use a resistance grill to bake it.

212
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,680
As long as you go with a normal oven

213
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,780
Just dry and crispy but very sweet

214
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,420
feel very sweet

215
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,620
There was a candied radish just now.

216
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,420
put a handful of dried crisps in

217
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,240
If you boil it slowly in a normal pot

218
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,500
becomes very very sweet

219
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,840
Everyone, I think anyone who has a commemoration of his release knows this.

220
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,340
So what is the nutrition of sweet potato

221
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,940
The biggest feature is that it has vitamin A very very high

222
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,840
This is 262% of Rixu, which is three times

223
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,000
just too much

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,800
not too much

225
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,140
very many

226
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,980
This one is better than this Potato than sheep feather

227
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,140
Others of course there are many of this

228
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,380
so-called micronutrients

229
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,540
is very important one has

230
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,240
Then if we talk about heat

231
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,880
Sweets and vegetables are not too high

232
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,340
Even with this daily allowance, itâs not too high

233
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,240
So

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,840
What is the production volume of Fangen

235
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,960
if use this

236
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,800
The average beauty is the average

237
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
In terms of production volume

238
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,480
yes

239
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,960
Papua New Guinea

240
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
is the highest

241
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
Solomon D'Or

242
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,880
big bed is

243
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
one hundred sixty seven four

244
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,880
you can tell

245
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,040
No matter what you play, rodless

246
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,840
are higher

247
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,960
not in

248
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,440
beautiful countries

249
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,520
So it can be seen that this is already

250
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,360
new big thing

251
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,760
Useful elsewhere

252
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,360
So

253
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,640
Of course you can also see

254
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,480
these things are

255
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,240
Can't grow rice

256
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,480
A place where wheat cannot be grown

257
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,120
So

258
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,040
now for this

259
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,160
Potatoes

260
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,360
Potatoes

261
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
This Qinghua must be earlier

262
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,240
Evidence from 10,000 years ago

263
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,960
People's species

264
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,420
Of course not a smaller one like this

265
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,780
I haven't seen it either

266
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,580
In 10,000 years, the future is not here

267
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,900
But according to archaeologists

268
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,420
not that big

269
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,900
The Poleto Solanum Tuvarossum

270
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:23,700
The languages ââspoken are very different

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,980
Spanish speaks Pata

272
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,540
It comes from this native language

273
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,480
another kind of speech

274
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,280
Like this Art Appel in Dutch

275
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,440
It's an earthy apple

276
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,140
Another kind of speech is Italian Russian

277
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,440
Shoes

278
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,040
This is the very expensive shiitake mushroom from France.

279
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,480
what is shiitake

280
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,000
I forgot

281
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,800
but anyway

282
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,040
That's it

283
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,040
This Italian uses this

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,440
The Germans are changing it a bit, called Karatover

285
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Germans also use art apple, art is to the apple

286
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,480
Russia also uses this Karatover

287
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,720
French is the same as the local Marlins, potatoes are the same as the Continental

288
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,080
In Ruiyu is Marlins, and Gagaimo

289
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,400
Gagimo is when they brought in

290
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,560
It's Gabba from Sofa, which was called Gagarda back then

291
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,200
so it's called gageimo

292
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:41,520
This Puttlang is also like the French style

293
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,880
It is rented by the old party, and its scope is wider

294
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,560
To remember this soldier and this generation

295
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,960
wars among european countries wars other than climate

296
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,560
So get big

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
However, most of these countries can still grow wheat

298
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Therefore, it is not necessary to rely entirely on this Potato for rescue.

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So they are more manageable

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But Alan

301
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Ailan is the most popular snack for Potato

302
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There is a good reason for this

303
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
makes sense

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We have been to Ireland twice

305
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Then I learned a lot about the history and geography of Ailan

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The geography of Ailan is

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It was hundreds of years ago

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Ailan mainly develops here

309
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This area is better

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
All kinds of things grow faster

311
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
but later

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
british light loveland after

313
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
take the original geography

314
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,600
The man who loves blue comes here

315
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Here is the land is very bad

316
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,300
You can tell from this

317
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,400
This is also the image I made last year

318
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,600
is very convenient

319
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,100
many stones

320
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,600
nothing looks right

321
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,500
Only potatoes can

322
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,700
In order to grow up in this kind of place

323
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,800
so what

324
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,000
Originally the basic thing of the Inca Empire was Potato

325
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,300
And after it spread to Europe in 1570

326
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,100
Ailan is the first to collect money on a large scale

327
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,200
late 16th century

328
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,500
big success

329
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Not very successful

330
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,100
Now they don't have anything to eat

331
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,600
so what

332
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
they succeeded

333
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,500
Able to export to European countries

334
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,300
So the personality is super positive all at once

335
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,200
this

336
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
these decades

337
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,100
Just from five a day

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,460
million to eight million

339
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,540
increase very quickly

340
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,160
The increase is fast, of course there is something wrong

341
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,340
so why is there a problem

342
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,740
Because other crops cannot grow

343
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
only grow potatoes

344
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,140
Then it becomes monocrop

345
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,640
Single crop problems are many

346
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,080
Because disease is easy to come

347
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,280
So get this kind of here is an example

348
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,020
black spot

349
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,880
The disease of potatoes

350
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,920
This disease still exists

351
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,320
not completely wiped out

352
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,280
But then it was the most powerful

353
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Then what

354
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,920
After finding the disease

355
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,780
Then most of the potatoes just fell off.

356
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,820
So make this big famine in Aran

357
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,580
Then what

358
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,020
It can be seen that this very, very powerful hope

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Therefore, the population will decrease greatly after this place exists.

360
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
From this number reduced like this

361
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It is one of the four languages ââof Taiwan

362
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
some are immigrants

363
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
some are dead

364
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So this has a great influence on Ailan

365
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And the result of immigration

366
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It also means that at least two presidents of the United States are pure Irish

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Well, Obama now also says he is one of the eight writers

368
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Or one of the few texts is the Irishman

369
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No matter how many who is one of the few texts

370
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Anyway, this is a big problem

371
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
how to solve this problem

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Later, it was more disease-resistant and disease-resistant from the United States.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,400
Insect-resistant species reintroduction

374
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Only input can solve this problem

375
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,200
It turns out that Mallinson's origin is in

376
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,800
Biru is about the middle of Bolivia

377
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,600
this is very famous

378
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Lake Titicaca

379
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
what about this lake

380
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,100
So it's interesting to say

381
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,400
the people who live in this lake

382
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,200
don't live on land

383
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,300
They took this little grass that grows in the water

384
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,200
How many percent is one meter two meters thick

385
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,100
Then build a house on it and do all kinds of stuff

386
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,700
If the children grow up and want to separate

387
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,000
It's the turf not the soil

388
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
sod cut

389
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
It's a separation

390
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,800
formal separation

391
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,900
what about this

392
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,200
just about

393
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,100
The origin of this potato

394
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,800
So

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,840
A few years ago we went to Match of Pitch

396
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,480
this is very nice

397
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,840
It is said that in these places

398
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,640
Counted more than 2000 people

399
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,140
What do they say is Potato

400
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,280
Mainly Potato

401
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,640
Where is the potato planted?

402
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,240
planted here

403
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,080
I didn't find anything

404
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,980
But the area here is not too big

405
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,340
But it can support 2000 people

406
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,480
is quite productive quite high

407
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,420
Then learn this little biology

408
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,840
say something

409
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,120
place of origin

410
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,840
on average a lot

411
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,720
average less words

412
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,340
For example, the European race

413
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,180
Yes, there are fewer types

414
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,780
Africa is more

415
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,240
Because Africa is native

416
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,380
Potato, Patata, Patata

417
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,720
this can sometimes be confusing

418
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,880
For example, in the early

419
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,080
spanish

420
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,980
or italian

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,560
I often confuse Potato with sheep feathers

422
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,680
But in Cretia are these people

423
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,760
These people in Mordaishu right here in England

424
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,040
Their language is called Cretia

425
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,880
It translates sweet potato as

426
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,280
Bada in Taiwanese

427
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,680
Potato called Bada

428
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,640
So the Spaniards confuse the two powders

429
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,720
Potato

430
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
So early records

431
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,960
You have to be careful

432
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,080
Sometimes they speak Potato

433
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,960
But honestly Sweet Potato

434
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,120
There is also the progress of the above

435
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,040
So

436
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,000
How should Potato be pronounced?

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,080
what about this

438
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,520
I want everyone to listen

439
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,240
Tomato, let's call the old thing off.

440
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,500
I just heard that the famous Armstrong and Inia Fitzgerald

441
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,540
so this is very interesting

442
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:24,420
So it should be Potato, Patata, nothing.

443
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,840
Letâs talk about Potato production

444
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,380
If we talk about medium output, it is usually China

445
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,840
But India and the Soviet Union are pretty good

446
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,880
you'll see later

447
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,120
If we look at it per capita, it is not China

448
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,040
Beyer, Indian Kiss, Russia, Baspeia, Poland, Russia, etc.

449
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Such as Bolivia, Mexico, and France

450
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
very funny

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
but anyway

452
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It can be seen that these countries can accept new crops from the New World

453
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Taiwan too

454
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Look at Yin Yang again

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
do i want to talk

456
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
because everyone knows

457
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Anyway, Poleto is quite silver value

458
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
is quite high

459
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Especially the protein is a little higher than this meal

460
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
There are also various hygienic

461
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Except Sanitin A

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Everything else is pretty good

463
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
words in america

464
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Often eat baked merry meringue

465
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The skin is actually delicious

466
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Its silver price is compared with the whole Poleto

467
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
is also uncomfortable

468
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
the good thing is

469
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's just that the skin is worth more

470
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
This is pretty good in terms of real nutrition

471
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,100
and delicious

472
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,100
have a big problem

473
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,600
that is to say, what I just said

474
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,900
we may not have talked

475
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,600
Grape fruit can be produced for a long time

476
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
several months

477
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,100
sometimes you see it sprout

478
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,300
If it sprouts, it's best to throw it away

479
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,600
Because after germination, there is this

480
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,400
Solan Lin

481
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
nongine

482
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,800
it's poisonous

483
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,000
So in the past, grapes were more expensive

484
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,100
you just cut it off

485
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,800
but still not sure

486
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,000
so grape fruit is very cheap now

487
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,900
so you can farm

488
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,700
Don't go for surgery again

489
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:55,100
then the question

490
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,900
I'm not a doctor either

491
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,400
But that's a lot of problems

492
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,600
If the method of serious illness will be lost

493
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,800
So this is a big disadvantage

494
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,900
So what about the aborigines?

495
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,200
How to deal with marinsu for storage

496
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,900
It has a thing called Tunno

497
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,400
this thing is wonderful

498
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Because Potato is mainly in

499
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,000
place of the anders plateau

500
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,200
it is very hot during the day

501
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,600
it's cold at night

502
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,900
So put the potato out

503
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,300
freeze it

504
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,500
Then step on it during the day

505
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,300
just roll out the water

506
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,100
If you do this kind of work for two or three days

507
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,000
Become a Tunno

508
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,300
This is this small piece of Potato that was originally a relatively large piece

509
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,700
After doing this, it is a natural biscuit

510
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,000
later can

511
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,400
It is said that the two or three years of early spring collection

512
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,760
And after soaking in water

513
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,840
still quite tasty

514
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
I haven't been out, I've seen

515
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,040
So if sweet vegetables are compared with potatoes

516
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,720
Everyone knows this

517
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,000
Sweets and vegetables prefer to be wet

518
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,640
clear weather

519
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
not potatoes

520
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,040
As long as it contains energy

521
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,800
then just saw

522
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,400
Ye Qing can

523
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,000
I also saw that the leaf buds are poisonous

524
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Sweets and Vegetables Compared to Potatoes

525
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's just Jiuchun

526
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,600
this can last a long time

527
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
It's fine for a few months

528
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,000
inverse value method

529
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,400
Sweets and Vegetables are Nakato

530
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,800
I've hit it several times

531
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,000
When i was young

532
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,600
This is Nakato faster

533
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Sweets and vegetables are not less

534
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,600
Because it crawls on the ground very quickly

535
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,000
so can't let

536
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,640
This weed grows out

537
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,800
Malinsu needs Ecstasy longifolia

538
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,140
I have already said that Vitamin A is higher

539
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,640
so often

540
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,140
Crop efficiency is compared in terms of heat

541
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,440
So the sweet potato marinsu just mentioned

542
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,540
We didn't even talk about rice taro

543
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,100
This is not from the Protestants

544
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,040
neither taro nor pony

545
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,400
but do this

546
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,740
Just watch this first

547
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,040
This statistic averages eight years

548
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,600
Statistics made by Japanese agricultural students

549
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
what about sweet potatoes

550
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,940
The heat generated by ten projects is so much

551
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,340
What about Malinsu?

552
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,800
A bit lower but pretty good

553
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,740
So it's lower

554
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,000
but to understand

555
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,800
Rice planting in Japan can only be done for one period

556
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,640
In Taiwan, there are two phases and three phases

557
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It should be a little more than this

558
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But anyway, this sweet potato

559
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
When this caloric standpoint

560
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It is the most efficient of this crop

561
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Wheat is better than this universe

562
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Now let's talk about this corn

563
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Pan wheat

564
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
In the United States, English is often spoken in Korn

565
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Korn isn't actually a good name for this corn

566
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Korn originally means small particles in English

567
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
so what

568
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Is it right that this corn is called Korn

569
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
in other countries

570
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
It's the same English-speaking British word.

571
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
They use Maze

572
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
This is from the scientific name

573
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The scientific name also comes from here

574
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So Zia Maze

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,400
This corn was also fumigated many years ago

576
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,160
So now you can see many kinds of

577
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,920
Three or four years ago when I went

578
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,160
The ones they most often come up with are shorter

579
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,560
Not enough corn with large grains

580
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,800
came out very tasty

581
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,880
So now that's a lot

582
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,640
But also see many kinds of

583
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,600
there is a disadvantage

584
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,800
because there is a shortcoming

585
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,520
is it missing something

586
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,160
The first one is Vitamin B3

587
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,760
This is called Ni-Syn

588
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,640
No-Syn

589
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,600
this thing should be

590
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,240
Use alkaline water to get the oil out

591
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,120
without this

592
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,840
This Pelagra can happen again

593
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,960
this is lack

594
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,900
That is, weight loss and physical strength will decrease

595
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:10,400
In addition, cut less chestnut acid and sian acid in the corn

596
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,100
this is very important

597
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:22,600
But fortunately, you can supplement these two amino acids by eating beans

598
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,000
Finally, we will talk about beans from the New World.

599
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,900
like going to a mexican restaurant

600
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,500
You often see beans come out with corn

601
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,000
all make sense

602
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We talked about the word waxy

603
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,700
Everyone likes glutinous rice, and also likes brown rice

604
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,700
So, does glutinous rice have glutinous rice?

605
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,000
yes, where

606
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,480
There was once a time when Nuo corn was discovered in mainland China

607
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,520
So China's Scientology is very happy

608
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,880
we also have the origin of corn

609
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:22,160
But then I realized it wasn't

610
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,000
But let's talk about Nomi Chaomi first

611
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,280
I'll tell you a little deeper knowledge

612
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,520
This is the test of knowledge

613
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,920
So you should try this

614
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,160
some people

615
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,760
I should talk about this first

616
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,320
There are many experts here

617
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,000
I'm really taking the liberty to say these things

618
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,400
But I'm more of an expert on this

619
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,800
So obsessive electric mixer is like this

620
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,880
So the obsessed electric mixer is like this

621
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,280
This is called Amylose Amylopectin like this

622
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,320
then the year does matter

623
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,920
It's probably conceivable

624
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,240
it is very sticky

625
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,240
It's not sticky and simple

626
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,240
Therefore, there are fewer obsessive electric lines in glutinous rice

627
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,940
Aminopectin

628
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,040
There are many, many electric lines of obsession

629
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,340
so normal this

630
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,640
It is usually in the case of brown rice

631
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,240
mostly

632
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,240
Most of them are electric lines of obsession

633
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,940
Then the electric lines of obsession are less

634
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,940
The glutinous rice just mentioned is now

635
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,540
Although originally discovered in China

636
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,740
but already

637
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,040
Glutinous rice goes to America

638
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,340
Now almost the world's

639
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,040
The so-called glutinous rice electric pattern is

640
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,740
so-called glutinous rice

641
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:59,040
Well this has been said and dance

642
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
by the way

643
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,840
Let me tell you about the glycemic index

644
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,960
You can't talk about calories in food

645
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,740
It also depends on how the heat is absorbed by ourselves

646
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,720
some

647
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,000
our reason

648
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,240
blood sugar rises rapidly

649
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,560
speak slowly

650
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
some

651
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,400
just increase slowly

652
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,200
And you can't use this weight to calculate

653
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,920
So you should use this glycemic index to see

654
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,280
Well of course I won't go into details

655
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,080
but

656
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,800
White rice and grass rice

657
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,440
You can see it by comparing

658
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,560
some things are the same

659
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,680
total calories are the same

660
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,680
The glycemic index is so different

661
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,560
so what

662
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,760
The tallest is French bread

663
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,680
Baguette is the highest

664
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So people who like to eat French bread be careful

665
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I wonât talk about it, I donât want to talk about it, you read a lot of such records on the Internet

666
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Then the third thing I want to talk about is the so-called Banyok

667
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Banyok is probably Cassava in Taiwan.

668
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yoga, or yoga is the same

669
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Cassava is æ¨è¯ãæ¨¹è¯

670
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Our common ones are potato flour or Taipei flour.

671
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
In fact, the glutinous rice just mentioned is often mixed to make Taipei flour.

672
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
But because it becomes very sticky after heating it up a little

673
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
this is taipei powder

674
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
So the glutinous rice just mentioned is also Taipei flour.

675
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It is also the third largest crop in the world

676
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Mainly not in the US

677
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
and mainly in Africa

678
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Tapioca that can be mainly seen now

679
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
There is a spherical Tapioca

680
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Making Tapioca Balls

681
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
i don't have time to talk

682
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
what to say later

683
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
wait a minute i will talk too

684
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Also by Tapioca

685
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
There is also Tapioca made into balls

686
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I have already mentioned

687
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Counting Electric Soul

688
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The quality electric soul is a little more

689
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So would be able to make this

690
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
good

691
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So

692
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
This thing Tapioca also has toxins

693
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Also inside the rooting or quick-rooting bark

694
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
glycoside

695
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Green acid is

696
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
when everyone wants to commit suicide

697
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
just eat this

698
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
But I didn't finish half of what I just said.

699
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That is to say, this Tapioca is very important in Africa

700
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
The main reason is that those places in Africa do not have enough water

701
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
You can't grow sweet potatoes, but you can grow them

702
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
but not too successful

703
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Then grow this Tapioca

704
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
The local people of the Tapioca people are very active

705
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So it can't wait to dig out the root and eat it

706
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
so the problem is big

707
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
The problem is that it's not mature enough to take root

708
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It just doesn't grow roots

709
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It is the unripe root, the root block

710
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
After eating it, it will produce green acid

711
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Anyone who knows a little chemistry can see that

712
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
This is the source of cyanic acid

713
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
this is a big problem

714
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
then we will soon

715
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
is there any time here

716
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
time comparison

717
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Tomato

718
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Tomato is another Solannam

719
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I bind the peril

720
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Ligo is

721
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Long

722
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Pericum is peach

723
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Tao

724
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This is from

725
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Mexico B. Lu Gaudi

726
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
This should read B

727
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
this country

728
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
before

729
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Once became B Lu by himself

730
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Not Peru

731
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This is

732
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
marjoram

733
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
go to the philippines

734
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Then what

735
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Just isolate

736
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
spread very fast

737
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
imagine this now

738
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
to an italian restaurant

739
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
no escape

740
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Before going to the museum

741
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
not italian

742
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
often in usa

743
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
work

744
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The question is, is it a fruit or a vegetable?

745
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Both fruits and vegetables are good and nutritious

746
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
so what is

747
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So this is from Tomato

748
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
the origin of this phrase

749
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Asthex is called Citomato

750
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
What about the rest of Central America?

751
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Just get rid of this first Ciraba

752
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Screaming Tomato

753
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Then when you go to Australia or Italy?

754
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
don't use this

755
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's called Pomodoro

756
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Pomo means Apple

757
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Doro is gold

758
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
golden apple

759
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Then the discourse is called Pom de Moll

760
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
What about this? Actually, if you say

761
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
If it is directly released, it is the apple of love

762
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But it has nothing to do with love

763
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
you love

764
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Ask someone to eat this apple and it won't love you more

765
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It is said that the document I read recently said this

766
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
This one originally meant this Pom de Mour

767
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
It's the Mu'er people, the people in northern Africa.

768
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
What about these people, just call this eggplant this

769
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
France is anti-made this called Pom de Mour

770
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So don't give your lover too much Tomato

771
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
what about when i go somewhere else

772
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
only see this thing

773
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
tomato on tree

774
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Then Taiwan also has

775
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
not native is there

776
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
yes yes

777
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So this thing is

778
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Actually, it's the tomato tree

779
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I ate several of them and they were pretty good, just like the usual fairy tales

780
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Well, of course, the ingredients in the tomato are only quite good, that is, the soup is a little less

781
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The water side is also a little less, but the taste is quite high

782
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And this is the medium production of China, the United States, Turkey, India, etc.

783
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
In terms of crowds, these numbers are different

784
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
However, the most important source of use in tomatoes is a product, which is lycopene

785
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It is a major anti-oxygen antioxidant

786
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Then also the predecessor of this carotenoid

787
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So, Tomato is a tomato that has quite a different value

788
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
We don't need to talk about this anymore

789
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,600
What I want to tell you is

790
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,800
Holidays can leave the release of Tomato Flavor Elements

791
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Then look at the next one

792
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
But this first

793
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
one

794
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,000
Interjection is to say that the United States is said

795
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If your dog is sprayed by this shy boy

796
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
it stinks very stinky

797
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Can't be washed off with flying photos

798
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
so what to do

799
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
They just say use this

800
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
tomato

801
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Tomato Juice to wash

802
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Because of the lake bottle thing

803
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
is polyunsaturated

804
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,480
It's hard to live

805
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,680
So the smelly thing it sprays out is called

806
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,880
Milk Captain

807
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,840
So it can be quickly absorbed by this hair

808
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,480
But let's be honest

809
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,080
You don't have to commit a crime when you take your dog out in the wild

810
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,880
guilty and beside

811
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,080
so to be honest

812
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,960
So it's better to fight with small trees

813
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,120
Add this peroxide core

814
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,480
Then it will be fine after oxidation.

815
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
good

816
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,600
Well, half of what I just said

817
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,640
It is only when Lycopin is heated that it can be released

818
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,760
This is when there is no heat

819
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,160
It becomes brighter after heating

820
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,760
So after heating it releases

821
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,080
Then there is a simultaneous experiment

822
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,560
Do Vitamin C Thoroughly

823
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:09,740
Vitamin C is not as fragile as everyone thinks

824
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:16,380
It goes through 80 degrees is 30 minutes at least -1

825
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,940
20 percent only

826
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,760
So it doesn't hurt too much

827
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,600
However, during this period, the Lai Kepin has increased a lot

828
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:33,540
The function of this Lai Kepin is quite good

829
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,400
Mainly sunscreen

830
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:44,540
And its active strength is 10 times stronger than Vitamin E

831
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,380
Twice as much as Kyler's Note so pretty good

832
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,240
So love or not, you can eat more of this

833
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,260
ease

834
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,900
Well, maybe you think this

835
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,260
Catchup is used

836
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,000
In kyogen, the word looks like this

837
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,200
right

838
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,200
This is the catchup could be this

839
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,300
then come back

840
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,200
Peanuts

841
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,100
occur

842
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:26,000
I prefer to fall

843
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
the intention to lose it when it happens

844
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,700
Ditto is ok

845
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,700
Longevity Fruit Too Severe and Deep Imperial Physician

846
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,500
The imperial doctor's dirt bucket and wide bucket can do it

847
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
In Japanese it is called Tang Ren Dou

848
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,000
Nanjing bucket

849
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
is to indicate its source

850
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,600
it is imported from china

851
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,900
That's why it's called Tangrendou

852
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:50,700
Nanjing bucket

853
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,400
Then look at this seed

854
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,400
The production volume is still China's No. 1 in India, etc., etc.

855
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,800
so

856
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,340
In fact, Taiwanese pronunciation is quite natural.

857
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,360
more vocal than other countries

858
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,860
i think so

859
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:17,480
The spoken word is also

860
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,320
Spaniards are closer to earthfish

861
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,980
like chili

862
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,280
it's still called chili

863
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,480
Spain is called Wette

864
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,720
Germany is called Archnus

865
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,520
bean of soil

866
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,420
Of course it doesn't make sense for me to mention this

867
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,760
with italian etc.

868
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,960
German and Dutch etc are two systems

869
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,560
whatever you call it

870
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,880
vocalization is very

871
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,720
very high volume

872
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,180
Where is the height?

873
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:59,380
Because the heat is not too high

874
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,960
The heat of the fire rice comes from the main body and from the main yellow

875
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:05,920
Soup is not high

876
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,620
1,000 yuan for a pig is a bit higher

877
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,080
then the protein is very high

878
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,320
And this one has very, very high offshore acid

879
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,460
So you eat corn best with

880
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,660
peanuts to cultivate

881
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,500
So you can make up this offshore acid

882
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,000
Then these various

883
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,360
it is enough

884
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,200
So let's talk about this

885
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,460
Fanshiliu

886
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,460
guava

887
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,660
what about this

888
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,000
its origin is not clear

889
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,920
Because very early on it was

890
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,200
probably from

891
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,000
Into the Americas from southern Mexico

892
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Then what

893
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,500
the entire interior of the Americas

894
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,700
with the West Indies, etc.

895
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,660
islands are

896
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,160
Guo Lunbu hasn't entered yet

897
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,700
It has spread a little bit before reaching the U.S.

898
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,800
then of course

899
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,200
maybe not later

900
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,100
spread more widely

901
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,200
So

902
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,400
This is Spread Before Columbus

903
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,900
then this

904
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,900
this

905
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,400
What about Leo's name?

906
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:24,600
Celium Guajaba

907
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,600
Reflected in Spanish

908
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,700
spanish french

909
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,900
All use this Guajaba

910
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,100
GU A-Handle-Hanging Art

911
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,200
wait wait wait wait

912
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,400
So why is Taiwan called Bala?

913
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,200
I don't have this yet

914
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,900
full of explanations

915
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,000
The advanced possibilities of everyone here

916
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,600
will teach me

917
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,600
why this

918
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,400
Bala in Taiwan

919
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,800
where did i come from

920
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,500
So the world's

921
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,800
None of this

922
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,500
The difference is

923
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,900
Abbas of Guam

924
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,500
it's quite different

925
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,000
Nothing like this one in Bala

926
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
the noun

927
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,500
good

928
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Look at its nutritional value

929
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,500
not too hot

930
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,000
The wind is not too high

931
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
fiber is a lot

932
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But the microphone is also quite impressive

933
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,500
A wide variety of sanitation is good

934
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,000
But the best thing is

935
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,500
Bitem is very high

936
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,500
So

937
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,000
Plus things like Baili

938
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,500
It is said

939
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
According to this document

940
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
is very functional

941
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
that's what they say

942
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,500
common sense barra can lower

943
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
type 2 diabetes

944
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,500
So Taiwan has four seasons

945
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,500
All produce this Fanshiliu

946
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
output is large

947
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,500
According to my guess, there are few in the whole country

948
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,500
so what

949
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,500
All Barra water is good

950
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,500
also have problems

951
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
But needless to say

952
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,380
Well, I've probably already said this

953
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,880
One thing I also pointed out is that

954
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,360
Way stream leaves are also very useful

955
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,120
It's probably not like before when we went to the country when we were kids

956
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:26,720
He sees this way the leaves that flow into tea attack women

957
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,600
So this is a very generous kind of thing

958
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,760
I probably don't have such a good thing now

959
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,760
This can be seen look at this

960
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,760
Bai Lamin is one person equal to three oranges

961
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,360
Sometimes three oranges are too much to eat

962
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:50,160
Then just eat one and eat one spicy enough

963
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,720
Talk about this square sauce chili

964
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,480
Chili is also eaten quite early

965
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It turned out that the remixing started in Beijing

966
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
it was in the southwest

967
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It is said so

968
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
The ship also passes through the Philippines and India

969
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Then in China, Indonesia, Korea, Japan

970
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The engineering department also brought directly to Spain, Fortaur

971
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
This pepper can be divided into three types

972
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Green Peppers, Chili Peppers, Chili Peppers

973
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
The reason for this spiciness is a substance called capsaicin

974
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
capsaicin

975
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
This is actually in medicine now

976
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
You can also use this

977
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
When doing this various medicine

978
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
There must be several doctors who can confirm this

979
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
have a good one

980
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
there are birds

981
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
just lacking on this chili

982
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
But the birds are not spicy when they eat these things

983
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Of course it doesn't matter

984
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
why i don't know

985
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I don't know why there is any advantage

986
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,440
Beef is not spicy

987
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,640
then the next thing is very interesting

988
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,880
And the story of its origin goes like this

989
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,600
Not a soil genus for a deficiency

990
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,480
then you can also see

991
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,680
It's not easy for mortals to fall in love

992
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,080
But the princess fell in love with this handsome

993
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,000
Of course the one who falls in love must be handsome

994
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,840
Probably not feed it Tomato

995
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,200
Then this pair of relatives escaped from their father's arrest

996
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,400
This is often a myth or an old story

997
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,040
This is very cruel

998
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,040
they were arrested inside tropical sage

999
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,840
And be beheaded

1000
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,640
this is very cruel

1001
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,760
Then their seats stay on the ground

1002
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,120
become this thing

1003
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
This is Vanilla's story

1004
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
This is where Vanilla comes from

1005
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
There are of course stories like this everywhere.

1006
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
This is a story of Vanilla

1007
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Vanilla's wind walk is also a bit weird

1008
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Because it's not China anymore

1009
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
not america

1010
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Vanilla is a country

1011
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
China also has it, but I have big ideas

1012
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Mexico etc.

1013
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Because what Vanilla found was a French doctor

1014
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
French doctors later transplanted him to

1015
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
an island in a certain french pavilion

1016
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
later planted

1017
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
The plant is growing

1018
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But it won't be able to receive

1019
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I said that Vanilla just talked about it

1020
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
The things I saw just now can't grow

1021
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
later they found out

1022
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
One of their efforts compared to a very smart effort

1023
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
i think he found out

1024
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
because there is no

1025
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:28,000
There is no certain wind to medium this hair powder

1026
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Later this clever effort

1027
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
invented this so-called artificial pollination method

1028
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
To be able to deliver this vanilla up

1029
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
able to be strong

1030
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So he won't be the one you normally see

1031
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Compared with the crispy corn, there are more residual crispy

1032
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
then this i like very much

1033
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I ask the source of this corn

1034
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
What about the term Vanilla?

1035
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,920
It was only in 1989 that there was this Barneyland

1036
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,480
This is from Barneyland

1037
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,680
Baccarat

1038
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,200
latin is parnylan

1039
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,280
It's Xiaolizi

1040
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,280
One very important thing is

1041
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,120
Flavor after fermentation

1042
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,320
there is no way you put it there

1043
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,640
It must be treated in some way to have a scent

1044
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,920
what's inside benylon

1045
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,200
There is a direction, this join has fermentation technology

1046
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,760
can see this

1047
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,400
Pippi and Marilyn

1048
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,280
Marilyn sometimes this is called a candy

1049
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:40,880
so what

1050
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,840
These two are the most important direction components

1051
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,840
So

1052
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,160
So now about this chocolate

1053
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,040
chocolate

1054
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,840
chocolate this

1055
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,720
This number is called

1056
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,280
Til Brown Mocha High

1057
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,120
Thiel is a god

1058
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,080
Bronmore is food

1059
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,160
water of god

1060
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
In fact, they often eat this chocolate in the king of aspen juice, for example.

1061
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
he doesn't eat this chocolate

1062
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
They eat the thick jelly of this tissue

1063
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
This is about 1100

1064
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Said relatively new discovery

1065
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
It was produced by China and the United States

1066
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
here are black and white chocolate

1067
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
White chocolate is not real chocolate

1068
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
why

1069
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
because it is not without this chocolate

1070
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
what i told you just now

1071
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:57,000
so chocolate has several things

1072
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
so very important

1073
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,480
this is the most important

1074
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,020
Fanel et alamin

1075
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,520
Fanis

1076
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,520
This thing is a neural address

1077
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,080
This means you feel good and comfortable after eating it

1078
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,200
so you don't have to send this tomato

1079
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,840
send some chocolate

1080
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,840
There is also this Theodore Bramins

1081
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,320
This is very similar to caffeine

1082
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,960
The difference is this place

1083
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,400
There is this clip machine in the coffee

1084
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,320
not here

1085
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,680
It's not important that its function is almost the same

1086
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,960
So white chocolate doesn't have those things

1087
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,920
So your white chocolate is free

1088
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,240
Not only free gift but also harm

1089
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,040
why do harm

1090
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,480
Because it contains Coconut Butter

1091
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,260
cheese

1092
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,920
Fukalabada is all about saturated food

1093
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,960
too many nights

1094
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,960
so you send white chocolate

1095
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,260
just want your lover to be early

1096
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,500
having a heart attack etc.

1097
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,040
So give me a dark chocolate set

1098
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
Let's talk about beans

1099
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:28,200
Beans Actually Every Week in New World Beans

1100
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,880
are more expensive than the rule of law in Russia

1101
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,040
lots and lots of beans

1102
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,600
Among them, there are many kinds of Taiwan

1103
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:44,880
For example, the rule of law Russia we call Kidney Bean

1104
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,680
Yellow Ground Bean Lemabini

1105
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,840
Lema is actually a

1106
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,840
In picture one is about the emperor

1107
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,620
Inge also means emperor

1108
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:00,620
So this is what Emperor Bean means

1109
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,540
It's all against

1110
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,340
So this is a lot of land

1111
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:07,420
Many other beans are freshly poured in

1112
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,960
so i just said

1113
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:13,320
If you eat corn, you must supplement it with beans.

1114
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,640
In other words, you only need ten items on nutrition.

1115
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:23,040
Finally I talk about these plants

1116
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,160
I'll start by telling you about the Fromosa Plants

1117
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,220
It was written by the priest Mr. Pan Fujun

1118
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:36,360
This sign is inserted from his book

1119
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:41,220
Well, what happened to the corn turned the book, actually I already talked about it

1120
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,000
sleep

1121
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,360
Probably none of you didn't expect that you brought it to America with your own hands.

1122
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,920
papaya is also pineapple

1123
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,740
I thought the pineapple was from Taiwan but it wasn't

1124
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,060
Pumpkin is not Freddie and certainly not cassava and neither

1125
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:58,620
Passion fruit is not strawberry nor is it

1126
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,160
look at its orchid garden

1127
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,880
In the early days, most of them passed through the Philippines

1128
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,480
Of course it's not that simple

1129
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,320
But whenever we see, for example,

1130
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,040
also through the Philippines

1131
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,240
It may also come via the mainland

1132
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,160
Everything that comes from sleep is pretended

1133
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,080
Then papaya and so on are all troubles

1134
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,240
Closer means

1135
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:28,960
The genus is from Brazil through the South Island of Southeast Asia

1136
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,320
Baixiang fruit is brought by the Japanese

1137
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,840
Strawberries are also brought by the Japanese

1138
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,200
But of course it's originally from the New World.

1139
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,680
so far we have only talked about plants

1140
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,400
We are not partial to plants

1141
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:54,080
But because most of the things from the New World

1142
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,760
more plants

1143
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,240
Then you think about what kind of New World

1144
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,160
This animal can attack the Old World

1145
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,360
including Taiwan

1146
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,360
can you name a few

1147
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,520
but food

1148
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,520
So animals don't move much food over there

1149
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,520
this

1150
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,520
This is also quite

1151
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,520
This is Shenzhen, a native of the United States

1152
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,520
Now there's this wildfire machine

1153
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,520
Of course, now is the time for the so-called temperature-sensitive world

1154
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,520
is a lot

1155
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,520
then this

1156
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,520
how come

1157
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,760
The other is overturning

1158
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:08,040
This is me a few months ago half a year ago

1159
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,880
Overturned photos taken outside Ulu

1160
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,800
They still have pressure

1161
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:17,480
I don't quite understand that winter progresses

1162
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,200
I can't think of anything to do with this

1163
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,400
It's weird to appear on the stage

1164
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,600
why i don't know

1165
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,800
Then only in this

1166
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,280
I experienced it myself

1167
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,160
Sauce duck, honey duck, etc.

1168
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,840
So these two birds

1169
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,800
just compare

1170
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:44,480
animal that produces more food

1171
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,640
per continent per continent

1172
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,880
never looked like a cow

1173
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,480
Or animals like pigs don't have

1174
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,280
this is for many reasons

1175
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,200
I don't have time to talk about that now

1176
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
some are some

1177
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
then this is not food

1178
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,000
But there is a very influential thing is tobacco

1179
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I'll talk about this before I talk about tobacco

1180
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Solanan

1181
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
A lot of this pig in this family is food

1182
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So is Gou Ji

1183
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Tobacco Of course many of these things belong to Solanan

1184
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Tobacco belongs to this too

1185
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Then everyone knows Nicotin

1186
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,000
The impact of this tobacco is not only on Taiwan

1187
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Great influence all over the world

1188
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
not food

1189
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But the biggest impact

1190
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
then when we were kids

1191
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
We went to learn that the digital product of Taiwan's main business is ABCSR

1192
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
very different now

1193
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
A is for anana

1194
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
This is Pineapple

1195
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
dividend

1196
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
B is of course banana

1197
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
C is for elder

1198
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Campfer

1199
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
S is of course sugar

1200
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
R is for rice

1201
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
T

1202
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
different now

1203
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
C may be computer

1204
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Everyone didn't know for a while

1205
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Anyway, this is very different from now

1206
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So

1207
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
girls dating

1208
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
We Colombus

1209
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
provide us with many things

1210
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So what's coming back in Asia

1211
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
First

1212
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
The big thing is soybeans

1213
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Soybeans are very very very high impact

1214
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
The other one is the duck

1215
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Then I won't talk about the other one now

1216
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'll talk about it later

1217
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
So let's talk about soybeans first

1218
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
soybeans sleeping in england

1219
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,120
Suo Yabing

1220
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,720
then in

1221
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,920
America is Suo Yibing

1222
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,200
soya ice

1223
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,400
in japanese

1224
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,920
soy sauce is called soy sauce

1225
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,720
so what about this

1226
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:14,400
from

1227
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,520
Soya ice comes from soy sauce

1228
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,360
then the United States

1229
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,200
The United States likes to put some things

1230
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:21,720
shorten

1231
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:22,520
simplify

1232
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,200
Suo Yibing

1233
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,720
what about soybeans

1234
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,520
Of course you can make tofu

1235
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,480
Soy sauce is also doing very well in the United States now

1236
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,200
Soybean oil

1237
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,320
Natto

1238
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,000
No

1239
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:36,080
Natto everyone is also very popular in Taiwan

1240
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,360
often do things

1241
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,480
then there is soy sauce

1242
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,960
So very popular in America

1243
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,480
Elamame means

1244
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,600
that is

1245
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,120
It's written in Japanese

1246
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:47,720
soy beans

1247
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,280
So

1248
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,480
hygienic soup

1249
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,920
Sanitary soup this time

1250
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,240
then this is

1251
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,440
China passes through the UK

1252
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,680
to the United States

1253
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,920
Then soybean production

1254
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
America is thirty-five percent

1255
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
brazil is twenty seven

1256
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
argentina is nineteen

1257
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
China is less

1258
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
so what

1259
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
this is an asian

1260
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
non into columbus one

1261
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
elephant

1262
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So

1263
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Of course this

1264
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Then tell another

1265
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
that is

1266
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
peking duck

1267
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
in the US is called

1268
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Nagashima duck

1269
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
in America

1270
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
duck just compare

1271
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
the small one

1272
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
salary increase industry

1273
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
but

1274
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Every year there are so many

1275
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
of

1276
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
chicken and turkey

1277
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Well, there are fewer ducks

1278
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
but

1279
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The main thing is more than 90 percent

1280
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
it's long island duck

1281
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Long Island is Long Island

1282
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
New York

1283
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
like nearby

1284
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,800
looks like this

1285
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,900
It's exactly the same in Beijing

1286
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,120
So in fact someone said yes

1287
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,960
The Tang Island tooth in the United States is better than that in Beijing, China

1288
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,760
possible

1289
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:18,160
So this is about this tooth seed again

1290
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,000
Yazi Beijing Ya is not actually Beijing

1291
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Check it out

1292
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,960
it is nanjing tooth

1293
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,320
So there is a story

1294
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,520
Anyway, Beijing Dental

1295
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,280
After Nanjing Teeth became Beijing Teeth

1296
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:41,400
It was only in the hands of the Americans in the 1973 era

1297
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,240
Seven Beijing teeth go to the United States

1298
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:49,400
In the future, it will become a lot of output

1299
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:53,880
A chicken with more teeth than a turkey

1300
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,880
However, there are quite a lot of Beijing dental

1301
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,400
So

1302
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,500
Peking duck was originally Nanjing duck

1303
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,400
Later, when the five generations of fruit were opened

1304
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,000
There is this river between Beijing and Nanjing

1305
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,500
often up and down

1306
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:16,000
At that time, Nanjing Duck gradually became Peking Duck

1307
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,600
then look again

1308
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,300
What about the cross mark cross mark cross mark I just mentioned?

1309
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,000
is this majestic

1310
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,200
Don is the tobacco we can say is given to us every week

1311
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,900
asian give them hall

1312
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,200
It feels like this hall

1313
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,000
The language of this church is English and it is called Sugar

1314
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,500
Sugar

1315
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,800
Arabia is that this is Sugar from Arabia

1316
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,100
This is Boss Sugar

1317
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:51,000
Sugar from Indo to Sanskritito

1318
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So now it's Sugar

1319
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,500
Italy in Sugar

1320
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:57,700
Budayain

1321
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,500
In ancient times

1322
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,000
Ancient West

1323
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
The other one is also Saccharis

1324
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
So mostly through this kind of words

1325
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,000
In this Tang character, it is said that the rice character adds soup

1326
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
is a fresh word

1327
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
what about this

1328
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
In fact, Tang has a long history

1329
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Indian record

1330
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
it is south of india with this pole

1331
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
then as far back as 8 centuries before the park

1332
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Well, there are also records in China

1333
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Just said it was from India

1334
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
so don't get close

1335
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
was found before the Gupda dynasty

1336
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It was the park 50 years ago

1337
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Don's proximity is very important

1338
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Before World War II After World War II

1339
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Taiwan's so-called governance of the Tang Dynasty

1340
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
nearly destroyed

1341
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
then reply

1342
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,240
The biggest difficulty is getting this sugar in and out

1343
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,160
If the sugar does not come in and out

1344
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,200
Zhichang is very, very difficult

1345
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,680
just can't count

1346
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:15,480
So whoever can access the sugar person's company first wins

1347
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,760
So there are many economic

1348
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,920
This is not the original

1349
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,040
Okay so now when it comes to this

1350
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,400
During the Halsian Empire of North India

1351
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:33,160
there used to be this pie

1352
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,160
It's time to receive Changchao

1353
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:39,480
can learn this simple method

1354
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,640
i also see

1355
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:45,400
a certain minister of a certain dynasty

1356
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,080
to murder the emperor

1357
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,880
He gave him this candy every day

1358
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,600
He will probably eat later

1359
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,080
Of course it will become

1360
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,160
Is this minister small?

1361
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
What I read about diabetes

1362
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Or just stumbled across this thing I don't know

1363
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Anyway, there have been people who used sugar for reading a long time ago.

1364
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
So

1365
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Bactonia, this is the so-called Great Alexander

1366
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:30,000
When the third land once made an expedition to India

1367
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Just take these and this file is called Honey bearing weas

1368
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It's not this file, it's sugar cane to bring back

1369
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Breed in Mattonia

1370
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Well Columbus is from Kennedy Island

1371
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Got sugarcane weave not brought into the US

1372
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It sounds like Columbus is here

1373
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
something to do with the queen here

1374
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
this relationship

1375
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I won't talk much

1376
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
so it goes through here to get dry

1377
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
In order to be able to grow dry in the United States

1378
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
so we'll get to this

1379
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
FDN in the United States recommends daily

1380
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Get out this 2000 to 2500 calories

1381
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
in the United States actually

1382
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
calories out per day

1383
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
much more than this

1384
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
For example, Cinnabon

1385
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Everyone's little Cinabon in the lot

1386
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
American airports sell this

1387
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
As soon as a Cinabon comes out, this is equal to

1388
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
123% of this stuff

1389
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
a big bottle of cola

1390
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
it's about the same

1391
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Then there are so many Sherups in Pancake

1392
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
ice cream 1 coffee has so much

1393
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
so what

1394
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,400
These things are very, very common to Americans

1395
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:10,680
So FDS is now recommended

1396
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,160
can only eat so much

1397
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,720
So the sugar community is too big

1398
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,640
Everyone Knows To Be Fat

1399
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,840
diabetes patient

1400
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,480
Also cures cancer, stops teeth and hurts liver

1401
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:31,480
These are all very serious consequences

1402
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,800
Recently, Americans have become more self-conscious

1403
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:39,320
There was a doctor called Rovartalustic

1404
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,600
It is the authority of the neurology of internal administration in the United States

1405
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,960
he once published a

1406
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,120
Sugar The Beta Truth

1407
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,880
Very Familiar Facts About Sugar

1408
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,120
That's what he said

1409
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,800
sugar is toxin

1410
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,440
really makes sense

1411
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,880
So you see now America

1412
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:09,440
Every time I come back to the U.S. from a foreign country

1413
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,280
The first thing I can see is the return of the Americans

1414
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,840
it's very scary

1415
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:21,840
So it makes sense for him, the doctor, to say that Down's family read books.

1416
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:28,040
So try your best to use this as your goal

1417
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,040
This is actually a difference between men and women

1418
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,320
But anyway this

1419
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:38,680
If you think about it, one Monday exceeds the calories of the whole day

1420
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:42,720
so very very powerful

1421
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:49,240
So look back at the short history

1422
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:53,680
Then it is the same as below

1423
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,080
It is said that Zhenghe has also been to America, probably not

1424
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,080
But if he comes

1425
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
However, in America, Columbus was not so glorious

1426
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
However, Columbus came to the United States on the 41st, 4th, 9th, 2nd

1427
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Finally, one or two years

1428
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Exactly, I came to Taiwan a little later

1429
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Japan came to Taiwan later

1430
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Therefore, after the actual arrival in the United States,

1431
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
The so-called topic I'm going to talk about today will be quite different.

1432
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
then, at the end

1433
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That's about the end of what I'm talking about

1434
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
However, in the end, I would like to thank you all

1435
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
There are a few people who can help

1436
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
some people are here

1437
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So, what about reference hazards

1438
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
in english, yes

1439
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
why we eat why we eat

1440
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
why we eat why we eat

1441
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,560
starter chocolate

1442
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:04,560
food america to the world

1443
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,400
Also food in history

1444
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:10,640
This is Lie Yi Tae Xia

1445
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,360
It can be said that Qiao Wen has the most Qiao Wen's book is this

1446
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,560
Written by Zugman

1447
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,840
This 1998 is the time when it was published

1448
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,840
the original was earlier

1449
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,640
Potato

1450
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,840
How the humble spot

1451
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,240
spot is the thing that goes fast

1452
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,800
Rescue the western world

1453
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,800
relatively new is

1454
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,080
Andrew Smith's Potato a global history

1455
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,480
I read all these books

1456
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,920
see all

1457
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,840
Then I just talked about this

1458
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,360
Written by Mr. Pan Fujun

1459
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,120
Smokey æ±ç»§

1460
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,200
This Taiwanese food culture system

1461
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,880
These two wrote

1462
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,160
Yaolan, a Taiwanese farmhouse, also has

1463
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,800
There are two very impressive books in Japanese

1464
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,000
This is written by Ben Jingjian

1465
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Satsuma billion horse is

1466
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,640
Another layer of the world of "Jackie Mo" written in Zhang characters

1467
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:11,080
It is the world of Potato

1468
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:16,160
Both sides are wonderfully written and very evil

1469
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:24,200
Especially about the history of the development of feudal arts and foreign languages ââin Japan

1470
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:28,400
is very very clear

1471
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,400
Finally thank you all

1472
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,960
Thank you Li Yuan Restaurant is a wonderful staff

1473
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,960
I don't know if there is any problem doing it now

1474
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,960
please

1475
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,960
borrow a microphone

1476
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:59,520
My question is to say

1477
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,900
Basically I'm thinking of a question which is to say

1478
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,000
Spaniards once came to Taiwan

1479
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Spaniards dated around 1626

1480
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,900
Then the Dutch also came to Taiwan

1481
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:19,900
Then I was thinking that the Dutch came around this time in 1624

1482
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:25,900
In other words, the migration of animals and plants in Taiwan came from these two lines

1483
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,900
Because they went to the Philippines and Manila

1484
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,900
So it is said that the New World was brought from there.

1485
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,900
It is possible that from the perspective of so we see a lot of conversations

1486
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,900
There are many more like this, this, Batavia or Holland

1487
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:45,900
Or India then one of the things I want to ask I want to understand is say in New Zealand

1488
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:49,900
This place in New Zealand is now Sri Lanka

1489
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,900
It was also occupied by the Netherlands in about 1652.

1490
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,900
They did a research on Potenacr one by one

1491
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,900
They found out that the Dutch

1492
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,600
Because Zealand has a history of being occupied by the Netherlands and grapes

1493
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:04,760
they found out

1494
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,400
after the dutch left

1495
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,200
They did a species survey

1496
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:11,400
It turned out that fifty percent

1497
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:14,280
It's exotic

1498
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,800
In other words plants have an invisible velocity

1499
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,480
invade zealand

1500
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,080
So my question is that

1501
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,280
If Taiwan is counted from the year 1624

1502
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,480
The Dutch The Dutch have been in Taiwan for 42 years

1503
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,120
After leaving, there must be an invisible speed

1504
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,320
bring all his stuff in

1505
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,120
what about that thing

1506
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,720
That is, the academician may have talked about a lot

1507
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,440
In terms of flipping or paste that thing

1508
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,520
then just ask

1509
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:43,800
then Taiwan

1510
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,960
Now building has a problem saying

1511
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,320
That is to say Taiwan

1512
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,080
Crash everywhere

1513
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,560
something is eating

1514
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,560
when talking so much

1515
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,080
what is there in taiwan

1516
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:53,960
this is my first question

1517
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,440
The second question is to say

1518
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,880
The academician just said that there is a kind of vanilla

1519
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,880
Valina actually it's a Dutch

1520
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,540
Vanilla its flavor it is an orchid called Vanilla Orchid

1521
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,640
Vanilla's Lan OK

1522
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:09,640
Extract its flavor from that orchid

1523
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:14,840
That is the fruit of a bean in the orchid

1524
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,840
But what you just drew is a disease of a Vanilla

1525
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,040
this bean

1526
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,840
But the problem is that orchids will not cure such a serious disease

1527
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,840
So I'm thinking that this disease is related to the small seeds in the orchid's fruit

1528
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,840
So I'm thinking about this Vanilla disease

1529
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,840
What is the difference between the so-called vanilla and the thing in the orchid? Two questions

1530
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,840
Thank you everyone

1531
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,840
I hope you're not a pig

1532
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:47,840
Vanilla is indeed a orchid pig

1533
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:53,840
But I just showed you that this tomato also has vines and trees.

1534
01:20:53,840 --> 01:21:00,840
so it doesn't have to be your orchid pig just watch this

1535
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,360
Usually used for home decoration

1536
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,720
So Manila is really blue, tree art blue

1537
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,200
And it has to change to be able to

1538
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,720
Only when Manila changes can there be things

1539
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,800
So what I just said

1540
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:24,200
Human beings must be burnt to be able to achieve transformation from birth to death

1541
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,960
what about me

1542
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:35,960
Until now, only when you go to land can you eat in Manila

1543
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:40,120
About Not Just Plants

1544
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,480
all other disseminated

1545
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:47,920
It doesn't have to be a simple path

1546
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,240
so there are many paths to take

1547
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,480
what about this

1548
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,720
Wisme Qing'an

1549
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,760
We are not so simple

1550
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,560
It's not that you eat a macroclump

1551
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,440
or what bacteria

1552
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,000
will drop immediately

1553
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:07,680
This very depends on the period of your contact

1554
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:13,140
The purpose of contacting this party

1555
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:16,640
For example, the Dutch came to Taiwan

1556
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:24,320
Not very generous with the food they brought to Taiwan

1557
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:28,920
Taiwanese people go to steal his to get Dutch beans

1558
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:34,800
Dutch beans are not a free supply brought to Taiwan by the Dutch

1559
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,600
but stolen

1560
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,680
So this is not a line

1561
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,800
So there may be many ways to talk about the sweet potato

1562
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,080
so can't say

1563
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,920
I think Wang Fufu is probably smarter than me

1564
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,780
history does not appear

1565
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:57,340
I don't know if I answered your question or not

1566
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I want to share something and raise a question

1567
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That Gava 516, I once heard the director of the Mandarin Association talk about it

1568
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Nabala is the language of their Paiwan people

1569
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Paiwan language is called Nabbat, it is N-A, then a V-A-T

1570
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It seems that the Paiwan language is developed independently, and there are also such sayings

1571
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Nabbat is used in the south, and Nabbat has many sounds

1572
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I once went to Yunnan, China to see a kind of Nabbat

1573
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Our general Balat size is probably like this or like this, right?

1574
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
It used to be like this, but after improvement, it will look like this

1575
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
The kid I saw in Yunnan had such a big head

1576
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
big

1577
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
right

1578
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
that tree too

1579
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
also that

1580
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
rice water stove tree

1581
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
same tree same leaves

1582
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
I myself am

1583
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
also learn this

1584
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
so i think

1585
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
strangeness

1586
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
why so big

1587
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
should be delicious

1588
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It turned out to be nasty

1589
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
then i go

1590
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
go with him

1591
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
sometimes you that

1592
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Why is this white spicy food so unpalatable?

1593
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
He said

1594
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
what white spicy

1595
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I said that not only what is this called

1596
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Xiangyu

1597
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
nice name

1598
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
elephant area

1599
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I just thought about it

1600
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
domain domain dead domain

1601
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Then I said how to eat this

1602
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
He said

1603
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
eat with honey

1604
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
how to eat

1605
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
oh

1606
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
that's all

1607
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
but i think

1608
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
if say

1609
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
in the country of origin

1610
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
If say in South America

1611
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Origin unknown

1612
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
because

1613
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
His little boy has such a big head

1614
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
It's delicious. It's really big.

1615
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I bought two and both were terrible

1616
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
then i don't know what to say

1617
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
is it from there

1618
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
to Yunnan

1619
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
the one in the mountains

1620
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
To be at the place where Teng Zichong

1621
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
right

1622
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
but so big

1623
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I doubt it

1624
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
strange that

1625
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
he can't possibly go there

1626
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
As a result, he didn't improve this breed.

1627
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
He is very evil

1628
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Hard to say

1629
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
what's the matter

1630
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
my next topic

1631
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
good very happy

1632
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Let's listen to the principal

1633
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
there are real scholars

1634
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
not like me fake

1635
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
hehe

1636
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Hello Mr. Liu

1637
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I am also researching

1638
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,000
food history

1639
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
So I

1640
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Because I think it's hard to be a food scientist

1641
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
become a historian

1642
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
It's hard to be a biologist

1643
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
but i feel teacher

1644
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
can put both

1645
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
ken bai together

1646
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I think I have gained a lot

1647
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Then I think what the teacher said today

1648
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
mainly to say

1649
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
this

1650
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
columbus food

1651
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
some in Taiwan

1652
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
More Biological Effects

1653
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
nutritional impact

1654
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
This way I know there is a

1655
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
John Hopkins teacher called

1656
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Cedrin Mines

1657
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
he studies sugar

1658
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Sugar, sugar can

1659
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
with this sweetness

1660
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
in the caribbean

1661
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
in Western Africa

1662
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
with that british

1663
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
He combines this Triangle

1664
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
U.K.

1665
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
then raised the sugar

1666
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,400
A special place in modern history

1667
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,040
Then I think the teacher means

1668
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,660
of these countries

1669
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,440
It is the food brought to Asia by the ministries of various countries

1670
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,340
Is it possible for us to say

1671
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,700
if further discussion

1672
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:11,300
Is it possible to discuss culturally

1673
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,100
special

1674
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,840
That is to say, there are

1675
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,840
Of course it doesn't have to be like Hitler

1676
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,280
like sugar

1677
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,980
concrete things

1678
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:20,880
caused the final

1679
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,080
Novelties of the Industrial Revolution

1680
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,940
But the teacher's research

1681
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:25,440
In terms of culture, does the teacher feel that

1682
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,400
these foods

1683
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,200
Is there anything about something in Taiwan

1684
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,200
Exotic food in these five hundred years

1685
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,300
is there anything special

1686
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,600
Influence on culture

1687
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,100
Thanks

1688
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,800
The sweetest question is also quite interesting

1689
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:41,200
Well what I just said is very simple

1690
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:44,500
also a lot of this

1691
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:48,200
Of course the path is from the world

1692
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,040
the whole world

1693
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,240
next to become a problem

1694
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,700
is imperialism

1695
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:56,740
related to imperialism

1696
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:59,240
Governing the sugar industry is imperialism

1697
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,240
because of the sugar industry

1698
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,580
Because it requires a lot of low-cost labor

1699
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:11,040
This can only be done with nationalism

1700
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,880
For example, India still uses very

1701
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,240
Tip-Level's coming to fight against Taiwan used to be

1702
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,620
so so

1703
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:24,500
this

1704
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,800
Of course, Wang Huyu often knows here

1705
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:34,720
Dutch dry residue is mainly found in

1706
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,620
Pepper tiles are also planted

1707
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:39,580
Other crabs have also started to grow

1708
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:45,200
This is what some people say is for resistance

1709
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:50,520
Resist selling too much coffee and tea

1710
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,560
so they use

1711
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,640
Use this to make up for it

1712
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,520
did not lose

1713
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,040
Because why the Netherlands also has this plant sugar

1714
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,700
I will try my best to do it

1715
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:08,500
it dutch has had little success with coffee

1716
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,000
Didn't have much success with tea either

1717
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,800
So I had no choice but to develop towards this roasted sugar

1718
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,500
So Zhitang in Taiwan is actually

1719
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,800
Mostly based on the Dutch sugar industry

1720
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
there are still problems

1721
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,800
In fact, we have always wanted to say

1722
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:49,300
Don't forget Yabuy when the Dutch were in gay Taiwan

1723
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:52,800
In fact, it also manages a place called Yagamaga

1724
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,500
But we often go that way, I think

1725
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,200
Too much reliance on the route of the so-called East India Company

1726
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,000
That is to say, we are too dependent on

1727
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,760
We rely too much on this so-called discourse

1728
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,560
Actually, I think it's a little bit wrong

1729
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:07,120
I don't understand that

1730
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,540
Why things must come from India

1731
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,200
dug from the claws

1732
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,620
Because he manages two colonies at the same time

1733
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:15,000
he can also from

1734
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,420
amaica

1735
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:19,000
Because we don't have the Amaica way of thinking

1736
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,800
don't forget the one in amaica

1737
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,160
the so-called that

1738
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,000
Hugo is famous

1739
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,120
what else is he famous for

1740
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,120
His tobacco is also famous

1741
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,720
That means he

1742
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,720
East India Company he came back from Amaica

1743
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,220
When he went around in a circle, he took this so-called

1744
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,720
This, this, I speak Spanish

1745
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:40,720
He also brought Spanish goods to Taiwan

1746
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:44,140
So I think this if explained in this way

1747
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:47,720
Would you be more inclined to say that?

1748
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:50,720
It seems that 7-11 wants to distribute goods, you know

1749
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,220
He is from Southern PU

1750
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,020
Then there is him in the north and HP

1751
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,020
Then I think with such a principle

1752
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:58,220
to explain the path of propagation

1753
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:00,220
will it replace say

1754
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,860
If the Henan East India Company from Java or from India

1755
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:08,140
I think if the East India system at that time is included

1756
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:11,420
Will the history of this practice make another

1757
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:15,460
One by one one by one New interpretation

1758
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:21,020
Of course, I'm talking about the more out-of-the-box one.

1759
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:24,340
statement

1760
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:28,500
Then many scholars here can correct me

1761
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:29,560
But what?

1762
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,220
You also know the 7-11

1763
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,940
from where

1764
01:30:33,940 --> 01:30:36,240
7-11 in Taiwan is from Japan

1765
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,460
Where did Japan's 7-11 come from?

1766
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,740
come from america

1767
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:42,780
So how do you explain this?

1768
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:45,420
is also very difficult to explain

1769
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:49,020
What about the way something spreads?

1770
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:52,060
As I said just now, it's not that simple

1771
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:55,500
So, for example, where does the population of Japan come from?

1772
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:58,840
not from a certain country

1773
01:30:58,840 --> 01:30:59,960
Taiwanese

1774
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So of course what I'm talking about today is just a few examples

1775
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
i'm dead i'm not an expert

1776
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
i just love food

1777
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:21,000
So I can't argue with you what is the fact of the example

1778
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,000
I used to give you the ability to stimulate your imagination

1779
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I will be very satisfied if I stimulate your interest

1780
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Where

1781
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
you just said wood

1782
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Wood

1783
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Subterranean Continents of the World

1784
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
he said

1785
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,600
So what are the first and second largest crops?

1786
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,600
This is also the definition

1787
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,800
then wheat rice

1788
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,600
Does corn count as the third

1789
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,600
this is trainable

1790
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,800
So the most important thing is wheat and rice

1791
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:21,800
then uncle and corn

1792
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:22,800
it's hard to say

1793
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,600
sometimes you crop

1794
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,200
if you grow corn

1795
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,800
make it alcohol

1796
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
if you come to feed the car

1797
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,800
Is it counted as food?

1798
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:39,800
even if it's fake

1799
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,800
two questions

1800
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:45,800
the first is

1801
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,800
How did you research this food

1802
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:50,800
I didn't say it before

1803
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,800
i gave out seven food

1804
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:58,800
A biochemist studies Chinese things

1805
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,240
It has a lot to do with this master

1806
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,240
And I am directly motivated

1807
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,240
I'm going to South America

1808
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,740
When going to South America at the same time

1809
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:14,840
See in person knuckle corn and more

1810
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,840
that's a direct deed

1811
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,840
on the other hand

1812
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,840
I'm not a research practitioner

1813
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,840
Experts who also study practice here

1814
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,340
as far as the 16th century

1815
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:27,340
Many places in China refer to

1816
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,840
are starting to appear

1817
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,840
mentioned these things

1818
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:32,840
And they are all treated as new crops

1819
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:33,840
inside the reporter

1820
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,840
So it's always a matter of peace

1821
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,840
just wrote an article

1822
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,840
called "16th Century"

1823
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:38,840
"15 Classics"

1824
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,840
including years in the mainland

1825
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:41,840
Multiple ranks

1826
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,840
Later there were some recordings

1827
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,840
that is

1828
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:45,840
Just now because it seems that the one

1829
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,840
keep mentioning

1830
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,840
just mentioned how to pass it on

1831
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:49,840
is it possible

1832
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,840
One of them came from China

1833
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,840
This is Taiwan

1834
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:54,840
since the 16th century

1835
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,840
Still in use in the 17th century

1836
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,840
to the 18th century

1837
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,840
When it comes to Qianlong

1838
01:33:58,840 --> 01:33:59,840
also invited someone

1839
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
To promote the cultivation of sweet potatoes all over the country

1840
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Because I also grow in many places

1841
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,500
The character experience is about

1842
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,000
Sweet Potato Saves Many People

1843
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
including saving some

1844
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Because sweet potatoes are so easy

1845
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
And because China's more

1846
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
more restrictive

1847
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Population has been inflating

1848
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
When many things cannot be planted

1849
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Can't grow rice

1850
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
are planted in the sand

1851
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
or hills of hills

1852
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Those are the fish that rely on these peanuts

1853
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
sweet potato and so on

1854
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
When there was no land for growing rice

1855
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
can feed many people

1856
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
and it's harvested very wide

1857
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
So this promotion is

1858
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
not temporary

1859
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Doesn't seem like a source either

1860
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
been promoting

1861
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
sweet potato is a very good

1862
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
until the time of channon

1863
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
there is also a registration station

1864
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
sent someone everywhere to promote

1865
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
promotion sometimes he still has one level left

1866
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
So this thing originated

1867
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
can be quite early

1868
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And there can be many sources

1869
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
and in fact it's not

1870
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
stop all at once

1871
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
but in fact has been

1872
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
You see, from the 16th century to the 18th century

1873
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And record things like overthrowing the book

1874
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
So it's not like Hua Shengmin's first record

1875
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Alive Asan, a Portuguese

1876
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
He is like a Chongqing in the civil war

1877
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
He seems to be the first time that Huasheng Democracy enters China

1878
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
But it was still there until later

1879
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And the source is not one

1880
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
so what i mean is

1881
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Seems like everything should be done

1882
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Or Taiwan or East Asia has some of the most exhausting resources from Central America

1883
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Possibly also from China

1884
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Not necessarily an autonomous introduction to Manila or something

1885
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Yes I have a picture that is

1886
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,000
This arrow goes to many places

1887
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But this is also a question of quantity

1888
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So you said the amount from China

1889
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
What is the amount following through Manila

1890
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
if say or even talk

1891
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,500
This is where it comes from

1892
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:06,000
you can give three four five

1893
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,500
to say this

1894
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:11,500
maybe three or four hours

1895
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,000
and i didn't say it

1896
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
i can't talk that much

1897
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,500
I just wanted to add to that

1898
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,500
friend's opinion

1899
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,500
I think we're talking about a

1900
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,500
origin of species

1901
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,500
means to believe in that species

1902
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:31,500
Where does the special compared to the original come from?

1903
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:33,500
Then we come from this thing

1904
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:35,500
found that

1905
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,500
how it spread

1906
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,500
The last one you mentioned just now has

1907
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,500
I think that's what I agree with

1908
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:44,500
That is to say, the path of this possibility is very different.

1909
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,500
For example, the academician just talked about the spread of water birds

1910
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:48,500
spread with ducks

1911
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:51,500
As for returning to species, where is

1912
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,500
would i think this is not a

1913
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,500
We learn from the spiritual law of spiritual love

1914
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,500
go find that answer

1915
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Will it always form a situation of different opinions and different styles with Chinese culture?

1916
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I think today is a comparison

1917
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I personally research this rather headache problem

1918
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Just came across the Egyptian texts

1919
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Or something like that in Turkish literature

1920
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
But how do we face this theory of origin?

1921
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
This I ask the academician is a scientist

1922
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
That is, where did the species originate from?

1923
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Can you tell me for sure how much you just said is decided

1924
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Diversity determines the origin of that species

1925
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
If so

1926
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Does the area also determine the number of species?

1927
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
so to speak

1928
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Is it possible that it could happen elsewhere

1929
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Thanks

1930
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
this is also possible

1931
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So often it turns out that

1932
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
where is the origin of human

1933
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Currently considered African

1934
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,340
Russi is one, it's based on DNA

1935
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:07,940
If you look at it in other ways in the future

1936
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:10,500
not necessarily that

1937
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:15,880
But now the DNA evidence is very strong

1938
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:20,740
For example, recent reports say

1939
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:24,060
Polaber

1940
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,600
where does it come from

1941
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,700
it's from aylan

1942
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,500
Hui Xiong came

1943
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:35,840
And it was a female female bear

1944
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:38,140
This is based on DNA evidence

1945
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,420
is so

1946
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,240
what about this species

1947
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:44,800
So what about species?

1948
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,380
The question comes immediately, what is called seed

1949
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:53,240
In the past, they were able to mate with each other, and vice versa.

1950
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:57,600
But now this view has also become very complicated

1951
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,400
so it can't be simple

1952
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,380
Then you can judge where this came from. Itâs so simple.

1953
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:10,500
What I just said is that Japanâs ethnicity comes from many sources.

1954
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:16,120
He can talk about the Japanese nation from the outside if he talks about it from the past.

1955
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,900
i ask a final question

1956
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:31,220
I like food very much

1957
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,320
Then I came here today and saw that many of the things written in it are what I like to eat

1958
01:39:36,860 --> 01:39:40,180
But unfortunately after listening to your talk, I found out that these things are all alien species

1959
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:42,760
so maybe

1960
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,860
After listening to today, I will probably go back to find something that is native to Taiwan.

1961
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,980
Because if they all eat exotic species, it means that I am also a foreigner.

1962
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:54,780
This is the first point

1963
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,780
second point

1964
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,980
Just now the academician mentioned something that I think is very important to everyone

1965
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Because you are important in life

1966
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
That is to say, I just mentioned that the white chocolate cannot be eaten.

1967
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Also not good

1968
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
but a lot of yours like to eat dark chocolate

1969
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
But it also mentioned that sugar is poisonous

1970
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Does that chocolate have sugar in it?

1971
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
So how many pills can they eat?

1972
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
is it ok

1973
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Because my wife likes chocolate very much

1974
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
So I have to limit the amount of it

1975
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
so there will be no problem

1976
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
no white chocolate

1977
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:32,000
If it is black, let it eat as much as possible

1978
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
eat less white

1979
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,000
This is mine

1980
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:43,000
But of course you tell people not to smoke

1981
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
People still smoke

1982
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So you tell people not to eat white chocolate

1983
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
People still eat

1984
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Of course, you'll be more at ease after you get married.

1985
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It seems that there is another hand raised

1986
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,100
The humorous questions asked by the two groups

1987
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,600
I'm asking a less humorous question

1988
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,000
That seems to be a lot of people recently

1989
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,100
In particular, Dean Li is very worried that the population is expanding so fast

1990
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,100
Food will be a problem in the future

1991
01:41:15,100 --> 01:41:16,600
From Academician Li's point of view

1992
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,100
what kind of food

1993
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:21,900
It is the most likely solution to our human feeding problem

1994
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:22,800
this is a problem

1995
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,800
Another question is

1996
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,800
It is also a relatively big problem

1997
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,800
Biofuel is a problem

1998
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:29,800
Biofuel is a problem

1999
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:31,800
I've been discussing issues now

2000
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,800
so-called ground personnel

2001
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:35,800
those foods

2002
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,800
not necessarily food

2003
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,800
just these foods

2004
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,800
Which one academician Li thinks is the most likely

2005
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:42,800
Is there any hope that this will help people out

2006
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,800
this person's problem

2007
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,800
Nor does it depend on Nucleic energy

2008
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,800
or other such

2009
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,800
if let me solve it

2010
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:55,800
I think reducing the population is the only way

2011
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,800
this is hard to do

2012
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,800
But you can count

2013
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:07,000
There are limits to using the biological revolution to produce food

2014
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Earth's sunlight is limited Earth's yang energy is limited

2015
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
So the earth's resources are limited

2016
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:22,000
So we can't just use the so-called Green Revolution to solve it

2017
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And the so-called Biofield these so-called substitutes

2018
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:36,000
For example, like using this hall to make alcohol for cars

2019
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Of course it's a sacrifice, and it's also a sacrifice of this land.

2020
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Where you should grow food grow dryness

2021
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
you grow less food to eat

2022
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
This can be solved in the short term

2023
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
long-term problem

2024
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
so i think

2025
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,860
Will this reduce the population is the only way

2026
01:43:04,860 --> 01:43:08,700
Maybe this society has offended many people

2027
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:12,300
our last question

2028
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,480
Thanks

2029
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:16,880
A very wonderful speech by an academician today

2030
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,980
really learned a lot

2031
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:23,780
So I'll take a more personal question

2032
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:26,880
To end today is a question and answer

2033
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:33,020
is your interest in food whether it is your personal interest

2034
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,860
Or academically, professionally

2035
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:39,420
so professional

2036
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:43,260
Then I think Academician, do you have a set?

2037
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:48,380
It is a personal philosophy of this diet

2038
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:50,940
Would you like to share with you

2039
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:55,280
The first one has already been mentioned

2040
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,360
with white chocolate

2041
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,160
The second is

2042
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,560
So it's better to eat less and not more

2043
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,840
This is the first one

2044
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,360
not study

2045
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,200
This is how it can be calculated

2046
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:15,040
I just calculated the calorie requirement

2047
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,160
I can show you

2048
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:19,360
Americans eat too much calorie

2049
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,440
So should reduce

2050
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,080
Because there are too many problems

2051
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,120
and you put diabetes

2052
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:31,040
The so-called cost of medicine

2053
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:34,160
Considerable for the country as a whole

2054
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,840
not only impressive but also terrible

2055
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:43,040
So I think I don't care about these two points.

2056
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,280
almost

2057
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,280
Doctor Li is very good today

2058
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,600
very humorous

2059
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,280
so thank you all for coming today

2060
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:56,000
Thanks

2061
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:56,960
thank you all

2062
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,440
redundant
