A more professional host

10

Vice President Peng

61
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,700
Dear colleagues and guests

62
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,200
thank you all for tonight

63
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,100
Bo Rong came to my lecture

64
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,200
A few listeners who have just been recruited may watch

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,500
There seems to be a big gap in the subtitles of this topic

66
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,700
Kind of like we walk into a movie theater and say

67
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,700
Why is the movie shown today the same as mine

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
It was different from the advertisement

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,640
That was of course a small oversight.

70
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,800
Because I'm changing this slideshow that I've used before

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,500
I tuned everything

72
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,740
just forgot the title

73
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,240
So there's this little glitch

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,840
i think i'm giving a speech today

75
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,040
I want to start with this picture

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,840
I turn back like this and come back to the front

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Feel sorry

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Everyone

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
good

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Start with this picture

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the scene here

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
are these two different stages

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
One is October 2008

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
In Washington, then President George W. Bush

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
held a

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
unprecedented

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,900
we call it G20

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,900
A summit of the G20

89
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,300
it invites

90
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,800
In addition to the traditional so-called

91
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Outside of the leaders of the seven industrialized countries

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,100
then in addition

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
13 special invitations

94
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,100
Then it is generally considered to be called

95
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,300
some call it an emerging market country

96
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,200
this was yesterday

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,300
Not in the traditional Western bloc

98
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,700
those more weighty

99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,100
critical countries

100
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,500
Come join this newly formed

101
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
One of the new peaks of the world

102
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,700
such a mechanism

103
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
Obviously I personally think that means

104
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,400
this scene

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,300
In the future if we are 50 years

106
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,700
Rewrite after 100 years

107
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,900
This is our next month's history

108
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,400
It must be included as a

109
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,300
An important historical development of a

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
a split spirit

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Also known as

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
it when the process

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
it's been a long time

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
change change in structure

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The political map of the world

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Inherited changes

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it has been passed down for generations

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
but

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A lot of history also says

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It has to accumulate momentum to a certain extent.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it will only be generated once

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
more dramatic changes

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Then this change happens when

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was September of that year

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It is the beginning of the second generation crisis in the United States

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Then detonate one by one

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We usually become the financial storm of the century

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
let it sweep the world

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
there are many different

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
vocabulary to describe this economic disaster

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Some say there will be a financial tsunami

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
or etc.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But what I said yesterday

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
held from this group

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
what is it

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's America Europe

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
it found that

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
unprecedented unprecedented unprecedented

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
huge global economic crisis

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
on their own strength alone

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
is not enough

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Other required requests

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Chinese mainland

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
India

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Brazil

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
South Africa

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Indonesia

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Wait, wait, the countries are all together

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
come to the meeting to solve

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Actually hope the country he

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
traditionally speaking

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
if he can monopolize

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This one decides global events

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
this staging

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
he won't invite anyone else

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Since the second generation

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
we make this machine

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
always a decision

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
especially in the economic field

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
decision game

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Register Game Rules

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
determine all global

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
major kind

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
so-called public affairs

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When he later reluctantly accepted the Russian

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
made the eighth member

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
so we usually talk about kiba

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but in fact kiba

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
he really said

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
russia made him inside member

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,760
out of place

172
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,360
It can even be said that it is a dream in the same bed

173
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,040
In fact, its real core is the machine

174
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,960
That, of course, includes the United States and Canada.

175
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
And these five Western European countries

176
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
Then let's say why Western countries

177
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,800
Especially in the United States, it must create a new writing mechanism

178
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,100
it is fully realized

179
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,460
The first is to say

180
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,560
We may call other emerging market countries as well.

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,400
or the country of the developer

182
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,160
Its economic history has reached a

183
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,400
quite a stage of development

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,440
it in fact it has been

185
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,960
what it does affects the global economy

186
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,500
Affects the United States Affects Western Europe

187
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,600
And it was a very, very special scene at the time.

188
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:43,860
Why

189
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,700
That is to say, at that time, whether it was the United States or Western Europe,

190
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,660
their economy suddenly suffered

191
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,700
An unprecedented financial austerity

192
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,100
In financial austerity, it wants to save the market

193
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,360
save the bank

194
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,000
We also need to save many, many investment companies.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
At the same time, to avoid rapid freezing of the economy

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
then create serious business problems

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Of course at this time

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
the first is to say

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Western Europe and the United States have been together for a period of time

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
take some emergency measures

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
it for example

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A sharp rate cut in a short period of time

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
provide liquidity

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Central Bank Helps Many Troubled Banks

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
or securities

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
or an investment bank

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Then take what they have

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So-called junk ticket

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
buy it temporarily

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
then transfer the cash to you

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Solve its mobility difficulties

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
In addition, what does it want

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to make sure is to say

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This so-called global demand

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
that is to buy

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
consumer purchasing power

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Or the willingness of the enterprise to invest

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
don't snap cool

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because of rapid cooling

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
the speed at which the economy is falling

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
would be very very scary

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So at this time it hopes

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
capable country

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
financial expansion

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
special one major investment

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
To maintain this economic demand at a considerable level

227
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
this time we can

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and many more

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They're going to issue a lot of new debt

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to support these special

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We say finance research program

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
or to support

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It temporarily expands these fiscal expenditures for domestic demand

234
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Who will buy these bonds?

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The most powerful are those that have accumulated over a long period of time

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
A large amount of foreign exchange is also exported

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
To maintain this super state of the country

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then here is the city of mainland China

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
one of the most important members

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
In Japan, it is also included in this rank.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
then there is russia

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
South Korea and so on

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In other words

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He also wants these other countries

245
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It can also be launched simultaneously to expand domestic demand

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
increase this financial expenditure

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
In this way, the global effective area

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
maintain a certain degree

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,380
That is to say, it is very simple to say

250
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,340
Under the circumstances at the time

251
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,040
Western countries as the most menacing financial crisis

252
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,040
it must rely on the savings of new england

253
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,840
to save its own financial crisis

254
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,740
make new england

255
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,640
Its new investment and consumption drive the recovery of the world economy

256
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,300
Then this can be said to be

257
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,000
For the first time in one of the world's most important

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,840
In such a mechanism of political consultation and policy coordination

259
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,680
new england nation its importance

260
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,920
its right to speak received a formal confirmation

261
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,020
And immediately it becomes a

262
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,380
One of the most important character mechanics in the world

263
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,320
and it's automated right away

264
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,280
Since the first boil in 2008

265
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,220
Burn this group every year

266
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,120
its influence its importance

267
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,680
cause the world whether it is the financial market

268
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,320
or generally concerned with global economic issues

269
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,420
assistants of these people

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
Pay attention to pay attention to

271
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,240
So the previous one was last year in Mexico

272
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,560
Then his system has basically taken shape

273
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,840
institutionalized

274
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,800
So let me say why this is a very, very important

275
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
a historical watershed

276
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,440
Because what I said at the beginning was to say

277
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,840
before this

278
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,240
This G7 this basic frame

279
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
is the whole of the past we can say global governance

280
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,760
or a decision-making core of public policy or public issues

281
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,240
Before that he was not willing to set up a few more chairs

282
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,280
Invite these admired countries

283
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,440
And these admiring countries

284
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,480
If classified from a certain point of view

285
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,000
In fact, they are all so-called non-Western countries

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,960
non-western countries

287
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,160
What we traditionally call WEST

288
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,440
W is the W of a large business

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,360
very simple

290
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,560
especially western europe

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,600
North America New Zealand Australia

292
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,400
This constitutes our traditional west

293
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,520
when there is a member

294
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,800
he is very special

295
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,160
is Japan

296
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,760
Is he a western country or an asian

297
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
he himself sometimes recognizes

298
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,560
he is not very clear

299
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,120
but no matter

300
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,320
That is, he is basically integrated in what I just said

301
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,080
In this western camp

302
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,320
Then he is also a core member of G7

303
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,680
Well but the truth speaks

304
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,040
That is, the leader in the G7 is the United States

305
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,960
Several other countries are basically

306
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,720
American Horsehead Stack

307
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,080
ok let's say

308
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,440
This represents an important meaning

309
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,320
It's like saying from now on

310
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,200
We look at the entire 21st century

311
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,920
we can say

312
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,480
That is to say, the set we formed after the war

313
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,560
global order

314
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,760
all important international

315
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
Whether in the economic field, the energy field

316
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,360
security field

317
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,040
All important mechanisms Norm development

318
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
it enters a new era

319
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
when this new era

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Does it bring a considerable degree of uncertainty

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
even a certain confusion

322
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Or is it able to transition smoothly to a new power structure

323
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This is of course our very, very concern

324
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because it is impossible for us in Taiwan to escape the impact of such a structural reorganization

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So in this process, I would like to highlight

326
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That is to say why we especially emphasize that flying to western countries

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Moreover, in Western countries, another integration mechanism that has already taken shape is used as its leader

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This integration mechanism is a simple English abbreviation we often see now

329
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The abbreviation is brics

330
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
one country

331
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Exactly five letters represent the so-called BRIC countries

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Originally, the word BRIC

333
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Turns out it was nothing but Gomense

334
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This is a famous man who used to

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This one is in charge of his investment

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
this chief

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Then in order to package a new investment product

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Mutual Fund Products

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
a promotional concept used

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
At that time he was called BRIC

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It is said that these four economies will grow very fast in the future

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Investing in newspapers is very high

343
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So he attracts the attention of all investors

344
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
let him create the concept

345
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
But I didn't expect to say this concept

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Slowly it turned into a new one

347
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A sign of what we call a political bloc

348
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and later joined South Africa

349
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Then the BRIC countries we are talking about will be formed.

350
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Moreover, the BRICS countries actually created their own summits

351
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
own coordination mechanism

352
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He said that he is no longer a

353
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
just a category

354
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,580
a combination in the sense

355
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,540
it is already an entity

356
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,620
Then it also represents all countries of this development

357
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,920
for its main task

358
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,800
Then we look at this picture and we will know that

359
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,260
The structure of the world economy

360
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,960
In fact, a very profound change has taken place

361
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,560
This is from 2007 to 2012

362
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,700
not yet the end of the year

363
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,660
A simple analysis of this third level

364
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,100
Then this analysis tells us that

365
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,040
That is to say, the growth of the world's GDP

366
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,580
Where is its main source of contribution

367
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,360
what kind of a group is it

368
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,800
That is to say, a global economic growth supported by contribution sources

369
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,860
For example, in 2007, the growth rate was 4%.

370
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,000
4.1% of global economic GDP

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Sorry 2007

372
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,080
The first season is divided into seasons

373
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,140
Then I can see that it means

374
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,540
This 4% of its contribution

375
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,340
Which comes from this so-called traditional advanced industrial country

376
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,040
This includes the West plus Japan I just mentioned

377
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,580
Basically the concept

378
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,700
Then such a proportion

379
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,240
About this 4%, probably less than

380
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,680
Less than 17% of this

381
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,480
Its growth contributes to the growth of the world

382
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,780
Then the contribution of the BRIC countries is this dark green

383
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,680
deep blue how big do you see

384
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,080
almost more than half

385
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,880
In other words, it contributed more than 50% of the growth rate

386
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,480
And what's left are the other so-called emerging market countries

387
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,980
So you can understand the strength of the BRICs

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Or at least he's not only fast

389
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And his average growth rate is very very amazing

390
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
He probably averages this way and the speed tends to be

391
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Double or triple the speed of European or American countries

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
plus his size

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
combined to produce such a large

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A huge force that drives economic growth around the world

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay, then of course we'll talk

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
08 Because of this

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This Lehman Brothers appeared after September

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
In the future, the rapid spread of a global financial crisis

399
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So so to this 3G 4G in 2008

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
3G in front of 2009

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
what's going on in the world economy

402
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Caught in one of the lowest growth ever

403
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The world economy as a whole has no sub-growth

404
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
not at all

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
but what is almost

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
almost zero growth

407
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And why he was able to maintain

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This is not secondary growth

409
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,200
All contributions are in BRICS

410
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,500
The five island countries were also hit during this period

411
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,100
Because after all, exports are considerably affected

412
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,300
But soon the economy rebounded

413
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,900
Then during the economic rebound

414
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,500
In 2010, especially in 2011, it is particularly obvious

415
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,300
Later we also know that

416
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,200
In that year, Taiwan once appeared for a long time

417
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,500
I haven't seen two books in 30 years

418
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,600
Because it bounces from a vice really long

419
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,100
Then you can also see that

420
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,400
throughout the recovery process of the economy

421
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,100
This whole so-called rich country

422
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,500
Western Europe plus Japan

423
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,300
it's very very weak

424
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,900
especially as time makes it longer

425
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,400
The weaker physique of its recovery becomes more obvious

426
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,800
Then in reverse, we can say that the BRIC countries

427
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,100
It still maintains a let's say

428
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,000
A major player in driving the world's economic recovery

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,760
It can be seen here

430
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,400
That is to say, in today's world economic map

431
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,560
This has become a new structure

432
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,360
We could even say a new normal

433
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,680
This is no longer a transient phenomenon

434
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,600
It could be a decade or fifteen years in the future

435
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,920
A regular phenomenon even longer

436
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,120
Of course, we said that many factors will affect such a comparison

437
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,440
difference in strength difference in comparison

438
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,760
Can it last for a long time

439
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,560
Of course there are many uncertainties

440
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,640
Of course I am for adults

441
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,520
is that social science is usually an afterthought

442
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,360
hindsight

443
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
Usually it can be said that after the event

444
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,200
it can go for various reasons

445
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,160
But let me tell you

446
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,120
Our natural science scholars who study earthquakes are similar

447
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,320
That is to say, after an earthquake, it will be said

448
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,720
This is the shallow layer This is the biosphere

449
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Where is Zhenyang?

450
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,260
then what

451
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,900
then but when

452
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,360
There will be a magnitude 6 earthquake next time

453
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,600
where is zhenyang

454
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,760
I don't think the school can speak for itself today

455
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,100
The same goes for economics, right?

456
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,200
Rarely has this any mainstream economics ever predicted

457
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,000
0708 will fall into such a global crisis

458
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,800
that's okay

459
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,240
but we just

460
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,800
So whatever I say today

461
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
about the future

462
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,360
Of course, everyone can ask questions.

463
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,660
I also have to admit

464
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,760
no one can be confident

465
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,020
take a crystal ball

466
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,660
You can say what the future will be like

467
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
But what?

468
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,360
The reason why I came here for this analysis

469
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,420
how much still think that is to say

470
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,300
still have some very long trends

471
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,560
follow this trend

472
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,820
some fundamental forces at work

473
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,300
Those trends seem to me

474
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,460
not in the short term

475
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,060
That is to say, it is easy for huge fluctuations to occur

476
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,260
Then we say that the structure is beginning to change

477
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,860
Not only I am in strength

478
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,240
We say that this is headed by the BRICS

479
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,160
The so-called New West

480
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,660
or what I call non-western countries

481
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,040
they quickly

482
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,660
from a supporting role on the stage of history

483
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,160
Has come to a mere area where prices can be combined

484
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,460
It can even be said that in some respects

485
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,340
is to go beyond the traditional

486
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,300
Protagonist on this stage of history

487
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,660
That's Europe and the United States

488
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,960
Then he will tell the whole world

489
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,960
various important issues

490
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,420
his decision

491
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,620
What kind of way might he be in the future

492
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,120
or program to handle

493
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,920
will have a profound impact on

494
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,620
Because it used to be in many important fields

495
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,520
so to speak

496
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,720
Even if the United States says

497
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
or

498
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,120
western europe is dominant

499
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Then other countries will be invited to the meeting

500
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
But generally speaking

501
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,920
this

502
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,080
it's expected to say it's here to cheer

503
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
Or come and accept these New England countries

504
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,480
give them some

505
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,240
considered more advanced

506
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,040
more scientifically based

507
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,480
these proposals

508
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,040
Then they come back together

509
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,400
Then in fact we say

510
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,680
Now we say slowly this whole world

511
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,000
We say political economy structure

512
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,480
It has undergone a fundamental change

513
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,440
It is also immediately followed by signs that you can see it

514
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
it has a lot of effects

515
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,280
I give a very suggested example

516
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,160
must book in kyoto

517
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,920
In this process of failure

518
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,240
Then Western European countries are very anxious

519
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,760
he wished to go quickly

520
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
A Post-Kyoto Agreement

521
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,480
global climate change

522
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,760
led by the United Nations

523
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,800
past in this issue

524
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,120
America is basically the equivalent of a negative

525
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And because negativity is tantamount to absence

526
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Because he was the first one to deny the so-called global warming problem

527
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Or know many witnesses in the United States I don't want to admit

528
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And he doesn't want to be

529
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
any greenhouse gas emissions

530
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Any new constraint of a norm

531
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Therefore, he did not sign the Tokyo epidemic figure in the previous stage.

532
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So I say his attitude is negative

533
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
In the past on this subject

534
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
CO is dominant

535
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
CO is when to continue hoping to dominate post-KP

536
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Inside all these global climate change meetings

537
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The setting of all major issues and his conclusion

538
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
form a consensus

539
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But they didn't expect outside

540
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This time in 2009

541
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What was supposed to be a pivotal meeting

542
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
should have been this time

543
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It should be the basic framework of the post-Kyoto Protocol

544
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
In fact, the so-called consensus is actually based on

545
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I hope that the program planned by Vietnam abroad

546
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But this meeting basically

547
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
so to speak miscarriage

548
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
why

549
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Because Russia was not in it at that time

550
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
However, China and India

551
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and this south africa

552
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
This is also Brazil

553
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
These four countries

554
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
They go to the corresponding plan of grass mud

555
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And what does he think this countermeasure

556
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
From the perspective of developing countries

557
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
more fair

558
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Because of the version fried by Western European countries

559
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
or Western European countries

560
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Or consider his own self-interest

561
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
as a starting point

562
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Although he may ostensibly package it as

563
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
He has a certain so-called impartiality

564
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Then the two versions are too far apart

565
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It is difficult to knead in a short time

566
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And at that meeting there was a

567
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
always in

568
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That is to say, the entire international community after the war

569
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
never a scene

570
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
This scene means

571
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This time because Obama just came up

572
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
He wants to turn the world against the United States

573
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
say about this

574
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
The United States is very passive in resisting this proposal of global warming.

575
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Obama says I'm different

576
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
right

577
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I, the Democratic Party or I personally attach great importance to this issue

578
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So he wants to make a comparison

579
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
A more basic role than in the past

580
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Then he also discovered such a trend

581
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
As far as the plan of Western Europe is concerned with this development country

582
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Expected program has considerable distance

583
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
so he'd love to make a fist

584
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
he wants to make fist

585
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
so he was hours before this cracked

586
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He said I want to find Wen Jiabao

587
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Say sorry Wen Jiabao came to the meeting

588
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
can't find him

589
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He said I'm looking for the Prime Minister of India

590
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
The Indian PM replied saying sorry he was in a meeting

591
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
can't find

592
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No one ever said the President of the United States

593
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
At the summit, you need to find the head of state of a certain country to meet him

594
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
say sorry not available

595
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and it's wonderful

596
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
He found four countries and said no

597
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
He said that these four countries are having a small meeting

598
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Close the door and I'm in a meeting

599
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
and didn't invite me

600
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
how is this possible

601
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
right

602
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I told them I wanted to meet you

603
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Everyone says sorry we're in a meeting

604
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
wait a minute

605
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This is a different continent

606
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
It can be said that the United States

607
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
For this president

608
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
This can be said to be 50 years

609
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A scene that hasn't been seen in 60 years

610
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Well, Obama's kind of funny too.

611
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
He doesn't worry too much about this face at all.

612
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
He found out

613
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Say these four are in a meeting right now

614
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I will rush over

615
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I see if they open the door

616
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But why am I talking about this dramatic scene?

617
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We say many things called overnight fall

618
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You know watching a scene where a lot of drama happens

619
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
unprecedented

620
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
interactive way

621
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You know what the world is like

622
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,000
Fundamental changes in the world

623
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,000
In fact, a fundamental change

624
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So this basically means

625
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
I especially want to say that

626
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,600
That is to say we are working on a

627
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,000
We are already entering a period in history

628
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
very important new stage

629
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,300
What about this new stage?

630
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,200
may be very unfamiliar to us

631
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,300
because of what?

632
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,900
because most of us here

633
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,200
I'm sure there are of course a few who are much older than me.

634
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Probably born before WWII

635
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,700
But basically one of our main life experiences

636
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,400
It all started after World War II

637
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,400
Then some people may be born later

638
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,700
Right, some people might have been born in 1970

639
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,900
1988, right?

640
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,300
but no matter

641
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,600
we say the past 60 years

642
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,200
we are very used to it

643
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,900
so-called world affairs

644
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,600
That is, the United States plus Europe

645
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,100
The family will come later

646
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
lead by them

647
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
right

648
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
all news reports

649
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
all

650
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
our biggest concern

651
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Every time the G7 is going to meet

652
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
right

653
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
so what's the big deal this time

654
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
etc.

655
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
how he might affect

656
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Global economy

657
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
or how they might go about dominating trade negotiations

658
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
how to lead

659
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
this about this zygote

660
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The arms proliferation negotiations

661
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Etc., etc

662
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
how does he lead this

663
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Intellectual Property Student Negotiation

664
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I now have rule making

665
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because he will affect us who are smart

666
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And it's hard for us to participate

667
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
we have to adapt to him

668
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
How to change the international rules

669
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
you can only

670
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Just find a way to adapt to this new game rule

671
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
but

672
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
right now we

673
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I just say

674
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Now actually enter a

675
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
a new historical era

676
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And this historical era

677
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
is very unfamiliar to us

678
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
we can even say

679
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
many people in taiwan

680
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
should say

681
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
the head hasn't turned yet

682
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
haven't realized yet

683
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm ready to face this new era

684
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
including our beauty

685
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,080
talk for nothing

686
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,380
why do i say that

687
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,880
if you watch our media

688
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,080
like this

689
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,380
This BRICS meeting

690
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,740
most recent summit

691
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,380
held in this derban in south africa

692
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,080
Look at which TV station in our country

693
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,380
Is there any live report in the group area of ​​this exclusive interview?

694
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,380
No

695
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,180
Which newspaper has a special correspondent?

696
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,580
Did you go to derban for an interview?

697
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,380
No

698
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,080
as if it has nothing to do with us

699
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,560
or think this thing

700
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,760
Such a BRICS summit

701
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,020
what does it decide

702
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,060
Much like having no effect on the world

703
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,420
because if it has an effect on the world

704
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,360
will definitely affect Taiwan

705
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,760
How could it not affect Taiwan?

706
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,260
right

707
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,960
So I say our own mentality

708
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,360
Our own mental preparation can't keep up

709
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,680
Why

710
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,460
Because we're still too used to that

711
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,480
That means our focus is on Washington DC

712
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,020
right

713
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,120
my focus is on london

714
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,260
or I put in the middle of this

715
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,560
put in the middle

716
00:30:59,560 --> 00:30:59,960
so

717
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,200
But what is the purpose of my speech today?

718
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,680
that is special that is to say

719
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,000
Hope to share with you too

720
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,320
I myself have been right for more than ten years

721
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,920
An observation, an experience of this global political economy

722
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,400
Which means we're really entering a new

723
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,920
a historical stage

724
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,160
Then what

725
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,640
this stage of history

726
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,280
Many of its markings will be readjusted

727
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,760
And we're going to start exploring

728
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,160
or to start to rediscover it

729
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,360
get to know it

730
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,600
so that for ourselves

731
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,800
The future meets us

732
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,160
next ten years twenty years

733
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,840
or longer external whole

734
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,600
This doesn't matter

735
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,120
That is to say, the East Asia we promoted

736
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,360
Asia Pacific

737
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,000
all the way to the world

738
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,680
all grand challenges

739
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,480
we can

740
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,880
There is a better preparation

741
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
a kind of preparation

742
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,040
I personally have some paid for

743
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
some opinions

744
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,600
That is to say, although we say that many Western media are right now

745
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,000
The combination of Jin'an Five Kingdoms

746
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,400
he is still

747
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,800
Although he didn't use the rabble

748
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,900
But he always said this is still this

749
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,800
very very loose

750
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,400
Or they also think that the differences within him are greater than the consensus

751
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,000
so don't like him at all

752
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,700
don't like him

753
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,400
I think such a view of him

754
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,200
It can't be said that there is no basis at all.

755
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,400
But it's kind of a sour grapes mentality

756
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,600
Because after all he is not used to it

757
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,600
that is to say before

758
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,300
It's only for me to be him, right?

759
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Now these guys set up another stage

760
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,000
then start singing

761
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,500
and this play

762
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
It seems that the more you sing, the more lively you are

763
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,400
He's going to replace me or at least cover me up

764
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,400
So this mood is still very, very complicated

765
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,700
But if we look at it more objectively

766
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,000
So I think in the short term in the future that is to say

767
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Regardless of whether the so-called non-Western world headed by the five financial countries

768
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It will gradually gain the right to speak on many global issues

769
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
in various fields

770
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
including environment including energy

771
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Including trade, including finance, etc.

772
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
in all important areas

773
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
We say the most familiar G7 in the past

774
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That is to say, it is a multilateral system

775
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Multilateral Cooperation Mechanism

776
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund

777
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
or WTO

778
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The World Trade Organization that we are more familiar with

779
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
These are the side mechanisms

780
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
That is to say, the formulation of the norms

781
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
In dominance it also begins to be

782
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
even though we're not saying it's superseded

783
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
but definitely share

784
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Well, if Western countries are unwilling to share

785
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
what might happen then

786
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
what will non-western countries do

787
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
There will be a new one, and the protest will be stopped

788
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
In fact, we have seen this area

789
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,400
In fact, not only non-Western countries

790
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,200
It may also try to make its paint different from the barrier

791
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,600
the other way around

792
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,400
If there is some kind of global organization

793
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
If in it non-western countries have become Tutors

794
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,200
It's turned into a corner

795
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,400
Western countries are likely to start a bit

796
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,800
when you feel marginalized

797
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,800
It simply makes a small mechanism by itself

798
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,000
In it, it still has a certain right to paint

799
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,800
Because it feels that in the big mechanism

800
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,000
it turns out it can be painted

801
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
It can't be painted now, can it?

802
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,600
The whole organization talks about the direction of major resolutions

803
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,800
It will be farther and farther away from its expectations.

804
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,400
This is what is happening in the WTO today

805
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,900
Because before the WTO

806
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
U.S.

807
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,400
Western Europe

808
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Japan

809
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,600
discussed

810
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,100
almost

811
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,400
the case can be settled

812
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,300
When it's time to spend more rounds of negotiation

813
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:57,800
different

814
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,900
On the one hand it of course means that it wants

815
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,700
demand more on some public political issues

816
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,900
included in this global world trade agreement

817
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,500
This interferes in the internal affairs of many countries

818
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,100
its labor food safety intellectual property

819
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,400
Etc. various legislative packaging for procurement

820
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,600
what about this time

821
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,400
Many open countries feel that

822
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,700
This has a great impact on many, many economic life orders in their country

823
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,900
or the protection of democratic industries

824
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,700
The impact is too great, strengthen the system

825
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,900
Or the impact on farmers is too great

826
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,500
India is on the fence with the United States

827
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,600
Then Brazil China India

828
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,400
It also slowly discovered on this topic that

829
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,700
They have more in common

830
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,300
then and what

831
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,800
It can call on more other open countries

832
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,700
come to their side

833
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,900
So why does the United States want to engage in TPP now?

834
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,400
Trans-Pacific Pornage

835
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,700
In fact, it is because of the WTO that it is no longer sufficient to control

836
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,100
right

837
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:49,800
then i will

838
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,500
Then I'll draw something out

839
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,600
I'm still old in it

840
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
OK I can lead

841
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,100
because of what

842
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,200
What about the larger piece of magnetic paper?

843
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
I'm already in it and don't want to

844
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,160
It's always the boss

845
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,240
Then another one we can also observe

846
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,120
This observation I certainly don't need it to happen

847
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,440
But I don't think it's a small possibility

848
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,800
That is to say, for a long time before and after the war

849
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,560
The United States is for free trade

850
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,640
its prime mover

851
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,560
what about europe

852
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,680
A little distance from the United States on some issues

853
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,560
But on the whole

854
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,800
It still accepts American leadership

855
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,400
to promote the gradual liberalization of world trade

856
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,000
When this is also the reason

857
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
They will use a free trade system

858
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,120
When on the one hand it is a kind of

859
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,920
sustainable development

860
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,120
then it is a mutually beneficial

861
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,680
All countries can benefit from the trade process

862
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,920
Get a Bigger One Economically

863
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,760
But there is another consideration

864
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,080
we are free in this

865
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Many of our industries are highly competitive

866
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It can expand in a larger development space

867
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
so i'm not afraid of competition

868
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Because how many countries in the world can manufacture civil aviation airliners

869
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
only two

870
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
One Airbus, one Boin

871
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Of course, there were several others that were slowly merged.

872
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
How many countries will do when resonance machines

873
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
only siemens

874
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
machine

875
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So free trade

876
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And these are expensive

877
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
one is all

878
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
If it's an airplane, it's hundreds of millions of dollars

879
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
such a machine

880
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It will cost millions of dollars for Mr. Rong to buy it.

881
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
these are high value

882
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
and technically

883
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
it's quite exclusive

884
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
but the world has changed

885
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
What does the world change mean?

886
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
In fewer and fewer industries

887
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
In the field of manufacturing

888
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
enjoying such an absolute advantage

889
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
there are less and less

890
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,500
well less and less

891
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,200
Then the other way around is to say

892
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
The United States started early eight years ago

893
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,000
become a trading sub-state

894
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
right

895
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,500
This is it

896
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,200
Buy more from others and export less

897
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,700
And there are a lot of agricultural products in the export

898
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,300
Kind of like a third world export structure

899
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,400
when it was later repositioned to services

900
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,000
to the service industry

901
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,600
Western European countries also have this problem

902
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,900
In addition to Germany still maintaining a

903
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,800
Very solid and strong industrial system

904
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,400
And in many other important industries

905
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,500
it maintains its fundamental advantage

906
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,800
But many countries are

907
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,200
It can be said that it is becoming more and more fragile

908
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,600
Regardless of whether it is a car, etc., various fields

909
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,800
So in this case the words to say are

910
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,200
Instead

911
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,300
emerging market country

912
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,800
Then it will instead feel like saying

913
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,100
Only trade such a global one

914
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Arrange by yourself

915
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
he has many opportunities

916
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And this one that provides him with rapid economic development

917
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
good help

918
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Because the American market is too small

919
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
right

920
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
He can use external demand to drive

921
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Accelerate the growth rate of his own economy

922
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Many of them think that

923
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
oh

924
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Mainland China only joined the WTO in 2011

925
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Some say he is the biggest beneficiary

926
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Not only did he not worry that his door was open

927
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Then many of his industries will be wiped out

928
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
No

929
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Of course there are few examples

930
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
but not much

931
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
In most cases it means

932
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The growth of his outlet

933
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
the one with his product

934
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Missed this this this this this

935
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This means upgrading

936
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
faster than anyone imagined

937
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So, in this situation, speaking

938
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
that is

939
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Protectionist production in Europe and the United States is on the rise

940
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Especially when we look at Europe now

941
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,440
so high unemployment

942
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,240
Unemployment especially in the youth

943
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,800
that's terrible

944
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,680
And it's not a transient phenomenon

945
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,640
This kind of high unemployment rate will not be seen in a short time

946
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,040
can't see at all

947
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,880
it has the potential to slow down

948
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,740
under this circumstance

949
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,040
That is to say, these countries

950
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,200
it used to be traditionally

951
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,840
its party no matter left party right party

952
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,200
It can basically maintain a domestic

953
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
a stronger consensus

954
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
cross-party consensus

955
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,400
an open economic order

956
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,000
a free trade system

957
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It should be accessible to all countries

958
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,400
On this consensus in the postwar

959
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,800
It's held up very, very strong for a while

960
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,400
but can it continue

961
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,800
This is also a worthwhile observation

962
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,700
Of course it is possible that this wave they may

963
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,600
bud or tooth first

964
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,900
new immigrants from european countries

965
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Immigrants from Southern Europe, North Africa, Eastern Europe

966
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,100
Gao Yang

967
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,200
but it's likely to come down

968
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
will allow this protectionism to grow

969
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,500
another trend

970
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
I think the future is also worth watching

971
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
I think it's also likely to happen

972
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,000
That is to say, it is good to go to Taiwan

973
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,500
East Asian countries

974
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,000
This island of all exports is like this country of Taiwan

975
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,500
Probably it most of this product

976
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,500
It is produced around the needs of consumers in Europe and the United States

977
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
right

978
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,000
Look at our Hon Hai OEM, right?

979
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,500
iPhone right?

980
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Usually the first batch of goods must be shipped to the United States first

981
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,500
The second shipment is now going to Europe

982
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,000
meet again in tokyo

983
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Taipei usually always has to play a few steps

984
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
this is natural

985
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
because its main market has a place

986
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
But because the future we can see

987
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,500
U.S. economic growth will have decelerated

988
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
And the United States because it has a new population

989
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,000
immigrants come in

990
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Let it have a discovery of new energy

991
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So it may be considered in Western countries

992
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,500
But still a more likely to maintain

993
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,540
better for growth

994
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,860
But the situation in Europe is very worrying

995
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,900
But generally speaking

996
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,220
EU plus US market

997
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,260
overall demand growth

998
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,820
is unlikely to have much expectations

999
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,100
impossible to be too optimistic

1000
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,640
So you can take a look at the future

1001
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,940
among emerging economies

1002
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,480
if you want to maintain it

1003
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,040
must grow rapidly

1004
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,340
it has to pull each other out

1005
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,900
which means I start to focus

1006
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,720
How could I possibly have more follow-up

1007
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,740
Eastern Europe

1008
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,600
Sorry how does latin america do more business with east asian countries

1009
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,640
East Asian countries are more closely related to Latin America

1010
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,680
with africa

1011
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,700
with south asia

1012
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,280
will be closer to each other

1013
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,560
contact

1014
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,840
whether in

1015
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,380
trading

1016
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,400
invest

1017
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,940
There are other areas of cooperation

1018
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,240
I think this is also a new trend

1019
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,540
new trend

1020
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,480
Then there is another thing worth observing, that is,

1021
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
because we say so

1022
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,280
The United States as the entire postwar world order

1023
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,100
a principal a designer

1024
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,600
is also its sustainer

1025
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,400
an operator

1026
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,000
It can basically be said that there are three big funding

1027
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,400
This funding is roughly

1028
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,480
one is its defense

1029
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,200
is its military power

1030
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,360
This is very important

1031
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,080
As of today, the beginning of the world's national defense

1032
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,080
Add all defenses together

1033
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,160
Nearly half are American

1034
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,080
one country

1035
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,120
Its total national defense initially exceeds that of all other countries combined

1036
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,360
Of course it may not be

1037
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,760
slightly less

1038
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,040
but that is to say

1039
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,320
It has been maintained like this

1040
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,200
such a definite

1041
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,720
Then another important grant

1042
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
of course it is economical

1043
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,480
And this economy used to be finance and traditional manufacturing

1044
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,520
is in the price range

1045
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,080
bipolar

1046
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
But now we take the traditional manufacturing

1047
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Just like the United States in many fields

1048
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
has slowly hollowed out

1049
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Hollow out

1050
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
But finance is a

1051
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
apologies for the location it's still a

1052
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
its supposed dominion over all the affairs of this world

1053
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
an important bargaining chip

1054
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
especially its dollar

1055
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
To be the most important reserve currency in the world

1056
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
So all countries in the world

1057
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
If you borrow too much

1058
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Especially like borrowing money from abroad

1059
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
will face foreign debts for themselves

1060
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Only the United States did not have this problem for a short period of time

1061
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
because of what

1062
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Because people all over the world use U.S. dollars

1063
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
as a major reserve currency

1064
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
So it just prints greenbacks

1065
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
OK

1066
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
it can be exchanged for something

1067
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I print dollars and I can have oil

1068
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I can print US dollars for iPhone

1069
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I helped him assemble that iPhone from Hon Hai

1070
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Although Apple is a so-called American company

1071
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,440
But the Apple of the United States is in the United States

1072
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,880
It has very few corners

1073
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,680
OK

1074
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,040
because it's most of this

1075
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,080
Many other producing countries are abroad

1076
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,080
So let's talk about the post-war one

1077
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,440
U.S.-led

1078
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,600
or Western countries dominate this

1079
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,560
This power structure of the global political economy

1080
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,560
Probably its most important pillar looks at the back

1081
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,640
then probably say

1082
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
which is very important

1083
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,160
Is the United States unable to maintain the hegemony of the dollar financially?

1084
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,920
if this lost

1085
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,680
would be fatal for the United States

1086
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,920
its leadership

1087
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,640
A fatal blow to hegemony

1088
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,400
So if it can't be done effectively

1089
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,000
a better economic recovery

1090
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,200
and for

1091
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,360
that is

1092
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,640
this

1093
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,960
long-term value of the dollar

1094
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,360
Provide a minimum guarantee

1095
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,640
And if it can't stop this constantly massively hard American super

1096
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,200
such a such a such a such a

1097
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:17,440
It can even be said that it is a set of economic payment policies to quench thirst.

1098
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,960
sooner or later it will trigger

1099
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,760
Confidence in the dollar such a crisis

1100
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,960
that third pillar

1101
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,200
Well, most people say it's the American system.

1102
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,640
culture or its values

1103
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,480
That means I said there are three pillars

1104
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,200
U.S. leadership one is military

1105
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,120
The second is economic

1106
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,600
In economics, I will talk about finance

1107
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,480
Its importance now exceeds its manufacturing

1108
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,200
traditional industry

1109
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,960
then come on it's

1110
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,920
That is to say, it is a kind of soft power, which is usually called soft power.

1111
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,840
That is to say, its set of values

1112
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,680
And this value is embodied in its way of life

1113
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,120
its shape of social functioning its democratic stamina

1114
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Can he still maintain a kind of admiration for others?

1115
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
right

1116
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
willing to learn

1117
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And that means getting closer to him

1118
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
such a situation

1119
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So

1120
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Well of course this looks

1121
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
america for a while

1122
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
may still be maintained

1123
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But what?

1124
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
His premise is also

1125
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
his production system

1126
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
In the next 20 to 25 years

1127
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
there are many great challenges

1128
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Can he overcome

1129
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
These great challenges include

1130
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
his financial crisis

1131
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
his financial crisis

1132
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
among his generations

1133
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
so-called fairness and justice

1134
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Because now the United States and many European countries

1135
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
including Taiwan

1136
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Our so-called postwar baby boomers

1137
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
including me

1138
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Slowly entering retirement age

1139
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Then what

1140
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The next population will slowly

1141
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
appear this we say

1142
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Rapid population growth

1143
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,520
reduce or lessen

1144
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,220
even wee long questions

1145
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,320
There will be so many people who need to be captured in the future

1146
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,460
many old retirees

1147
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,920
Medical Insurance Needs

1148
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,020
Will the new generation in the future be able to carry it?

1149
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,020
This issue is very acute

1150
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,560
Usually politicians compare

1151
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,720
Can only take care of my own two terms

1152
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,760
He put the issue usually deferred

1153
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,760
may be more difficult to deal with later

1154
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,360
third challenge

1155
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,520
America is already experiencing

1156
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,020
That is to say, in the past, American society

1157
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,920
After all, it is a Western European culture

1158
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,020
Or a society with white people as the main axis

1159
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,080
other ethnic groups from other countries

1160
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,020
slowly into it

1161
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,180
integrate into this society

1162
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,120
So it has a name called Melting Park

1163
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,920
But in the end it merged and it became an America

1164
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,220
american identity

1165
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,720
American mainstream culture English

1166
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,540
but now because

1167
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,040
No

1168
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,040
The traditional population refers to the population with this identity background of European nationality

1169
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,160
increase too fast

1170
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,460
Especially when we know it's Latino

1171
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,080
population in the southern states

1172
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,840
They're almost halfway there

1173
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,280
Or say they add Asians

1174
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,480
Plus blacks, more than half

1175
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,840
then the whole country of the United States

1176
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,000
if you go to see this in black

1177
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,360
his usual every family

1178
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,680
The number of children he raised is relatively more

1179
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,120
Latinos too

1180
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,640
For Asians, there is less obvious trend

1181
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,880
But because of the large number of new arrivals of Asians

1182
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,560
right

1183
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,680
from Mainland China

1184
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,400
from asia

1185
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,640
So the system

1186
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,720
That is to say, how he will face a future is a multi-dimensional

1187
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,120
And this pluralism is the source of disintegration

1188
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,080
I used to say that no matter where you come from

1189
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,440
You only need to come to America for the second generation

1190
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,120
your child is

1191
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,400
is American

1192
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,900
His English is completely native

1193
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,200
right

1194
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,600
no problem with identification

1195
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,000
no problem of integration

1196
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,600
but now it's different

1197
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
now in california

1198
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,500
in texas

1199
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,000
in New Mexico

1200
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,400
There are some newspapers in their own community

1201
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,500
has its own radio

1202
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,100
Then this diversity

1203
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,500
In fact, the United States is now troubled by many traditional grades.

1204
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,600
do you want a

1205
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,400
Newspapers have an open and tolerant attitude

1206
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,000
Or to strengthen that fusion

1207
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,900
to integrate it into the mainstream

1208
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,500
that is

1209
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,400
these are what i just said

1210
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,000
The Democratic President of the United States will face several major challenges in the future

1211
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,600
Yesterday we could say that

1212
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,600
future event

1213
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,100
Of course we say there are many changes

1214
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,500
Of course, we can't fully foresee

1215
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,100
the direction it might go

1216
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,700
but there is a

1217
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,800
I think it is very worthy of our attention

1218
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,000
that's what i just said

1219
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
In the BRICS countries already in the traditional

1220
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,200
In addition to the role mechanism of the global South-Central class dominated by Europe and the United States

1221
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,800
Another stove

1222
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:09,600
This reinvention has two purposes

1223
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,600
One, when in turn it is also fighting

1224
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,400
or create a pressure

1225
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,800
Let the United States and Europe must

1226
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,000
more comprehensive acceptance of their

1227
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,200
The right to participate and speak

1228
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,800
share that access with

1229
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,600
Including the transformation of existing European and American-based

1230
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,200
all major international organizations around the world

1231
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,200
its power structure

1232
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,800
For example, let's see today

1233
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,800
Said the United Nations has five ordinary members

1234
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,100
including Britain and France

1235
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,300
But in terms of its economic strength and military strength

1236
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,600
Talk about influencing the whole world

1237
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,100
what qualifies it to be

1238
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,400
When it's a second normal end, right?

1239
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,600
At that time, it meant that our 65 years ago

1240
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,500
The scene under such historical conditions

1241
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,900
is a result of receiving

1242
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,340
But does this thing say that everything remains the same forever?

1243
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,960
it will be challenged

1244
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,360
it will be challenged

1245
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,600
Let's talk like this, every time I go to see

1246
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,700
A said that the president of the World Bank will be replaced recently.

1247
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:19,840
In other words, the president of the International Monetary Fund will be replaced recently.

1248
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,760
but you always have one thing that doesn't change

1249
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,760
That is, the president of the World Bank is basically decided by the US government.

1250
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,220
So the president of the International Monetary Fund is what the European countries say

1251
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:36,260
And usually Germany and France can do it

1252
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,200
This mechanism, this tacit understanding

1253
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,800
There is no such provision

1254
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,000
but it's been around for years

1255
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,200
And so of course

1256
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,200
But if you future these two institutions

1257
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,000
when it adds value

1258
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,720
It wants MF to increase

1259
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,120
it special distribution rights

1260
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,920
time of responsibility

1261
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,600
Where does the food come from? Maybe we have to follow it again, right?

1262
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,440
Of course, I used to talk to Japan often.

1263
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,400
Japan is always very generous and desperately rich

1264
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,200
Of course I will talk to Zhong Daguo in the future

1265
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,200
Will talk to Russia

1266
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,400
Can talk to these other new England

1267
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,700
But other people can't get to the table yet, can they?

1268
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,600
there is no place for them at that main table

1269
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,400
So basically it's saying

1270
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,600
you can see this

1271
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,200
His slogan depends on what he puts forward

1272
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,800
He said he wanted to build a fairer

1273
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,600
A fairer, more inclusive and orderly world

1274
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,000
currency financial machine

1275
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,200
In fact, every word of this is criticizing the United States.

1276
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,800
In other words, your current system is

1277
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,200
unfair injustice intolerant

1278
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,600
often out of order

1279
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,600
that's what it means

1280
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,000
A lot of things have to be looked at in reverse, right?

1281
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,100
like i said hey eleven years ago

1282
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,800
When Hu Jintao first came

1283
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,500
We want a scientific outlook on development, a harmonious society

1284
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,800
Then I say he is social and he admits that he is not harmonious

1285
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Inherit the past development strategy

1286
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,000
some places are unscientific

1287
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
This is like ignoring environmental protection

1288
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Neglecting many, many health

1289
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
In fact, what he meant was very clear.

1290
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Then add the new UK market countries and developing countries

1291
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Voice and representation in the international monetary and financial body

1292
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
And to promote settlement of trade in domestic currency

1293
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It's a welfare draw

1294
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,000
That is to say, the U.S. dollar is a store of value tool

1295
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
increasingly unbelievable

1296
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And diluting is not diluting

1297
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
because you see you used to work like hell

1298
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Right, desperately assembling, desperately manufacturing

1299
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Sell ​​to the United States, and the United States will give you dollars

1300
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
In another 20 years, we will buy things from the same dollar

1301
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
can't buy anything

1302
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Because actually form a cross depreciation

1303
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
right

1304
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
so he said yes

1305
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Can we promote in the future

1306
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
That means we use each other's national currency

1307
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
as a trade settlement mechanism

1308
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Of course, many small and medium-sized national currencies

1309
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
People don't want to keep it

1310
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
so he can't

1311
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,600
become settlement money

1312
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,200
Must be strong on both sides

1313
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,640
Compare countries with large market sizes

1314
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,320
it will become

1315
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,440
Its currency will become the currency in the bilateral trade

1316
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,600
That now looks like the most qualified currency

1317
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,880
save the renminbi

1318
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,680
very clear

1319
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,320
So now mainland China and all the major trading nations

1320
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,400
signed the exchange agreement

1321
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,640
It's about creating an adequate one

1322
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,240
Such an amount of financing

1323
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,960
When asking traders on both sides to apply for a letter of credit with the bank

1324
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,640
The bank has enough

1325
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,200
to issue letters of credit

1326
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,040
Letter of Credit in Renminbi

1327
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,040
this is what we say

1328
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,680
what is this

1329
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,400
This is actually an improvement on the existing system

1330
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:53,600
very big challenge

1331
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,200
Because if this keeps expanding

1332
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,800
the one where it really shakes the dollar

1333
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,040
exclusive

1334
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
The third level should not be underestimated

1335
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,600
absolutely not to be underestimated

1336
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,900
But I'll say it's also this

1337
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,600
Sixty years since World War II

1338
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,300
what you see

1339
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,200
Will this font appear like this

1340
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,400
I don't know yet

1341
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,200
Maybe this computer almost met me

1342
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,600
The content in that font file is different

1343
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,200
But I think it's pretty

1344
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:26,200
This is possible but it is slightly

1345
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,800
not so recognizable

1346
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,200
I especially want to say this

1347
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,600
look

1348
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Last Durban

1349
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,200
To me only our media

1350
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,300
no one reported this thing

1351
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,600
so important things are already happening

1352
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,600
In rewriting means already happening

1353
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,700
And English affects us

1354
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,400
It reached several important breakthrough consensuses

1355
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,300
I used to talk

1356
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,600
it's just talking

1357
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,900
but no concrete action

1358
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,000
act now

1359
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
in delben

1360
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The first he established a BRICS development bank

1361
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
ok what does that mean

1362
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I mean you World Bank

1363
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Okay, the United States, continue with Dokdo.

1364
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
right

1365
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You don't want us to come, right? Come and participate

1366
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And you the World Bank

1367
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
the whole set behind it

1368
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
set of economic philosophies

1369
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
or a set of markets

1370
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
this above that

1371
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
this supremacy

1372
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
we may all have an opinion

1373
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
we all have opinions

1374
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because every time he

1375
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
When going to the world to pay for money

1376
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
He said pointing at you

1377
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
say you're doing it wrong

1378
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
you have to change this first

1379
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Change it first, otherwise I won't give you the money

1380
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
many developing countries

1381
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
There are probably many, many complaints about this

1382
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
He said that since we have saved so much money in foreign exchange

1383
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
right

1384
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
we can take it out together

1385
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
make another one

1386
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
one more thing

1387
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
help many other needs

1388
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
this special financing

1389
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Medium and long-term financing

1390
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
or a preferential payment

1391
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
such a

1392
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
This reporter is the second World Bank

1393
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
right

1394
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So I say it's a different story

1395
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
this is not a

1396
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
This is not a small thing

1397
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
In particular, he wants to provide infrastructure for these countries so far

1398
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,000
In addition, he also needs to set up many peripheral reporters.

1399
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
including these countries

1400
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
he wants to be a business council

1401
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Let his business elite

1402
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
There is also an exchange of cooperation and dialogue

1403
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
equal to his periphery

1404
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
many opinions in the future

1405
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
There may be such a think tank function

1406
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
you will bring it up

1407
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
to discuss

1408
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
to seek consensus

1409
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
come and brew

1410
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Then he may have to prepare

1411
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
BRICS foreign exchange

1412
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
this repository

1413
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
In the future, this is equivalent to replacing the function of the IMF.

1414
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Because if this repository appears,

1415
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
He can serve all short

1416
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Countries that need this financing temporarily

1417
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,600
Because of its sudden shortage of foreign exchange

1418
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
It doesn't need to knock on the imf's door

1419
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,200
it can knock on this door

1420
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,800
There is money in this door

1421
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,900
I can help you with short-term financing

1422
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,000
That way there might not be another scene

1423
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,600
Everyone, I don't know if I have any impression

1424
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
2008 and 2009 global financial crisis

1425
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,600
sorry no

1426
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,000
That is 08, 09 is not right

1427
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Earlier it was this 1997, 98

1428
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,200
That Asian financial red envelope

1429
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,800
The President of France and IMF

1430
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,200
He stands next to this Suharto

1431
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,500
president of indonesia

1432
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,500
Look at an agreement he signed

1433
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:46,000
Some people say that Indonesia signed an angry

1434
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,500
It is equivalent to saying that it must be under the very strict regulation of imf

1435
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,000
Get his bailout

1436
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,200
Although many people later criticized the French president, saying

1437
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,600
Your asset is very similar to your business

1438
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,800
Or the original colonial one

1439
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,400
representative of the motherland in tradition

1440
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,600
Let's just say his body language isn't very good.

1441
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
he said sorry

1442
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,000
I have been since childhood

1443
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,600
Unknowingly, I wipe my hands in front of the pine

1444
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,600
But that counts as a bad review

1445
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,600
You may not have noticed this

1446
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,000
Recently on Internet Security Issues

1447
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,600
this buzz

1448
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,200
right

1449
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,200
The United States keeps accusing mainland China, especially the People's Liberation Army

1450
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:24,600
right

1451
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,000
possible hacker often

1452
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,000
Hacked his government website

1453
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
steal his trade secrets

1454
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Another one of America's own

1455
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,400
A software expert who works for the NSA

1456
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,000
Then go overseas to break the news

1457
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,800
Said that the United States has secret surveillance

1458
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:51,700
And it's not just a project

1459
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:54,000
there will be many, many projects

1460
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,800
so what

1461
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,200
Because in the past we all know

1462
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,800
we used to write this

1463
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,400
we say this

1464
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,000
Internet

1465
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,560
Yuming of the Internet, right?

1466
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,760
Any country has to solve the problem, right?

1467
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:11,360
Big TW vs big what big HK big what

1468
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,200
There is only one country that does not need the back, and that is the United States

1469
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,060
That means it's mine, right?

1470
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:21,200
The rest of you are after me

1471
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,200
So why the international code

1472
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,440
What about the international codes International codes for all countries

1473
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,360
It's two or three digits, right?

1474
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,760
Only the United States is a pair, right?

1475
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,720
it's me

1476
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,360
This means that

1477
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,160
That's what we used to say the team didn't ask

1478
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,520
why is that right?

1479
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,400
we take it for granted

1480
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,000
That's it, that's the way the world is

1481
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,960
our this

1482
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,920
It seems that after the world popped out of the stone

1483
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:42,360
like this

1484
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,400
of course we get used to it

1485
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,920
we got used to it

1486
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:47,720
No one asked what it meant

1487
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,520
The same is true in the world of the Internet today.

1488
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,560
all the management mechanisms it started with

1489
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:57,260
Including Yuming to decide how to distribute it, right?

1490
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:58,720
by a committee

1491
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,080
on the committee with the U.S. in leading

1492
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
So the BRICS countries have now realized that

1493
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
In this case, in the future this will be a

1494
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
lifeblood more than anything else

1495
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Right, in a knowledge economy, right?

1496
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
In terms of information society

1497
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
One day you said this network was shut down

1498
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
got it

1499
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Or something I gave away

1500
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
The other party said it was strange that some things could not be received.

1501
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
this is also terrible

1502
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
very scary

1503
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
today we all know

1504
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's easy to punish a young man now

1505
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Mom and Dad said I won't allow you to surf the Internet for three hours

1506
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Coby

1507
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I used to say how much I deducted from pocket money, right?

1508
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
punish you for washing dishes

1509
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
This used to be like this, the punishment was very severe

1510
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
punishment is easy now

1511
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
i turn off the internet

1512
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
phone confiscated

1513
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
young people are simply

1514
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
it's just blowing my head

1515
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
That means how important it is to be online, right?

1516
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
How important is network security

1517
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
The BRIC countries also spoke and said

1518
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Today, the basic framework of the entire Internet world and stock prices are managed by the United States.

1519
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It can also be said that he is in control

1520
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
right

1521
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
what are we

1522
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
We have to come up with our own set

1523
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
It's not that he doesn't want to use existing

1524
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
It's just that I always have a second set.

1525
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I have to say when I need

1526
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
i have a reserve

1527
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
right

1528
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Tell me this is BRICS light blue

1529
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Don't think that this resolution will come soon after it is made.

1530
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Started in 2004

1531
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It will start in the middle of 2005

1532
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Coming from Vladivostok

1533
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Shanghai Singapore

1534
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Qingnan

1535
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Mauricius

1536
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Cape Town

1537
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
cape of good hope

1538
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
to brazil

1539
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
to Miami

1540
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Of course, he also wants to communicate with the current main thing.

1541
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But this one is managed by himself

1542
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,540
in this field

1543
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,820
America is coming

1544
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,620
That is to say, to monitor in the middle

1545
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:08,460
Or this interception is more difficult

1546
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:09,460
more difficult

1547
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,840
Then the global order changes like this

1548
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,420
That East Asia is our closest

1549
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,460
I think it's also a

1550
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,260
very worthy of our attention

1551
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,780
what will happen to it

1552
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,380
My personal judgment is this

1553
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:27,660
some time in the future

1554
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:32,780
China and India will be truckloaders of major economic growth

1555
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,080
East Asian countries will also reduce

1556
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,620
so-called lower relative

1557
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,380
not saying it's not important

1558
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,440
That is to say, they are lower than the difference

1559
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,220
Reliance on the United States and Europe

1560
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:47,120
that would strengthen other economic partnerships

1561
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,700
I'm thinking that it's because most of you here today are parents.

1562
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,240
Even a housewife

1563
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,540
Of course we are very concerned about our next generation

1564
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:55,300
right

1565
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,580
What kind of world will our next generation face?

1566
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,060
what kind of opportunities does it face

1567
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
What kind of challenges do you face

1568
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Of course, if our parents said

1569
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
good economic conditions

1570
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
total hope to put him

1571
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
put him as much as possible

1572
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
various conditions put him

1573
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
train well, right?

1574
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
summer vacation

1575
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
before studying abroad

1576
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Let's go study first, right?

1577
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Send to Cambridge

1578
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
sent to oxford

1579
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Although not Denden Cambridge

1580
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I did that study tour

1581
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
But at least I visited the campus

1582
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
right

1583
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Then learn some English by the side

1584
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Even if it is a study tour in Campbridge

1585
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
to the US, right?

1586
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
what class what class

1587
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
wait

1588
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Of course we all want him to be fine, right?

1589
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
do a good job in english

1590
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
international knowledge

1591
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
have

1592
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
then know how

1593
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Can interact with this foreigner

1594
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
allow him to be in

1595
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
on the big stage

1596
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
were able

1597
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
were able

1598
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
were able

1599
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
room for development

1600
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
if my parents

1601
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
To prepare my child's words today

1602
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
these may

1603
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,840
still need

1604
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,360
because music may have been a long time ago

1605
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,000
It is also the most important communication in an international community

1606
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,800
Today people in Central Asian countries sit

1607
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,640
I am still holding an international conference today

1608
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,440
right

1609
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,880
Obviously from Korea

1610
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,920
Obviously from Malaysia

1611
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,320
Obviously from Thailand

1612
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,760
we still talk with music

1613
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,960
this short time won't change

1614
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,080
But what?

1615
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,440
but what kind of music calendar do you need

1616
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,160
what kind of

1617
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,560
to different places

1618
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,480
its culture

1619
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,200
its geography

1620
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,160
its historical knowledge

1621
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,840
Then we feel that we can't just look at the United States.

1622
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,120
Can't just look at Europe

1623
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,400
I'll definitely be sorry

1624
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,360
because I am

1625
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,960
The endless family of former dim sum

1626
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,640
terribly sorry

1627
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,320
I don't have real kids to raise

1628
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,280
But if I have kids to raise

1629
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,600
I will definitely take it

1630
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,160
if able

1631
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,400
I would say you go to India and volunteer for me

1632
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,000
OK

1633
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,400
you go to indonesia

1634
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,800
bigger if you dare

1635
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,000
go to brazil

1636
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
go to africa

1637
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Why

1638
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Because these places are against Taiwan

1639
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
will become more and more important in the future

1640
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Or even if you develop

1641
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Maybe not developed in Taiwan

1642
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
you may develop anywhere

1643
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
You may be for a company in the future

1644
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Company may be in Singapore

1645
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
may be where

1646
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
but it's likely your business

1647
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
to contact these countries

1648
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
because it's a very, very important

1649
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
future economic growth

1650
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
that power source

1651
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
In other words, we also need to pay attention to a lot

1652
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Some of the things we were less familiar with in the past

1653
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
some kind of economic geography

1654
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
a change in some phenomenon

1655
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
because we used to say

1656
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
We are Ocean Nation

1657
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The ocean is the entire modern human

1658
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
cradle of civilization blah blah blah blah

1659
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
but i want to tell you

1660
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
In fact, the world has lived in many different historical periods

1661
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Its development is often not quite like this

1662
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
We started from the Tang Dynasty when we were young

1663
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,460
send more obvious

1664
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,420
The importance of thinking on the road

1665
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:06,080
Never less than any sea thought

1666
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,120
its a big one as something

1667
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,540
One can be said to be one big one artery

1668
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:15,420
Economic Cultural Religious

1669
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,540
two important arteries

1670
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,200
Of course, for various reasons

1671
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:22,200
Of course, this also includes nautical technology.

1672
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,200
Soil leaps and bounds

1673
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:27,000
So what we are used to

1674
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,700
This passage at sea, right?

1675
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:34,200
As the most important economic lifeline of any country

1676
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,000
But in the future we might notice

1677
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,780
There are many new developments

1678
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,540
including now

1679
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,900
China and Australia are dominating the pan-pressure rail system

1680
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,540
This is an area we are very unfamiliar with

1681
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,200
And through some countries we are not familiar with

1682
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,800
I know that I read English very well.

1683
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,500
this rao kou in english

1684
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:55,900
all behind stan stan

1685
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:58,000
Many countries in Central Asia

1686
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,800
but he

1687
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,760
You may become an accelerator of the regional economy

1688
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,840
Can not be ignored

1689
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
Can not be ignored

1690
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,840
absolutely not to be ignored

1691
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:12,840
Well, I'm going to give you a very good resume now.

1692
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,800
It was recently opened for test drive.

1693
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:25,640
Just take a train from Chengdu

1694
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,640
pull hundreds of containers

1695
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,640
hundreds of containers

1696
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,880
it can go to europe in one go

1697
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:34,520
to poland

1698
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:38,180
and then on to the European rail system

1699
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,900
Then this one is called Rong Ou

1700
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,080
Rong is the abbreviation of Chengdu.

1701
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,080
this fast rail cargo

1702
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,100
this route

1703
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,640
Depart from Chengdu

1704
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,340
12 days to reach Poland

1705
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:55,080
and then on to the European rail system

1706
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,080
but it knows

1707
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,000
If you want to pull a container from Chengdu

1708
01:09:59,000 --> 01:09:59,960
all the way to the Yangtze River

1709
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Or take the road to the exit in Guangxi

1710
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Then go to Southeast Asia, Malacca, the Straits, and the Indian Ocean

1711
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Always come the traditional route

1712
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
to the Suez Canal, to the Mediterranean

1713
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and then on to Luther's Disaster

1714
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
like this route

1715
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It basically totals our look at

1716
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
usually 45 days

1717
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So you see how big the difference is between the two

1718
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And there may be some typhoons along this route

1719
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
What are some other walrus comparison questions?

1720
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Although the impact of walruses on giant cruise ships is not too great

1721
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
but at least that is

1722
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
In the past, it was because of the obstruction of national borders

1723
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
And it requires country-by-country customs clearance

1724
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
But now these countries have signed an agreement

1725
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
It is your container that is sealed and verified in Chengdu

1726
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
after doing this

1727
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I'll make it all the way to Europe

1728
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,200
There is no need to go through the middle

1729
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,840
Unobstructed

1730
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,840
This agreement belt is arranged

1731
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,880
In fact, it is the same as domestic transportation.

1732
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,120
Just like domestic shipping

1733
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,840
Then we also know that this is being repaired now

1734
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,960
Eurasian Railway System

1735
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,200
It is now basically going from

1736
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:18,760
this kunming

1737
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,080
pull one

1738
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,440
Ten-speed railway with more than 200 kilometers

1739
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,840
go through

1740
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,040
this liao country

1741
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,280
then to thailand

1742
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,400
then bangkok

1743
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,400
Then via Kuala Lumpur to Singapore

1744
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,640
Then Singapore and Kuala Lumpur this high current

1745
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:33,640
already

1746
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,640
It will be officially launched this year

1747
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,440
new build

1748
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,440
I said new

1749
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,760
This is all possible between ten and ten years

1750
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,040
will be fully formed

1751
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,000
Big anime on the new road

1752
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,400
big anime

1753
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,960
many in this area

1754
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,320
we trade

1755
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,320
migrant

1756
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,200
Various events will change in the future

1757
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,440
is very very substantial

1758
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,400
even unimaginable

1759
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,600
can also be said to be

1760
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Unseen changes throughout the ages

1761
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
almost

1762
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
so we often say

1763
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
In the past, it was said that it was sealed in the inland of China

1764
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's hard for you to get in and out

1765
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
punishment is difficult

1766
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
is the last difficulty

1767
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
now you can hardly imagine

1768
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Pull a container from Chengdu

1769
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
12 days to get to Polan

1770
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
look at the world

1771
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
A change to the column

1772
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
To column changes

1773
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
This will lead to countries along these lines

1774
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
or like southeast

1775
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
speed of economic integration

1776
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
will accelerate across the board

1777
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Fully accelerated

1778
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Don't look at Southeast Asia is very impressive

1779
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
This is also a big market of nearly 1 billion

1780
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
A big market with a population of 1 billion

1781
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Southeast Asia itself

1782
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
These are the populations of the countries of Indonesia

1783
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
very very impressive

1784
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And the consumption power is very, very strong

1785
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,900
In fact, this change not only occurs in

1786
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:06,000
What I just talked about is the Asia we promoted

1787
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,500
Changes like this appear in Africa and Nami at the same time

1788
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,400
Especially their trade relationship with mainland China

1789
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,000
The past 15 years have been unimaginable

1790
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,700
It's all double digits

1791
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,600
And from a very low base

1792
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,400
very very low

1793
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,300
My number hasn't been updated yet.

1794
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,200
average income

1795
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,800
The trade volume between mainland China and Africa

1796
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:35,800
That is to say, by 2011

1797
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,500
Has reached 160 billion US dollars

1798
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,900
then now is the time

1799
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:43,500
80% of Africa's trade comes from

1800
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,200
Its trade with mainland China

1801
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,300
anything else

1802
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,000
Mainland China's Net Export Bank

1803
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,200
This debt offered in this African region

1804
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,800
Between 2001 and 2011

1805
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,000
A total of 67.2 billion in this 10 years

1806
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
during this coincident period

1807
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
The World Bank provides debt in the region

1808
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Only 54.7 billion

1809
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
this change

1810
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
very very element

1811
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Well, CUHK also has a bank called China Development Bank.

1812
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
this is a very large

1813
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
very large

1814
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
A bank with a policy mandate

1815
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
total assets of the bank

1816
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
over the world bank

1817
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Asian Development Bank

1818
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
african development bank

1819
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
The total of the three major international banks

1820
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
So this bank it starts

1821
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
start now to prepare in africa

1822
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
future in latin america

1823
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
For Chinese companies in these countries

1824
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Especially with China

1825
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
with trade and investment

1826
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Chinese companies make debts

1827
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
also for the area

1828
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
some technical construction

1829
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Especially the design is called Mainland China

1830
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Its state-owned enterprises expand abroad

1831
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
This change is

1832
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
really hard to imagine

1833
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
very very hard to imagine

1834
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
even we can say

1835
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,840
long time to come

1836
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:06,800
In the middle, it has the right to speak on the entire so-called development model

1837
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,640
it may all gain a place

1838
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,000
That is to say, we have traditionally talked about the United States

1839
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,840
I say its three most important powers funded

1840
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,000
military

1841
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,600
The economy has finance as the most prominent part of it

1842
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,640
In addition, its soft power

1843
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,840
its values ​​its culture

1844
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,840
its democratic funding

1845
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,880
But now we have to pay attention to

1846
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,640
that is

1847
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,080
Mainland China's development experience in the past 30 years

1848
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:40,440
Now many other civilized countries in the world

1849
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,640
are seriously trying to understand

1850
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,240
I had a chance too

1851
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,340
There is a teacher at Xihua University in Beijing

1852
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:51,880
He said it's rare for you to come

1853
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,880
Can you come to my class and make them a

1854
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,240
Just give a half-hour, one-hour speech.

1855
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,480
He supports a foreign language class

1856
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,880
speak english and i will go

1857
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:05,880
The following 50 students are all from Africa

1858
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,440
And they are probably teachers or deputy teachers

1859
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:15,240
Extremely middle and senior officials come from every different country in Africa

1860
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:19,720
Attend classes at Tsinghua University

1861
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,240
So when we say that we often feel that

1862
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:26,160
We in Taiwan have many advantages over inclusion

1863
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,480
But but so we tend to ignore this

1864
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,920
That is to say, it actually has long-range power

1865
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:36,880
It actually has the right to speak about the so-called development model

1866
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,480
But in fact some people in the West have already seen this form

1867
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:43,080
and very sad

1868
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,520
And it thinks that not only mainland China

1869
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,480
Its development model represents a different model from that of Europe and the United States

1870
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:54,680
Moreover, it is different from the planned economy of the traditional Soviet Union.

1871
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,120
and they are a big challenge for us

1872
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,000
then of course this

1873
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,040
Do Western media like this agent magazine?

1874
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:09,040
Of course he is not willing to use this official term in mainland China itself

1875
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,040
he won't use

1876
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,040
He would not say that your system is called a socialist market economy

1877
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,040
he won't use it like this

1878
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,040
But he said you are called State Capitalism

1879
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,040
it's called state capitalism

1880
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:25,040
It means he certainly has some kind of capitalism

1881
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:30,080
An economic operation or a property right

1882
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,080
an institutional arrangement

1883
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,080
But his master is the state

1884
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:39,080
Of course, using this term in this way is also appropriate to a certain extent.

1885
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,080
that is

1886
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:43,080
Because to this day, to maintain the mainstay of China's economy

1887
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,080
Is a state-owned enterprise

1888
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,080
Russia's economic cadres are also state-owned enterprises

1889
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:54,080
including many, many emerging market countries

1890
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,120
also have this trend

1891
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,120
and also very special

1892
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
After 2008 and 2009

1893
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Speaking of the state's desire to expand its intervention in economic activity

1894
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
or even it

1895
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
when necessary

1896
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It should be a state enterprise

1897
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
That is to say, key industries

1898
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
key financial sectors

1899
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
its owner

1900
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
this already

1901
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
It is no longer an idea that is considered completely outdated

1902
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Because this whole debate on this issue

1903
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Already migrated

1904
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
before this

1905
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
It just feels like this is

1906
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
This is something that was backward before the 60s

1907
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
not worth mentioning at all

1908
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But after 2008 and 2009

1909
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
this whole debate

1910
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
We say the whole frame of mind inside has changed

1911
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
why is it simple

1912
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Because the U.S. government has accepted

1913
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Both received AIG

1914
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
The U.S. government also took over General Motors

1915
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
But then its key also says

1916
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I receive short term

1917
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
So I will slowly return it to you to a certain extent

1918
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
but it also knows

1919
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
it does not accept the spot

1920
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
bankruptcy

1921
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,300
pair liquidation

1922
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,300
OK

1923
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,400
Because he can't help himself

1924
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,300
Get his in this financial institution

1925
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,100
the financing he needs

1926
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,800
Then only the state is a guarantor

1927
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,100
then no problem

1928
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:15,200
no problem with the guarantor

1929
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,300
So it can be said that

1930
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:20,100
We say that the post-war Western countries provided

1931
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:23,400
This political economy model has two options

1932
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,100
There is a great deal of commonality between schools

1933
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,300
But he still has his own characteristics

1934
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:28,800
One is American Capitalism

1935
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,600
American political capitalism

1936
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,660
In addition, this European welfare state

1937
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:36,500
secondly

1938
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,400
American capitalism

1939
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:42,100
Of course, more emphasis is placed on the responsibility of the individual himself.

1940
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,300
state intervention in economic activities

1941
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,800
minimize as much as possible

1942
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,200
And to give the enterprise the greatest space

1943
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,800
And the business is completely down on profit

1944
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,600
Or with shareholder equity as one of his most important

1945
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,300
this one goal

1946
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:58,600
The Welfare State of Western Europe

1947
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,600
then compromise

1948
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,680
He said that the state still has to intervene in this private economy

1949
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,720
intervention in the market economy

1950
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,080
Guaranteed means that if the group

1951
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,880
Then he has a certain chance of economic participation

1952
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,600
and then get some guarantee

1953
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,560
It is necessary to say that the government can carry out

1954
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,200
Through taxes and this social welfare

1955
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:20,080
do a sort of real second assignment

1956
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,320
but anyway

1957
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,800
Now it seems that means

1958
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,160
The model of the West Lake welfare state now faces serious challenges

1959
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,680
It can even reach the stage of a broken clean

1960
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,360
because it

1961
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,800
Because the financial crisis keeps getting worse

1962
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,840
And the worse the economy

1963
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,960
The greater the number of social welfare needs

1964
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,320
But less revenue

1965
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,760
So between these two

1966
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,720
This chasm keeps widening

1967
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,880
how does it maintain it

1968
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,440
American capitalism also thinks one of its

1969
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:53,640
a strong and favorable attraction

1970
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,560
past words say

1971
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,920
Any of your textbooks open to manage the college

1972
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,000
best case study

1973
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,160
Harvard Bench School

1974
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,800
G is the best

1975
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,300
3M best

1976
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,160
what's best

1977
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:07,240
are all american

1978
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,040
Glomensex best

1979
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:12,000
If you graduated from Princeton before

1980
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,160
or graduated

1981
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,460
you say i found a job

1982
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:14,840
Where

1983
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,560
Leanman Brothers

1984
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,560
Wow

1985
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,200
Xie Meng, you are incredible

1986
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,300
soon what

1987
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,960
just put on a golden hat

1988
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,500
Leanman Brothers any secretary

1989
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,340
Dividends in the middle of the year are very impressive

1990
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:27,140
than any professor in National Taiwan University

1991
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:29,200
Manager is even better

1992
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:29,960
incredible

1993
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,320
Able to go to Leanman Brothers

1994
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,000
Who thought Leanman Brothers could go out of business

1995
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,320
no one imagined

1996
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,200
right

1997
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,520
no one can imagine

1998
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,960
So that means

1999
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,520
the two modes

2000
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,320
at least definitely not one

2001
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,760
can for its original

2002
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:50,260
This exemplary

2003
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:53,120
The role of indicators

2004
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,120
Of course, The Executive Magazine is also very worried.

2005
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,320
just feel like saying

2006
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,080
A new model for a new country

2007
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
its mode it uses a bucket

2008
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,400
A bucket should come down from our bag

2009
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,200
state capitalism

2010
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,400
and it

2011
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,200
Capitalism in this country is not what it used to be

2012
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,600
Previously these economies were closed

2013
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,100
right

2014
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,000
You engage in a planned economy internally

2015
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:14,400
right

2016
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,500
Or engage in state-owned economy

2017
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,600
engage in a socialist economy

2018
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,400
that has nothing to do with me

2019
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:18,600
right

2020
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,200
no interaction between us

2021
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,800
Not too many intersection sets

2022
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,200
but now it's different

2023
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,700
These state-owned capital in the world market

2024
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:28,600
Acquisition of industries in other countries

2025
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,100
right

2026
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,700
Acquisition of core technology

2027
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:34,100
and then into a lot of the West that used to be completely

2028
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:38,700
Monopoly industry

2029
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,100
So this kind of purchasing country is terrible

2030
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:40,900
say nervously

2031
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:41,500
oh

2032
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,300
This is unfair competition

2033
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:46,100
There is a big boss behind these state-owned enterprises

2034
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:46,700
right

2035
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,300
Its financing cost is so low

2036
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,500
State Guarantee

2037
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:49,700
right

2038
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:50,900
And the state can also subsidize it.

2039
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,100
anything is fine

2040
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,900
how do i compete with it

2041
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,900
I also want to pay dividends to me every year

2042
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,300
this

2043
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,700
And the dividends of my business managers are also great.

2044
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,500
right

2045
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,100
I this time

2046
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,600
How can you compete with him?

2047
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,100
right

2048
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:02,900
so start talking

2049
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,100
We have to make new rules of the game

2050
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,400
Is it possible to allow this new enterprise

2051
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,000
Can casually like any other private enterprise

2052
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,100
Search and purchase Cross-border investment

2053
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,400
do this do that

2054
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,800
so say

2055
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:15,900
in two different worlds

2056
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,300
when it starts to go bordering

2057
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,300
when friction occurs

2058
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:26,900
All these conflicts will arise

2059
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,200
so

2060
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,600
but we must also say

2061
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,000
the world is like this

2062
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,500
in a process of restructuring

2063
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,800
restructuring process

2064
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,000
then we have to find out

2065
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:38,900
to understand

2066
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:39,900
to learn about it

2067
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:41,000
its possible movement

2068
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
possible trend

2069
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Yesterday I was going to emphasize to everyone that

2070
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,400
Our own kind of international society and

2071
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,500
an international perspective

2072
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,100
that is

2073
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:54,300
my suggestion is

2074
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,500
Our mentality needs to be adjusted

2075
01:23:56,500 --> 01:23:57,400
ok we adjust now

2076
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,900
that is to say we used to

2077
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,900
that is

2078
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I am very accustomed to the so-called Western-centric thinking

2079
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,600
Maybe we're going to slowly develop a

2080
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:14,000
Moreover, the so-called benchmark of progress and backwardness in our past history

2081
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
Think it's an easy bridge

2082
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,000
right

2083
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,000
It is closer to the model of the United States and Japan

2084
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,800
Or the Western European model is progress

2085
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,800
The farther you get from it, the more you fall behind

2086
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,700
possible maps of these cognitions

2087
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,800
These guidelines may all need some tweaking

2088
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,000
Then we might have to learn how to reintegrate into Asia

2089
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,200
We often forget that we are part of Asia

2090
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,000
we are part of east asia

2091
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,600
That's why I said we send the kids to Campbridge as soon as we drop them off

2092
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,000
right

2093
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,800
Send it to Harvard

2094
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,000
Did you forget to say whether he should join

2095
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,600
go to singapore for a while

2096
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,400
Stay in Shanghai, stay in Gargada

2097
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,600
We may not have such a thinking in the past

2098
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:59,200
I just said we need to reconnect the non-Western world

2099
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,000
East Asia

2100
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
South Asia Central Asia Middle East Latin America Africa

2101
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
of course we are worried

2102
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Why

2103
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
our language

2104
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
our side

2105
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Basic knowledge of history, politics and culture

2106
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
where are our thoughts

2107
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
right

2108
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
it's a big challenge

2109
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
when you start this challenge

2110
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
You said I am Hongda Dian, I am going

2111
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
India opens up the market

2112
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
who do i send

2113
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I think it's actually very simple

2114
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
we need to change our mentality

2115
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Why

2116
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
let's say yes

2117
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Our Home Chinese School International Graduate School

2118
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
what do i recruit

2119
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
from india

2120
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
A lot of recruits from Brazil

2121
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Tsinghua University now has

2122
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Hundreds of students from India

2123
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
But our mentality is still closed

2124
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
We agreed that you should go back as soon as you graduate

2125
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
don't come and take my job

2126
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
OK

2127
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
In the future, we will just turn our minds around

2128
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It will be my sidekick from now on

2129
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
It graduated from Tsinghua University in Hsinchu

2130
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I agree with it in the five-year period, the three-year period

2131
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
right

2132
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,280
Do it with Acer

2133
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,080
He will help this Hongda store

2134
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,280
he does it for him

2135
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,240
learn his own business

2136
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,600
his organizational culture

2137
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:08,200
right

2138
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:08,880
Then what

2139
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,440
I can send him back naturally

2140
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:11,760
right

2141
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,200
Do I want to open up with India in the future

2142
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,240
Excellent cadres in the market

2143
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,920
so many of our own

2144
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,280
And we have so many foreign brides

2145
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,720
What about Vietnam?

2146
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,600
There are a few Indonesians

2147
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:27,800
Thailand

2148
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,680
In fact, behind them

2149
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,080
their social context

2150
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,200
right

2151
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:36,240
These are the things Taiwan will use in the future

2152
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:37,040
we've been worried about saying

2153
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:37,400
oops

2154
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,920
How do they fit in?

2155
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,600
what is this society

2156
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,760
It's a question of education

2157
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,920
many things have two sides

2158
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:45,880
he has two faces

2159
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,560
In other words, he can actually bring a

2160
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,280
a new possibility

2161
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,160
possibility

2162
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:51,840
what about the end

2163
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,960
I want to share with you a

2164
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,760
a simple historical

2165
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,400
a statistic

2166
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,040
this stat

2167
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,940
So it doesn't mean that there must be some theorem or law behind it

2168
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:06,440
not necessarily

2169
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:11,360
Of course, it’s just to say that let’s open the whole frame of our thinking.

2170
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,960
One pull will pull 1000 years One pull will pull 2000 years

2171
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,120
Or at least pull 600 years to see the world

2172
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,720
so that we don't put all our thinking

2173
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:23,240
Only limited to 65 years of post-war people

2174
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:32,280
This is a famous Dutch economist who just passed away

2175
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,760
Oakes Madison

2176
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,160
his team

2177
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:42,160
It took a lot of time for the manager to build a very large database

2178
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:46,280
They hope to use a calculation formula equivalent to the purchase land

2179
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:50,840
To estimate each country or each region in different historical periods

2180
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,840
his standard of living

2181
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,600
Of course he expressed it in terms of GDP

2182
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,680
or GDP

2183
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,640
per capita

2184
01:27:58,640 --> 01:27:59,680
or

2185
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,400
Of course per capita can of course calculate that country

2186
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,400
This planting in that area

2187
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,900
When this calculation method is estimated in many ways

2188
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,400
It must be seen from some historical records

2189
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:10,900
right

2190
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,900
At that time, a typical average root farmer

2191
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,900
How much meat can it eat in a year

2192
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,400
how much food

2193
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,900
it can sew several suits

2194
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:24,100
Which basics are used for its living environment

2195
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:25,500
What kind of structure is it probably

2196
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,400
what kind of space

2197
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,400
to promote its standard of living

2198
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,000
Of course, if there is some tax information

2199
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,600
it can make better estimates

2200
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,000
Etc., etc

2201
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,200
Altogether this estimate builds a huge database

2202
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:44,000
It builds a purchasing power equivalent of 2,000 years of world economic history

2203
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,800
Then in different historical periods

2204
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,600
every country

2205
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,800
Its current country is still calculated according to the scope of our modern country

2206
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:52,200
For example, China takes the scope of China

2207
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,400
of course that means

2208
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,600
But this range means

2209
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,600
It sometimes shrinks at different times

2210
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:56,800
right

2211
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,600
If you want to send grass, it will be reduced, right?

2212
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,600
it will

2213
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
continuity

2214
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
All in all we say let's see the world

2215
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
two thousand years ago

2216
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,000
In today's space in China

2217
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
At that time, if the world GDP

2218
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Deduct some of this from the total

2219
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
small and medium developed country

2220
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Because they were not occupied in any historical period

2221
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
an important proportion

2222
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
It is important that these countries

2223
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:31,000
China India Japan USA France Germany Italy UK

2224
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
U.K.

2225
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Then we can see that

2226
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
two thousand years ago

2227
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
India is actually a very early

2228
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Compared to other civilizations at the time

2229
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
is highly developed

2230
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Its agricultural productivity is quite high

2231
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And it also has a lot of medicine, mathematics, etc.

2232
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
those those

2233
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
It was relatively advanced at the time

2234
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So it was in the GDP of the world at that time

2235
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Proportion

2236
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,440
technology is also great

2237
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,940
It's very big

2238
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:04,160
you see how much it takes

2239
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,840
This one grid is 10%

2240
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:09,240
1/1 over

2241
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:11,840
very very big

2242
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,240
When these countries add up

2243
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,440
Are more than 60% of the world

2244
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,240
All other countries and territories combined

2245
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,640
Actually less than 40%

2246
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,500
then let's look at china

2247
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,600
This moderator is a change inside

2248
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,840
it also speaks for a long time

2249
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,240
It can basically account for 1/4

2250
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:38,640
It is equivalent to its ratio among the population of the world at that time

2251
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:39,140
actually very close

2252
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,000
sometimes a little higher

2253
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,640
That is, its total volume will be higher than its population ratio

2254
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:45,140
because of its agricultural productivity

2255
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:47,040
Still more advanced than many countries

2256
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,840
That is to say, its more intensive farming

2257
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,300
then irrigate and so on

2258
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,540
Of course there are other techniques

2259
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:53,640
Astronomical

2260
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:56,400
and medical

2261
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,940
then we keep watching

2262
01:30:58,940 --> 01:30:59,980
to this 18

2263
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,160
20 This is just a time for celebration

2264
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,040
when celebrating

2265
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,880
At that time, India had already started to experience

2266
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,920
Holland and Portugal

2267
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,400
partial colonial occupation

2268
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,240
it begins to shrink point by point

2269
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:19,400
At that time, China was still very high in the world

2270
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,440
Don't forget that this is only 20 years from the Opium War

2271
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,000
Next, history is about to enter a

2272
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,280
another new cycle

2273
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:33,680
Next, many other regions or countries rapidly overtake

2274
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:36,080
rapid growth

2275
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,680
Europe Britain from the mid-eighteenth century onwards

2276
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:43,280
In fact, the Industrial Revolution spread to the whole of Western Europe.

2277
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,480
America is special, right?

2278
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:47,160
There were only thirteen states in the United States

2279
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:51,480
It grew from the original insignificant

2280
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:53,360
The eighteenth century was an insignificant one

2281
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,440
An economic sector of the world

2282
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,640
In the nineteenth century before the American Civil War

2283
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,240
also started at

2284
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Now there is a wave

2285
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
far inferior to other major European countries at the time

2286
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
But after the civil war ended

2287
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
The United States began to catch up with European industrialization in an all-round way

2288
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And finally the battle of Issgard

2289
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,000
From 1940 to the 1970s

2290
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
This time is the highest peak in the United States

2291
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
In the economic map of the world

2292
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
it's a love day

2293
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
This is a long history

2294
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
At that time, we can see more carefully

2295
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
At this time in 1820 just mentioned

2296
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
when celebrating

2297
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
This is from 1500 to 2000

2298
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Everyone can see and say

2299
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:47,000
China since the postwar

2300
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
until 1970

2301
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
In fact, the proportion is still increasing very slowly.

2302
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
But then the rapid economic development

2303
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
After 2000 it has taken full advantage

2304
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,500
The proportion of global GDP has reached 12

2305
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,700
Of course, its population is still some distance away, right?

2306
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,100
It is close to more than one-fifth of the population

2307
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,700
less than a quarter

2308
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:13,800
India is slowly recovering

2309
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,000
Latin America is also slowly growing

2310
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,400
Europe is slowly shrinking

2311
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,800
Relative specific gravity

2312
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,100
Relative specific gravity

2313
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,600
This is OECD

2314
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,100
That is to say, those industrial cash countries

2315
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:31,800
an international organization

2316
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,500
OECD it to combine

2317
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,200
Relevant materials of many international organizations

2318
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,100
including the World Bank's

2319
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,900
and other international organizations

2320
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,600
then at the end of last year

2321
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,400
made a future estimate

2322
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,500
Just based on the picture I just made

2323
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,000
Because it was 2000 before that picture

2324
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,900
Just this first year a few years ago

2325
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,840
Therefore, in 2011, the world's fine plate

2326
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,760
CUHK has accounted for 17%

2327
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,000
This is a first class value purchase

2328
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,760
This is not the name of the national

2329
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,560
gross domestic product

2330
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,360
The United States is 23%

2331
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:18,440
Then the euro area is 17%

2332
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,760
other high income

2333
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,080
to developed countries

2334
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,640
countries like South Korea

2335
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:29,440
is 18%

2336
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,760
other developing countries

2337
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,040
this estimate

2338
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,800
This estimate is not provided by me

2339
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:35,760
I said OECD

2340
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:36,920
And this estimate

2341
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,560
In fact whether you go to see

2342
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,480
The Economist's most recent estimates

2343
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,080
or american country

2344
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,000
own national security

2345
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,320
international intelligence

2346
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,840
national intelligence agency

2347
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,560
what it does

2348
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,440
The medium and constant development area in the future of the world is

2349
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,520
The data are almost the same

2350
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,680
when it says

2351
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,000
There will be no big wars in the future

2352
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,160
An unimaginable whole

2353
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,300
Ecological crisis assumes that these rule out

2354
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:06,900
or a great upheaval without great politics

2355
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:10,740
Then, with the current trend of development,

2356
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:15,340
China's Purchasing Power Regulation Machine in 2003

2357
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:16,900
will account for 28% of the world

2358
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:20,620
Relatively speaking, the United States will shrink a little

2359
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:21,580
reduced to 18%

2360
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:22,260
still big

2361
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:27,260
Because its population at that time was only more than 300 million

2362
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,260
India will continue to grow

2363
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:31,260
India will grow to 11%

2364
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,260
Eurozone will continue to shrink

2365
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,260
17% becomes 12%

2366
01:35:35,260 --> 01:35:36,260
India

2367
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:37,260
sorry

2368
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,260
Japan will continue to shrink

2369
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:40,260
relatively

2370
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:41,260
relatively

2371
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:43,260
it may be close to zero growth

2372
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,260
Mainland China may average

2373
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:47,260
Nearly 6.5 to 7% growth

2374
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:49,260
When it is 2060, just refer to it

2375
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:51,260
because of this

2376
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:54,260
I just said that social science needs to make long-term estimates

2377
01:35:54,260 --> 01:35:55,260
not necessarily reliable

2378
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:57,260
So by 2030 it will be

2379
01:35:57,260 --> 01:35:59,260
Probably can also refer to

2380
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,260
right

2381
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,800
2006 is more difficult to say

2382
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,480
But we have to think about it this way

2383
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:10,180
The world we used to know is this world

2384
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:15,480
Such a structure of the world economic map in 1950

2385
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:16,780
Let's say this structure is right

2386
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:22,520
The United States and Europe together make up half the sky

2387
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:23,660
So of course it's not surprising

2388
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:26,820
MF are all Europeans as presidents

2389
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:28,860
World Bank Says American as President

2390
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:30,260
It's only natural, right?

2391
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:33,260
I'm the major shareholder, right?

2392
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:35,320
But let's say it the other way around

2393
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,960
When the world becomes like this

2394
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,300
Will it still be that we are familiar with this world

2395
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:46,300
unlikely impossible impossible

2396
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:48,540
But is this likely to happen?

2397
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,500
i think it's likely to happen

2398
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:53,080
Why is it actually so simple

2399
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,280
That is to say, many, many different countries

2400
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,380
different society

2401
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:00,000
say his personal you say

2402
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
From a genetic point of view

2403
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
its smart material

2404
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
no difference that much

2405
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Indians are so smart

2406
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
right

2407
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Etc., etc

2408
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
You only have a chance to have political stability for a while

2409
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
political stability

2410
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,000
no war

2411
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Then start doing some basic construction

2412
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Then start learning to catch up

2413
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
learning and catching up

2414
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
learning at first

2415
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
learn to improve

2416
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
right

2417
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
But it has a latecomer advantage

2418
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
it doesn't need anything

2419
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
because you talk

2420
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You don't have to reinvent the wheel

2421
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
You do not need

2422
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
That is to say, you are now crossing the border into the 21st century

2423
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
You learn first as soon as you learn

2424
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
You can omit the steps in the middle

2425
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
This is called digging learning

2426
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And it's low base

2427
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And its people are still in this

2428
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Very shameful and hardworking

2429
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
very diligent stage

2430
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
right

2431
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
you are in europe

2432
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
french people work a week

2433
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
thirty three hours

2434
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,640
35 hours

2435
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:05,000
At least four weeks of vacation a year

2436
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,240
If you go to France in July or August, just say

2437
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,440
sorry you can't find anyone

2438
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:14,000
are on vacation

2439
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,360
That is to say, it doesn't matter if it's France or Germany.

2440
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,960
Spain is fine, if it is the whole world

2441
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,920
Let’s talk about this field, such as making medical equipment

2442
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:22,680
only i can do it

2443
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,200
and i can sell you expensive

2444
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,560
only i can do it

2445
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,400
Medicine only I know

2446
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,480
And I protected myself with a patent for 30 years

2447
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,240
Your heart bets on cars, you can only eat me

2448
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:36,200
I have 300 yuan a piece and you have to eat it too

2449
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:39,360
If this advantage gradually disappears

2450
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,880
Is it possible for you to maintain that standard of living?

2451
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,560
impossible

2452
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:46,720
impossible

2453
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:47,480
so the world

2454
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,240
In fact, the human world

2455
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,120
you can tell

2456
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:52,440
past world

2457
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,640
in most cases

2458
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,120
that is to say a regional country

2459
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,040
it experiences specific gravity in the world

2460
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,160
relative to its population

2461
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Even though I'm more productive than you

2462
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Can be 20% higher 30% 50%

2463
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
that's already amazing

2464
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
There have never been almost few people in a certain era

2465
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
say it's like 1950

2466
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,000
the productivity of public servants in the United States

2467
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
It may be 30 times that of a certain country

2468
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
50 times

2469
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
This is rare in history

2470
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
It should be said that it is very delicious

2471
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It is most likely a transitional phenomenon

2472
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It means that others will learn and feel

2473
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
You have nothing unique

2474
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
people will never learn

2475
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
No

2476
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Actually there is no such thing

2477
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
So our world is like this

2478
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I'm not born to say that I can enjoy something to myself

2479
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So I'm on the spot with us

2480
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Because I am in the dormitory of National Taiwan University

2481
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Graduates told me that you have to think about it

2482
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
you will compete in the future

2483
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
It's not that Taiwan University wants to compete with Chen University

2484
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Chen Da wants to compete with this Zhongshan

2485
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
No, I said you want to follow

2486
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Graduated from Tsinghua University in Beijing Graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University

2487
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,400
Graduated, right?

2488
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:03,400
The Singapore Nanyang Technological Institute

2489
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:05,800
promoted with his graduates

2490
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,800
Also follow India's preference for engineering colleges

2491
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,200
have to

2492
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,700
Where should I put my Acer R&D?

2493
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:12,100
right

2494
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:14,000
my new one this

2495
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
this iphone

2496
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
this

2497
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,100
application software

2498
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,900
Where should I put my development

2499
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,600
I didn't put Taipei like this

2500
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:23,900
right

2501
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,000
which professional is better

2502
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,100
good working attitude

2503
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:29,800
Strong team spirit

2504
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,800
New words may be second

2505
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,800
probably second

2506
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,800
So what we're saying is to have a

2507
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,000
cognition makes a

2508
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,400
such a state of mind

2509
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,200
such a mentality

2510
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,500
it could be us

2511
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:41,500
going to

2512
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,500
adapting to a new thing

2513
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,000
ok i report today

2514
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,300
it will take a lot of time to get here

2515
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:49,300
Thanks

2516
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,600
Thank you, Academician, for this wonderful speech

2517
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:58,500
then we still have

2518
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,160
Fuyuan City must very much hope that everyone will come to discuss

2519
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:07,400
We're open for discussion

2520
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,400
so to

2521
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,900
has anyone started

2522
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,700
Ask a question

2523
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:20,900
The vice president here

2524
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:24,300
just sit down and press that light

2525
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:25,900
right

2526
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,200
Vice President and that

2527
01:41:29,900 --> 01:41:30,500
that is

2528
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,200
I just introduce myself first

2529
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,100
So I work here in the advertising industry.

2530
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:37,500
and then just normally

2531
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:40,600
If you are interested in international relations, you will read

2532
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,200
Well, I have a test today.

2533
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:45,700
Just look at it and share it here with Mr. Zhu

2534
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,300
in the third world

2535
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:50,300
It may be the part that may rise in the future world

2536
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:53,200
Then I have a question here, that is

2537
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,300
If analyzed in terms of Marxism

2538
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,900
dependency theory

2539
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:59,500
and then say

2540
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,600
He gave an example like going to the company

2541
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:05,360
Then some of what he sells today are cocoa powder

2542
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,400
or some drinks

2543
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:09,560
some tea bags

2544
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,560
Then maybe his primitives

2545
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,400
Materials are imported from Central America

2546
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,440
but he

2547
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:14,960
If it is 100 yuan of tea bags

2548
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,360
He might be five bucks

2549
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,040
come and buy with them

2550
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:19,240
Then after a while

2551
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:20,240
just keep on streaming

2552
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:22,560
to these countries in the third world

2553
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,160
Over the past few years

2554
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,560
Since the world is about to gradually rise

2555
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,920
Then these to develop the country

2556
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,880
It is bound to not want them here

2557
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:31,960
just do rise

2558
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:33,440
will definitely do some

2559
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,720
some bills

2560
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,840
or some

2561
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:36,720
do it

2562
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,440
boycott their behavior

2563
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,920
Yes, that's the first point

2564
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,280
May do boycott of their behavior

2565
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:42,520
The second point is to

2566
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:44,120
in italian terms

2567
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,680
they may also be

2568
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,920
The more responsible the poorer the poorer

2569
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,240
Then after a while

2570
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:50,680
That too

2571
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,880
For the third world

2572
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:53,640
It is also more difficult to break through

2573
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:54,920
I don't know about that

2574
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,160
just what happened recently

2575
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,200
Let's get some views like this

2576
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
answer one by one

2577
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
good

2578
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
OK

2579
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
this is a very deep question

2580
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
certainly

2581
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I personally don't know

2582
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
would be willing to use dependency theory entirely

2583
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
his angle

2584
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Analyze the phenomena you just mentioned

2585
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
But of course he is also a

2586
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
very important reference

2587
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
and at some point

2588
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
He explained this by saying

2589
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
them

2590
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Their traditional so-called north-south relationship

2591
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
North represents this advanced republic

2592
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
nation

2593
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
so-called core state

2594
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Developing countries

2595
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
or between border countries

2596
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
an unfair or unequal exchange relationship

2597
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
such a theory

2598
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
when that phenomenon exists of course

2599
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
But I also think that phenomenon

2600
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
look in the future

2601
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
he may

2602
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
will be affected by various

2603
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
There are many sources of this shock

2604
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I give a very simple one

2605
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
source

2606
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,360
as an example

2607
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:05,600
I'm not going to talk about that banknote or about Apple just yet.

2608
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,860
because when that is more complicated

2609
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:09,720
Because that is the value chain you just mentioned

2610
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,120
right

2611
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:13,720
The multinational company monopolizes one of the largest parts

2612
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,720
good

2613
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:18,260
But even if we don't talk about this value chain first

2614
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:19,800
its this

2615
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:21,520
its pentagonal problem

2616
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,920
That is to say, we talk about the traditional exchange between the north and the south

2617
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,160
basically the same thing

2618
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:33,020
Industrial countries cash countries sell high this value

2619
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,720
The so-called technology-intensive with high unit price

2620
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,260
This capital intensive product

2621
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:37,620
right

2622
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:40,020
to the developer country

2623
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:41,160
The developer exports

2624
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:44,820
For example, this low-end labor-intensive product

2625
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:50,360
Or just directly export the raw materials needed by this agricultural industry

2626
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:50,960
right

2627
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,160
coffee beans

2628
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:52,760
right

2629
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,360
this banana

2630
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:55,080
soybeans

2631
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,120
Or this iron mine, etc.

2632
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,120
Actually we just

2633
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,940
keep looking at this piece

2634
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:04,240
we'll find out that

2635
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,940
The past 20 years and the next 20 years

2636
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:09,940
profound changes have taken place

2637
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:11,540
why is that

2638
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:13,340
think about it

2639
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:15,740
When I don't know what the average age is when I'm doing

2640
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:16,780
that is

2641
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:19,680
20 years ago

2642
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:23,140
i want to buy a dvd player

2643
01:45:23,140 --> 01:45:25,540
Let me say that it will cost two hundred dollars

2644
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:27,180
right

2645
01:45:27,180 --> 01:45:29,940
now you go to the night market

2646
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:30,780
100 now

2647
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:33,280
You can buy it for 1000 yuan

2648
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,480
OK

2649
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:37,580
you can buy

2650
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:38,380
it means

2651
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:39,580
any item

2652
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:40,480
should say so

2653
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:45,940
when its such manufactured knowledge

2654
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:49,080
Made of such a made

2655
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,680
it is no longer a

2656
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:53,180
a few quick exclusives

2657
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:55,280
but any of many third world businesses

2658
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,380
when it's all ready to produce

2659
01:45:57,380 --> 01:45:58,780
it will start to go into a

2660
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:00,320
The process we call commercialization

2661
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Let's say it becomes a general commodity

2662
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
then its profit will be what

2663
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Very and will be relatively close to economical

2664
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
So talking about a perfectly competitive market

2665
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
ok

2666
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
then we should say

2667
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
In the market, this is also a lot of oil-absorbing companies

2668
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,000
very distressed

2669
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Whether it is China or India

2670
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
That's a deal breaker for this price

2671
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
right

2672
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
just say one day

2673
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
He is now competing with the world for orders

2674
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Say you don't want to put people in danger

2675
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
hit the track

2676
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,000
You think that what Europe does is triple my money

2677
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I'll take over, right?

2678
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
At first when you were half-hearted, right?

2679
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
but some people try

2680
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
The result looks good, doesn't it?

2681
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
The family will continue

2682
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
or say we say

2683
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
The most recent governor of California this Brown

2684
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Visiting Mainland China in April

2685
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
he wants to do something

2686
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:57,000
He said he hoped that mainland China would invest in California's high-speed rail

2687
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
ok

2688
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Although Wenzhou also appeared

2689
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:00,800
a motor vehicle incident

2690
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:01,700
but truth be told

2691
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:03,700
Now the entire high-speed rail is constantly expanding

2692
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:07,500
And its technology is now very, very mature

2693
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,300
It had its latecomer advantage at that time

2694
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,400
The reason is very complicated

2695
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,900
I didn't have time to unfold

2696
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:14,400
But what was said yesterday

2697
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:18,400
Its high-speed rail has been a technology for generations

2698
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,100
Its first generation is of course from France, Germany, Japan

2699
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,600
right? learn

2700
01:47:22,600 --> 01:47:24,400
right? learn

2701
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,900
Is the second-generation technology improved?

2702
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:29,000
But it has to be based on some of China's own

2703
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,100
some special climate geography

2704
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:35,600
Various conditions it continues to improve

2705
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,300
And it now has the fourth generation of this climate

2706
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,800
Why can it enter several generations of this technology in such a short period of time

2707
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:44,300
It's simple, it has a big market

2708
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:46,100
Right, after Japan builds the Shinkansen

2709
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:48,300
It is basically difficult to expand

2710
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,900
So I can't have the capital to invest

2711
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:53,800
Said the technology of the second generation, the third generation, and the fourth generation

2712
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,400
Because you can't recycle

2713
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:57,400
Right, the Middle East itself can recycle

2714
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,900
It can be recycled at home

2715
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,400
After Taiwan gained the advantage

2716
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,480
it's in the field

2717
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,960
what it does all over the world

2718
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:08,000
Will destroy the market price and value

2719
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,680
This process happens naturally

2720
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,920
the other way around

2721
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:16,160
Let's talk about Chile

2722
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:19,200
It sold out for a cheap meal

2723
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:19,440
right

2724
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:22,920
How much has the unit price of Tongkuang increased in the past 20 years?

2725
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:23,600
think about it

2726
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:24,400
iron ore

2727
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,760
Of course, Tongkuang Iron Mine is not only located in backward countries

2728
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,920
Canada and Australia also benefited a lot

2729
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:33,120
Because it is also a resource-rich country

2730
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:34,040
That is to say

2731
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,800
Traditional North-South Trade Price Ratio

2732
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,040
has undergone profound changes

2733
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,920
That is to say, you grow coffee beans

2734
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,400
grow bananas

2735
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,280
how much car you can get

2736
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,560
How many armored vehicles

2737
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,400
how much motorcycle

2738
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,360
how much dvd

2739
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:48,400
how much refrigerator

2740
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:51,120
That ratio is already changing

2741
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,840
Just be a price breaker

2742
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,800
In turn it can be lower cost

2743
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:59,000
Let more people around the world buy

2744
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
normal person

2745
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,140
Industrial products deemed essential

2746
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:04,640
So it's an important change

2747
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,140
Then come back and talk about it

2748
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:07,480
you just said that

2749
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:08,780
That's the one

2750
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:11,140
The value chain is very complicated

2751
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:12,140
because it means

2752
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:13,140
as far as we're going to understand

2753
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:14,640
to make sure how he goes

2754
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:18,180
How did you get into so many countries?

2755
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:19,740
hospital system

2756
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:21,540
into his kind

2757
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,740
a whole of thinking

2758
01:49:23,740 --> 01:49:26,940
Breastfeeding is not safe or milk powder is better

2759
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:29,000
And when he got to the hospital, he

2760
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,140
He will send it as soon as he is born, right?

2761
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:32,640
deliver

2762
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,640
He has a very delicate set of mechanisms

2763
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:39,740
To make many people willing to use milk powder

2764
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:41,140
instead of breast milk

2765
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:43,140
He shaped the whole idea

2766
01:49:43,140 --> 01:49:44,500
It is he who shapes his needs

2767
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,440
should say so

2768
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,240
And the shaping of this demand

2769
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,740
is very ingrained

2770
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:49,240
a hand to what

2771
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:50,440
reach out

2772
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:50,800
right

2773
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:53,440
Hospital obstetrics and obstetrics

2774
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,240
over there in the nursery

2775
01:49:56,240 --> 01:49:57,240
Of course this is designed

2776
01:49:57,240 --> 01:49:58,640
each country many

2777
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,040
Now some countries have opened up land law

2778
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Said that you can't accept it casually in your hospital

2779
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
And even the foreign strong enemy law says that you in principle

2780
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Doctors have to teach mothers how to breastfeed their babies

2781
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
at least give him that possibility

2782
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Or else we just develop the idea

2783
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
it has to be like this

2784
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Besides, I said that the online world will actually

2785
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
For all existing we see borrowed business models

2786
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
great destructive power

2787
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
We've been in a lot of small shops now

2788
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
everyone can see

2789
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Say this is Bangladesh

2790
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:37,000
A cooperative formed by the tea workers themselves

2791
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Products sold directly here

2792
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
mark it out

2793
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
and it has a certified

2794
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
OK

2795
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
It has an NGO International Research

2796
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
it certifies that it does

2797
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
This is a group of workers themselves

2798
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
A cooperative production and sale of something

2799
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Then its profit can be bigger

2800
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
feed back to this producer

2801
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
As long as we change our minds

2802
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Why do I buy tea?

2803
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:05,440
What to buy? Which is the most famous car in the UK?

2804
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,200
Said it belonged to the Queen of England

2805
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,080
why are you spending that money

2806
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,380
Actually he is from India

2807
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:12,740
isn't it

2808
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,380
right

2809
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:16,880
He just went through many layers

2810
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,180
Is this resale packaging right?

2811
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:20,980
Then come MLM

2812
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:22,580
and then advertise, right?

2813
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:25,380
Then sell you so expensive, right?

2814
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:26,880
So now any world

2815
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,500
any corner

2816
01:51:28,580 --> 01:51:31,800
You just talked about those who are directly involved in the production

2817
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,240
online world

2818
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:36,780
find its way

2819
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:39,900
that may now be fully opened

2820
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:44,580
So I'd say it's also an unprecedented destruction mechanism

2821
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:45,800
But many actually say

2822
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,600
That is to say, if there are many imbalances in the status quo,

2823
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,500
lots of twisted stuff

2824
01:51:51,500 --> 01:51:56,800
Now that is to say that the world may have very specific changes

2825
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:57,400
very specific changes

2826
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:59,900
I think the process is already underway

2827
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,500
good

2828
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:03,320
ask the professor

2829
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:05,880
The professor just mentioned

2830
01:52:06,140 --> 01:52:07,160
explain

2831
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:09,980
the future one

2832
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:15,100
The currency of our first Asian region will be denominated in RMB

2833
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,920
A major trade settlement currency

2834
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:22,780
Then ask the professor, will there be RMB like this?

2835
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:24,580
have that reproductive

2836
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,380
long space

2837
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,020
ah

2838
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:37,680
Is it because US dollars are used in the United States now?

2839
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:38,440
I understand

2840
01:52:38,700 --> 01:52:40,500
So the dollar one

2841
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,800
this problem

2842
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:50,220
I dare not answer why easily, because if you want to use this as the next stage, do you need to go to the bank to open the RMB

2843
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,760
if i am

2844
01:52:52,020 --> 01:52:55,080
dare not take that risk lightly

2845
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:56,620
that is

2846
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,440
should say so

2847
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,120
However, the gradual appreciation of the RMB in the future

2848
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:06,400
relative to US dollar

2849
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:08,960
It should last for a while

2850
01:53:09,980 --> 01:53:14,080
Especially now that he is carrying out such a big strategy of RMB internationalization

2851
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:16,640
So he will especially hedge in RMB

2852
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:18,440
one of his stable

2853
01:53:18,940 --> 01:53:21,240
Even give people a little appreciation expectation

2854
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,800
That will strengthen that will.

2855
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,360
Many people are willing to open RMB accounts.

2856
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:27,640
many trading companies

2857
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,440
Enterprises are willing to settle in RMB

2858
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:30,720
I think he's still at this stage

2859
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:34,040
And he is the one who has the ability to guide the yuan

2860
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:35,320
Current price

2861
01:53:35,580 --> 01:53:35,580

2862
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:37,620
This process will take some time

2863
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:38,400
But what?

2864
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,440
I can also tell you that the range will not be very large.

2865
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:41,980
he will let him go very slowly

2866
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,820
Maybe it's like this, okay?

2867
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,240
professor my problem has disadvantages this lady's problem

2868
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,080
I used to work in a trading company when I was young

2869
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,960
We all know that the United States is using the war

2870
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,080
When the European system collapsed

2871
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:06,620
He forcibly changed the gold system to US dollars

2872
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:08,580
So these decades

2873
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:12,580
America's financial severance

2874
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:17,580
There is more colonization than the whole west

2875
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:19,580
Like I used to work in comics

2876
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:22,580
He uses economic negotiations every year

2877
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:24,080
Triennial Act

2878
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,580
force you to reproduce

2879
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:31,160
The money we worked hard for

2880
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,160
he is gone

2881
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:33,160
eat it

2882
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:34,160
eat it

2883
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:37,160
So now the second currency

2884
01:54:37,160 --> 01:54:39,160
do we have manpower

2885
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:41,160
Or can the United States tolerate it?

2886
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,160
this problem

2887
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:53,160
It should be a lot of history and some long-term changes

2888
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:56,740
Not entirely human subjective will

2889
01:54:56,740 --> 01:54:58,740
fully determinable

2890
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
many not any country

2891
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,500
Or any government he can completely dominate and control

2892
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:10,500
because if we say if we say America

2893
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:14,300
If it is entirely in his own national interest

2894
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:17,000
Logically speaking, he should have

2895
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:23,000
It should be said that it is a comprehensive economic blockade of mainland China.

2896
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,700
would never let him grow up today

2897
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:27,000
Already such a big fast head

2898
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,800
That is to say, he has grown into such a big fast head today

2899
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,000
It's not what he wants to see

2900
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,500
That is to say

2901
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:35,500
Or he doesn't need a Latin American county

2902
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,400
become so independent

2903
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:38,800
Yes, it was my backyard

2904
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,600
And now Latin America is very, very independent now

2905
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:47,000
Many of his own new summits in Latin America

2906
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,800
or some new cooperation machines

2907
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,600
America is not invited

2908
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:54,600
Therefore, some diplomatic operations in the United States almost shed tears

2909
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,900
The Monroe Doctrine is long dead

2910
01:55:56,900 --> 01:56:00,000
Originally this was my place

2911
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
so i just say

2912
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
just say i agree say just say

2913
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Of course he is not necessarily happy to see these

2914
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:11,000
For his original enjoyment of such a

2915
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
So this challenge of supremacy

2916
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
or shock

2917
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,000
But sometimes there is nothing to do, right?

2918
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
because there is nothing to do

2919
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,000
So Obama still has to be at the California estate

2920
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
right

2921
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
With Xi Jinping, whether you like him or not

2922
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Do you think highly of his system or not?

2923
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
but he had to date

2924
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
just basically

2925
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,000
So you say he has the ability to go

2926
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Solo dollar supremacy challenged

2927
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
In fact, a large part depends on the United States itself.

2928
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,000
that is to say yourself

2929
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
The first to say whether you can continue to maintain your

2930
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
A dynamic of the economy in certain areas

2931
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
including innovation

2932
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
technological innovation etc.

2933
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,000
In addition, you can put your own this

2934
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Fiscal Financial system becomes more sound

2935
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Able to let others treat you for a long time in this financial market

2936
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
I have great confidence and great interest in your capital market

2937
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:18,000
In this case, people are very willing to hold US dollars, right?

2938
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,000
If not, of course the United States is still a

2939
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
It should be said that the capital is still full

2940
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Although it has hints

2941
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
But I don't know it's coming down soon, no

2942
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Because you think about the size of the United States, right?

2943
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
that big this can root

2944
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
And there's a lot of stuff underground

2945
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Many people were reluctant to look forward to it before, right?

2946
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So let it attract a lot of high-tech talents from all over the world

2947
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
go to college and keep it, right?

2948
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,000
So it still has this kind of

2949
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I said that in some fields

2950
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
The strength to maintain a considerable leading position is still there

2951
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
just say but i just say

2952
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
What I am most worried about about the United States is its overall system.

2953
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Is this system able to

2954
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,580
In the next 20 to 25 years, an effective

2955
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:08,840
such a decision in response to its grand challenge

2956
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:10,680
with this action plan in real time

2957
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:12,680
I just talked about its aging population

2958
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:15,180
complicating race relations

2959
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:17,180
and then its finances

2960
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:19,880
In fact, these difficulties have not yet been seen.

2961
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:22,380
it has a very clear set

2962
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:27,980
This draft and the self-labeled set of scheme diagrams

2963
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:29,980
good

2964
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:31,980
you

2965
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:33,980
did you hear the professor

2966
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:35,980

2967
01:58:35,980 --> 01:58:36,980
green

2968
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:39,980
Looking at the current slideshow

2969
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:40,980
yes

2970
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:43,980
If from 2011 to 30 years

2971
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:45,980
it is such a situation

2972
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:46,980
yes

2973
01:58:46,980 --> 01:58:50,980
Well basically it's based on a noun

2974
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:53,980
a condition called state capitalism

2975
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:55,980
developed in the afternoon

2976
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:57,980
my question is

2977
01:58:57,980 --> 01:58:59,980
Is it possible that in 30 years

2978
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
20 years ago it would have a political change

2979
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
major changes

2980
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
this political change

2981
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
what impact will it have

2982
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Thanks

2983
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
good

2984
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
If the answer to this question

2985
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
I think Dean Peng will invite me again next year

2986
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
give a speech

2987
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
I'm probably going to dedicate an hour to the talk

2988
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
to answer

2989
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
an initial answer

2990
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
In fact, my entire video

2991
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
The first half is answering this matter

2992
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
But because today's topic is

2993
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
The Rise of the Non-Western World and the Restructuring of One of the World Economies

2994
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
So I didn't talk about the first half

2995
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I think actually

2996
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:49,000
When it comes to it, this future has to face challenges

2997
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
or russia is up to the challenge

2998
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
India faces challenges

2999
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
In fact, there are many

3000
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
We must also clearly see

3001
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
including mainland China

3002
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
especially its ecology

3003
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
water land air

3004
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:10,000
There are also some social contradictions

3005
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
but i personally mean

3006
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
don't underestimate it either

3007
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:20,000
is to solve it in the development process

3008
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
The kind of ability that emerges from the problem

3009
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
don't underestimate its ability

3010
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
because we used to

3011
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,000
The United States and many Westerners have long underestimated

3012
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,000
To underestimate it is to predict wrong every time

3013
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
That is to say, we have often heard

3014
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
China's financial system collapsed soon

3015
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Also very famous this NIC LARD

3016
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
The famous Chinese economist in the United States

3017
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:48,000
It is also said that China will not be guaranteed at any time

3018
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Even pig Rongji is nervous

3019
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Really, our food security is very problematic

3020
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,000
So hurry up and do a lot of things

3021
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
ensure food security

3022
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,000
In the past few years, the food production has been a bit surplus

3023
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I think his system operation management

3024
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
should say so

3025
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Humans don't have much experience

3026
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:16,000
manage a large scale

3027
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,000
So complex is the experience of such a society

3028
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
He himself is groping

3029
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
should say so

3030
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Well but let's just say

3031
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
We've seen him from the past

3032
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
at every stage

3033
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
He faces various challenges at each stage

3034
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
his ability to respond

3035
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Then as well as understand his inner set

3036
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
that management machine

3037
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
how does he put

3038
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
that is to say the right person

3039
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Have enough knowledge and ability

3040
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
and put him in place

3041
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
he has his very complex mechanism

3042
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
We must not ignore this mechanism

3043
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
This mechanism may be similar to what we understand

3044
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
written

3045
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
are different

3046
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:04,000
But it has formed a system

3047
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,500
The other one is that this machine comes from a model

3048
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:08,000
not so strange

3049
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,500
why

3050
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:10,000
Because it came with two thousand people from China

3051
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:11,500
day set that governs

3052
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:14,000
Philosophy is related to that wisdom

3053
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,500
is in the same line

3054
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Because it is in such a

3055
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:21,000
very high population density

3056
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,500
Ecologically very fragile

3057
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,500
environment

3058
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Then there is such a big difference between the coast and the inland

3059
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
under such an early

3060
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,500
govern effectively

3061
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
accumulated things

3062
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,500
For example we say

3063
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,500
In Chinese history, there are many

3064
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,000
very clear rules

3065
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,500
For example, you must

3066
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,000
you are from Jiangsu

3067
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,500
You can't be an official in Jiangsu

3068
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:48,500
right

3069
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:50,000
Zhou Daxian also has this

3070
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,000
or at least first and second

3071
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,500
Absolutely no two people are locals

3072
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,000
must come from abroad

3073
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
past

3074
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
In other words, the Chinese dynasties

3075
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
It should mean that we must finish the Jingguan and go to the local compound

3076
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,000
want him in the recovery area

3077
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Poor areas have experience as officials

3078
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,000
for making him a different kind of career

3079
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I can't say that my Shanghai will always be a career in Shanghai

3080
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
OK you are going to Gansu

3081
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
you are going to this beijing

3082
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
After that you see things differently

3083
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
You are not egotistical anymore

3084
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
The whole set of training mechanism for his current cadres

3085
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
totally implementing this thing

3086
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
So these things are from a model point of view

3087
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:34,000
We often forget that we actually have a lot of some

3088
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Genes can understand this

3089
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
but it we forget

3090
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
because we're so used to saying

3091
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
As long as it is different from what we think is the most advanced America

3092
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
it's not normal

3093
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
In fact, this concept needs to be broken

3094
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
This idea needs to be broken

3095
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,000
ok because of time

3096
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I think you guys are too slow in raising your hands

3097
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
just didn't raise your hand

3098
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
I've kept it at 9 o'clock

3099
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Then if you have a personal problem

3100
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I know you

3101
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Then you can ask in private

3102
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,240
OK, our speech will end here

3103
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,760
Remind everyone that there are wonderful events in July

3104
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:11,340
Using Nano-Optics to Help Us Hear the Sounds of Bacteria

3105
02:04:11,340 --> 02:04:12,780
I hope everyone will come

3106
02:04:12,780 --> 02:04:13,780
thank you all

3107
02:04:13,780 --> 02:04:15,780
Thanks again Dr. Zhu
