00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,600

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,060
It is

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,460
not

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
Our feast of knowledge has held many circles

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,720
This effect is also very good

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,020
loved by everyone

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,020
what about today

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, that today we have a special invitation to this

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Director of the Institute of Taiwan History

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
come give us a talk on this

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The title of this speech is called

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Japanese Memory in Later Well-known Taiwanese Folk Beliefs

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I just saw this listener

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There is this well-known after we are famous in Taiwan

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Professor Dexing Shang

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Professor Dexing

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,420
I want to ask why he came. Looking at the topic, it turns out that he will definitely come to listen to this speech.

24
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:16,420
Before this speech begins, I, Zhao Li, would like to introduce the brief introduction of today's speaker

25
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:23,420
Professor Xie Guoxing, actually an old friend of mine

26
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:32,380
He is just like what Chen I said just now, he is the researcher and director of the Institute of Taiwan History of our academy

27
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,780
He's also actually a peace fellow at the Institute of Modern History.

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:45,780
His research areas are modern Chinese history, Taiwan's social and economic history, and Taiwan's folk beliefs.

29
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:57,400
He received a Ph.D. from the National 40,000 University at a very early age, and established the Institute of Modern Research as an assistant researcher, associate researcher, researcher, etc.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,900
His academic works are very rich

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The 80th Anniversary of the Academia Sinica in Pursuit of Excellence

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There are also eight special books such as Fucheng Shengshi, News Cake and his pages.

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And editor-in-chief of Taiwan's digital point long results for sustainable management

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Many books on history have also published a lot of academic papers

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In fact, he is an expert in corporate history in Taiwan.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He once studied the rise of the well-known Tainan state

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He also studied the biography of Mr. Chen Hongyan

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mr. Chen Hongyan knows the older generation

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He is the founder of the Taipei Air Camp

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He was also a well-known literati during the Japanese occupation

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, apart from his outstanding academic achievements, the senior

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Administrative qualifications are also quite rich

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Chen Dannen, special assistant to the dean of the hospital and legislators

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
general affairs officer of the head office

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,840
Deputy Director of the Institute of Modern History and all cultural centers of the Institute

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,200
convener, etc.

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,200
Then this shows his academic qualifications and his administrative experience

48
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
is a very rich person

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,640
Then I think this is not clean

50
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,520
The most important thing is to appreciate this report he gave us today

51
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,440
Thank you, director

52
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Vice President Peng

53
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,720
Colleagues in this hospital and friends outside the hospital

54
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Thank you very much for coming today

55
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
We also thought that there are so many people

56
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,480
At first it was

57
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,560
Vice President Huang

58
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,480
ask if i can come

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,720
He should have said he assigned me to give a lecture

60
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,560
then i readily agree

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,760
I think this popular science thing

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,240
us

63
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,240
if there happens to be something readily available

64
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,040
Can come

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
come to report to you

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
that should be a meaningful thing

67
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,240
That just happened to remind me of some of the things I've done recently

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,880
Issues related to Taiwanese folk beliefs

69
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,320
There is one that not everyone knows

70
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,800
but may be of interest

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,520
so i wholeheartedly agree

72
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,200
That didn't occur to me that I remembered talking to me months ago

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,360
Because I was too busy, I suddenly thought of it

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,600
So I am still changing my ppd this afternoon

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,960
Hope to bring you today

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,800
Learn more about Taiwanese society

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,400
this postcolonial

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,240
It's an academic term

79
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm not going to discuss today

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,240
Theories about postcolonialism

81
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,960
This is not a very interesting topic

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,720
Academia would be more interested

83
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,640
Ordinary people don't necessarily need to know

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why do you combine post-colonial Japan with folk beliefs?

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It is because everyone knows that the general impression of Taiwanese society is that they have a good impression of Japan.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If compared to South Korea that was once colonized

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Or compared to China, which once had a war with Japan

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Taiwan looks different

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Many people will think that the reason why Taiwan’s folk beliefs also have many Japanese elements

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is it because of the influence of Japanese colonial rule until today?

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
there are other wines

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Or use this to let us know a little more about the history of Taiwan

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
social reality

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
First I thought I should explain folk beliefs

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's an academic term

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In my definition this is an academic term

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,680
I am not sure if this term was used in China in the 1930s because it was influenced by Japan

98
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,180
Or take it from the Japanese academic circles and use it

99
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,240
Because many modern Chinese nouns come from Japanese

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,640
For example, everyone knows that economics and philosophy

101
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,020
This is all Japanese translation from English to Kanji

102
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,020
Then China took it directly and used it

103
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,220
So I have a little doubt, but I haven't done detailed research

104
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:42,100
Simply put, folk beliefs are generally used in this way in mainland China and Taiwan.

105
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,900
In some places it is called folk religion

106
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,260
The main meaning of folk belief in Taiwan refers to the belief in ghosts and gods

107
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,300
However, there are some miscellaneous parts in it that first worship and follow the world.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,440
Tomorrow's belief itself does not have too many institutional religious rituals and scriptures

109
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
or not at all

110
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,320
Systematic rituals and classics

111
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,040
where an institutional religion is necessary

112
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
but tomorrow faith does not

113
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,560
when he needs the ritual

114
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,960
When classics are needed, he intervenes in a teaching

115
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,320
So if you go to temples in various places in Taiwan to see

116
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,560
Often seen in the temple of what we call Tomorrow's Faith

117
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,640
There will be a member of the Taoist Association of the Republic of China hanging on his door

118
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,520
He said he was a Taoist

119
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,800
In fact, Taoism was one of the institutional religions in the past.

120
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,960
Taoism has its own rituals and scriptures

121
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,600
Tomorrow belief in Taiwan is mainly involved in Taoist classics

122
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
When various religious ceremonies are required

123
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,240
In fact, Taoism in Taiwan does not have its own public relations

124
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
That is to say, the public temple

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,160
Because Taoism in Taiwan is mainly righteous

126
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
He always set up groups at home

127
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,660
Then go out to do errands, go out to pick up cases

128
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,200
It can be said that more than 90% of Taiwan's Taoism survives on folk beliefs

129
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,500
If everyone doesn't do it, don't do it another time

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,000
That Taoist temple will all be closed

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,660
So this is a cross talk relationship

132
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,500
but they

133
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,300
You still can't say folk belief is Taoism

134
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,000
In terms of what we're really working on defining

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
There's still a big difference between the two

136
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I think folk beliefs are in the daily life of ordinary people in Taiwan society

137
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
If we want to talk about various religions

138
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
we can't say it's called a believer

139
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
because it's not very strict

140
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
can be defined as a believer

141
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
But it is the religion that participates in the most religious activities

142
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
It is folk belief with the largest population

143
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Taiwan's folk beliefs are of course mainly derived from the bright moon

144
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
This Japanese memory we are going to talk about today

145
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
There are two main levels

146
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
one is

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Taiwanese folk opera

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
Worship many Japanese gods

149
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Where did this Japanese god come from?

150
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,280
why do you want to worship

151
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
This is what I want to introduce to you today

152
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
give some examples

153
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,080
most

154
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
so far we

155
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,960
Examples I can understand

156
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,480
another one is

157
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,440
Japanese style head

158
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,120
About the team performing at the temple fair

159
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
it's japan

160
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,080
categorized

161
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,520
Japanese form

162
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,960
There has been a trend in recent years

163
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
But in fact in truly representative

164
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
from a long time ago

165
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,080
why is there such

166
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,360
and

167
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
From five days to now

168
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,920
even

169
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Not only did not decline

170
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,440
and more and more

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,040
what is that

172
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,440
what could be the reason

173
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
It's what I want to introduce to you today

174
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,480
This post-famous

175
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
will be clean

176
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,000
The topic to be talked about

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
Because generally we can easily think of saying

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,960
you hear very serious japanese memories

179
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,380
Is it a result of colonial rule?

180
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,220
Or does he have other factors that can explain it?

181
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,040
Although all our Japanese memories

182
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,480
In the area of ​​Japanese gods

183
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,720
It seems to be related to Japan

184
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,960
But in fact, the Japanese gods worshiped in Taiwanese temples

185
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,620
Japanese gods worshiped at Japanese shrines

186
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,520
How to pray, the form, the ritual and the meaning are completely different

187
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,680
In fact, it was invented by Taiwan itself.

188
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,240
How to worship this Japanese

189
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,220
Or will it eventually be integrated into the Chinese-style mid-range series?

190
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,980
So he looks like he has something to do with Japan

191
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,760
But in fact, his essence is still Chinese

192
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,660
or Taiwanese, mostly Taiwanese

193
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,960
not necessarily chinese

194
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,020
Because Japanese gods are not worshiped in China

195
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,800
In mainland China, even in Yuanxiang

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
I started worshiping after I came to Taiwan

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,160
There must be a special reason for him

198
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
So I want to take this opportunity to introduce to you

199
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,140
how did he get here

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Does he have any evolutionary history?

201
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,320
or what's the point

202
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,720
Well, if such an element appears in Taiwan's Tomorrow Antenna

203
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,900
Is it the legacy of having had enough of Japan's responsible rule?

204
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,500
In other words, this kind of culture continues to influence related

205
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,840
This is a topic I want to answer today

206
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,900
Of course what I report is what I see

207
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,180
what i understand

208
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,980
for your reference

209
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,780
This is not a standard answer

210
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,620
Let's start by explaining

211
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,440
I said

212
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,720
memory of japan

213
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,540
That is, Japanese elements are in Chinese teaching, in Taiwan Chinese teaching

214
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,080
In fact, before the war

215
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,620
just before the end of the war

216
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,400
A former shrine in Taiwan

217
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,460
is so irrelevant

218
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,020
When I was a Japanese student, I actually worked very hard.

219
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,560
to push

220
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,580
shrine

221
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,020
Taiwan used to have about 200

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
More than 200 shrines

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,500
Among them are shrines of various ranks managed by the government system

224
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,000
at least sixty-eight

225
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Of course, everyone knows that the biggest one is Yuanshan.

226
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now Yuanshan Hotel used to be called Taiwan Shrine

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Or Shenge or Taiwan Shrine

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That is equivalent to the land farm level

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Then there are national

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
it has many levels

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
these shrines

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
After the war, most of them were changed into Zhongli poems

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Or lovesickness naturally

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
late in the war

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Apart from the ring-illumination movement

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
ask home

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The original God tanks in your home cannot carry Ancestors

238
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Can't bring gods

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Also bring Japanese gods

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
so thunderbolt

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
At that time, the idols were not burned

242
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
just to hide

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And as the war progressed

244
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
for

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The people, the general manager, and the government must invite teachers and students from public schools to visit the shrine collectively, visit the shrine on a regular basis, and examine

246
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This was probably in the 1940s, late in the war, it was obvious

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
After such strong indoctrination, we can count from Huang Minhua in 1935

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:36,000
For at least 10 years until 1945, Japan vigorously promoted or instilled rituals such as Japanese Shinto shrines in Taiwanese society.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
After 10 years of practice or nurturing, once the war is over, there will be nothing for a lifetime

250
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000
All the Japanese shrine elements in the home are now gone after the relationship

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
First, I ran to a certain black house, and the god that people worshiped came out again immediately

252
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Gao Se is completely withdrawn from Taiwan

253
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm not exaggerating when I say something wrong

254
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But Taiwan is now visible

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is the only relatively complete look in Taiwan.

256
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Possibly outside Japan

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Keep the best look in the world

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This look was built in 1938

259
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's called Taoyuan Look

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hsinchu Central Taoyuan

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Covered look of a present set

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is the official look

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This is Torii

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Torii usually have two floors

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think you have been to Japan

266
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I have seen the news of the look

267
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There were originally five torii gates

268
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
ginseng rice in japan

269
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
going to look

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
usually noisy with the road every day

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There will be several torii gates

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
At the same time, there were originally five

273
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There are four because the road is too wide

274
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
etc.

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At the same time dance only this one

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And it is cut into double ten

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Originally two layers

278
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Become a double ten shape

279
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Everyone, if you have been to Tainan's original Juwang Pond

280
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There is also a similar double pool

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It turned out to be a torii

282
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It was also renovated to become a double pool now

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Then Bai Chongxi put the words on it

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This is the worship of the shrine

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
reservation would be good

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In 1972

287
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Because Taiwan broke off diplomatic relations with Japan

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
was supposed to clear all

289
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Express Japanese nationalism

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Music Sensation Colonial Remnants

291
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't know why this Taiwanese shrine

292
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
did not dismantle

293
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Maybe it's because Taiwan

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
the sea is well preserved

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Because most of the shrines were built after the war

296
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
was changed to

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Almost all of them are changed to middle words

298
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Japanese period shrine

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Originally, there were quite a few words in the middle list

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It is to pay homage to these Japanese foreign wars

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
or died in the line of duty

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Mainly military and police personnel

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
There is a Chinese word next to this Wonsan Hotel

304
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,080
That place turned out to be what they called Zhengguo Shrine

305
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,920
It is dedicated to paying homage to Japanese soldiers who died in battle

306
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Of course it also includes the assumption that there are Taiwanese there

307
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,400
Later that was changed to the middle word

308
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,760
Ability to refurb heavy cover

309
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,120
Who was the Taoyuan Shrine that was not deleted?

310
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,360
It should also be because he changed it to a middle word

311
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,560
And his buildings are preserved in this way to make people complete

312
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,120
Originally in 1980

313
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,880
The Taiwan county government feels that this shrine is a bit dilapidated

314
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,680
Decided to dismantle it and replace it with a new one

315
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,600
Already dispatched

316
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,040
that race is over

317
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,400
The architect who won the bid is going to see the site

318
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
How can such a good architect be demolished?

319
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So after 1985

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
At that time, Taiwanese society was more accepting.

321
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Use the concept of cultural assets to look at such buildings

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
So not only is there no difference

323
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And asked the government to grant money to renovate

324
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So in 1994 he became a tertiary stock fund

325
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, Taiwan in recent years

326
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
past two years

327
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Suddenly added two new shrines

328
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This shrine is very small, in fact, it looks like a shrine

329
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But he's interesting

330
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
he is this place

331
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The Wudanshe Incident in Pingtung in 1874

332
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's just an excuse from Japan

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Lu Xiong has been killed by this surrogate in Taiwan

334
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So send troops to visit and punish Taiwan

335
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's why it's called the Wudanshe Incident, in 1874

336
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The place where it happened is the Buddhist Temple in Gaoshi

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
The shrine acquired by Takashi Buddhist Shrine the year before last

338
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,900
a Japanese priest

339
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,900
In order to thank him, he spent 10 million yen himself

340
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,500
In order to thank the Taiwanese people who suffered from the March 1 earthquake for their respect for Japan

341
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,500
so he made this shrine

342
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,900
Send to Gao Shi Buddhist Society

343
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,300
The current Gaoshi Buddhist Society

344
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,300
all aborigines

345
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,900
almost all christian

346
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
But they think this shrine is meaningful

347
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,000
He said it was from the Peony Society to the present

348
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,000
The aborigines here in the Peony Society have feuded with Japan

349
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
Hope this solves it

350
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,800
it means friendly

351
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,400
I think this kind of explanation is also very meaningful

352
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,900
Well, the other shrine was just 60% the year before.

353
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,400
This is a completely new shrine built on the old foundation

354
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,360
This is a torii. Standard torii.

355
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,600
this is a small shrine

356
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,380
This shrine government is small

357
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,320
Its face width is very small

358
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,680
Japanese shrine

359
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,520
If you have been to Japan, you will know

360
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,820
Except for that big store

361
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,200
There will often be many small ones next to them

362
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,720
similar to what we say

363
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,060
That is also a shrine

364
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,520
This kind of shrine is basically like this

365
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
This was originally a Japanese immigrant village.

366
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,040
It was originally called Routing Immigrant Village

367
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,440
That

368
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
why is this

369
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,200
This is led by the county government

370
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,480
There is absolutely no religious reason for sightseeing

371
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,200
think we commanded the shrine

372
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,120
will attract more tourists

373
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,480
Do you guys see why there is an incense burner next to it?

374
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
there is a gold furnace

375
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,380
Because there is a temple next to it

376
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
This is the village temple

377
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,280
well, the story should start here

378
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,340
this place

379
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,600
It turned out to be an old shrine

380
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,120
its foundations are still

381
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,560
it's all falling

382
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,060
just started after the war

383
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,600
This is for everyone video immigrant village

384
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,440
Japanese usually go back

385
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,320
The original Taiwanese outside the immigrant village

386
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,040
basically Han Chinese

387
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,040
just come in

388
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,880
And then there were successive

389
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,800
Residents from felt immigrant homes and other places sign in

390
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
So the population of this village is increasing

391
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,200
A place with only population needs goodbye

392
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,600
need goodbye

393
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
First of all usually if there is no god

394
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
worship the land

395
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,560
it's normal

396
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,760
So in the beginning we put that

397
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,880
At that time the shrine was broken

398
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,840
right on top of this foundation

399
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,440
Take a simple one to worship the Lord of the Earth

400
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,720
Later the population increased

401
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
more and more gods

402
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,400
Because people everywhere depend on

403
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,760
Bring their gods too

404
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
after goodbye

405
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,760
let them worship together

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,900
Now they later built a temple called Kunchi Hall

407
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,200
I just saw a temple with a golden furnace

408
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,240
because there are too many people

409
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,680
It turns out that the Earth Temple is too small

410
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,240
Therefore, the Kunchi Hall was built on the open space next to the Digong Temple of the God Society.

411
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,140
After the completion of construction, the Temple of Earth God was abandoned.

412
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,700
I don't need it, so it's empty there

413
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,100
so now we have the chance to bring it back

414
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,200
Put another one on the front

415
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,000
Shrine built for sightseeing tour

416
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
This is a shrine

417
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,500
This foundation is the volume of the steps of the shrine in the old immigrant village era in the Japanese era

418
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,100
That above now see these are new

419
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,200
These lights should be new too.

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,700
That's about as far as I know

421
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,600
Taiwan has relatively complete shrines, old and new

422
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You may also see

423
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,560
There are remains of shrines, but they are all incomplete

424
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,380
If you have the opportunity to go to Taiwan

425
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,940
this

426
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,960
zero department store

427
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,040
On the top of the roof of Zero Department Store

428
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,060
There must be you as a shrine

429
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,600
that was back then

430
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,640
The department store built its own shrine

431
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,660
do it there

432
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,500
He still kept parts that weren't completely broken

433
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,300
good

434
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,100
I will introduce next

435
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,620
Japanese gods

436
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,920
There are quite a few Japanese gods in Taiwan

437
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,240
What I will introduce to you later is to compare

438
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,520
It should be said that the more famous

439
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,080
In fact there are a few more that I didn't include

440
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,900
that but maybe smaller

441
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,720
The earliest and most northern part I know is that Wugu has a nickname

442
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,260
doing a japanese god

443
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,800
because north is south

444
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,580
the further south the more

445
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,940
These Japanese gods have a characteristic

446
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,200
today

447
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,260
was first

448
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,600
probably since the 1920s

449
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,820
ah

450
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,640
Japanese gods appear

451
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,400
It is the Japanese who are worshiped as gods

452
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,920
passed away

453
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,720
until now more and more

454
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,280
They also have common characteristics

455
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,080
they all died

456
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,280
just die badly

457
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,360
suicide

458
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,840
killed in this war

459
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,560
or accidental death

460
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,920
All kinds of deaths are rarely normal

461
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,400
These gods who became the gods of Japan

462
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,680
mostly this way

463
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,760
Especially in the later period, many of them are related to war

464
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,200
Why is there a special emphasis on dying

465
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,840
This is because in Taiwan the traditional

466
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,120
inside ghost priest

467
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,840
dead person

468
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,240
if our own ancestors

469
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,600
because someone worshiped

470
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,200
So it's not a question of whether he becomes a ghost or not

471
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,280
but this

472
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,080
If someone dies unexpectedly and no one worships him

473
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,480
is a ghost

474
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,840
and if he is

475
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
If you die, that will become a regulation

476
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,100
Well, if things like this are going to be messed up and come to celebrate birthdays, that would be very scary.

477
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
So Taiwan is full of hidden palaces and temples

478
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,400
It's out of this fear, fear

479
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,500
As you all know, China has a very famous god

480
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
called sightseeing

481
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,100
Holy Land Army

482
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Why so many people please be so holy

483
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
In the first life, he also died of knowing

484
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,500
You have to actually think about how sightseeing dies.

485
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,500
If sightseeing becomes a ghost one day

486
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,500
And if he's going to fight, don't you think that's scary?

487
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,200
his power

488
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,900
So I hurry up and make him a god

489
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:56,300
The first Japanese to become a Japanese god was a Japanese policeman

490
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,700
He is also dead

491
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
he is also himself

492
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
suicide

493
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
But he is for

494
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Avoid local people fighting for rights

495
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The result was stabbed

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
he feels very

497
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
he felt

498
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
he was wronged

499
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I feel very upset

500
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
so he killed himself

501
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
this

502
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Japanese police call wearing blue natural

503
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
in the locals

504
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Usually it is simply referred to as the Japanese Prince

505
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
why? because

506
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
he attached

507
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Mr. Fu'an worshiped a bunch of gods

508
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
There is also a custom

509
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
every october

510
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
will win the prince

511
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Send off the prince

512
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
will make a kingship

513
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
burn him

514
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Wang Chuanche is very simple and mainly made of paper

515
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
so every year

516
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
there will be one in october

517
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The ceremony of sending off the prince

518
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
That's because there are many gods

519
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
many do not understand

520
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Abbreviation

521
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
after death

522
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
no matter the japanese

523
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
or Chinese

524
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
or Taiwanese

525
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
or become a god

526
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
usually

527
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It is related to this miraculous deed

528
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
absolutely not without reason

529
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
if it doesn't work

530
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
There must be a supernatural

531
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
or weirdness

532
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The most common statement is

533
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
someone died somewhere

534
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And then a few years later

535
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
start ghosting

536
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
say last night

537
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
i saw a person

538
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
riding a white horse

539
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
ready to go

540
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
A few days later another person said

541
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
yes i saw it too

542
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I spread more and more

543
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
everyone starts to fear

544
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
just remembered to say

545
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Because that place was many years ago

546
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
there was a murder

547
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
one person died at the scene

548
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
go with them

549
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
build a small temple

550
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
do him

551
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
just balance

552
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Most of them have Yingong Temple

553
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
that's how it came

554
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
or

555
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
this

556
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,300
Probably only Yiaigong Japanese gods

557
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,200
Although he died in a coma

558
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,900
But he doesn't belong to the Faith of Pregnancy

559
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,500
The Japanese we are talking about here

560
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,200
Almost all Japanese gods are part of the belief in pregnancy

561
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,700
Pregnant

562
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,200
let's look at this first

563
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,500
This Fu'an Gong was only completed in the first two years

564
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,100
He has a ton of gods in his hall

565
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,700
There are about 50 statues

566
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,700
There is only one statue named Yi Ai Gong

567
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,900
because he asked wrong

568
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,500
Which one is Yi Ai Gong?

569
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,600
Therefore, for the convenience of energy out of position, give him a brand name

570
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,200
put a name tag

571
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,900
The other gods have no names

572
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
only love public

573
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,500
because he is very famous

574
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,400
And because it started in 1920

575
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Later, a lot of Fu Lai

576
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,100
This is the seaside is relatively poor

577
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Later many immigrants

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So separate out the accidental ones

579
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So when there were the most in Taiwan, there were real temples worshiping this accidental public.

580
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Some are ancestral gods, some are northern gods

581
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Mostly local residents

582
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Most of them are in Chiayi

583
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The farthest one is in Xinzhuang

584
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There is a temple in Xinzhuang

585
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It's called Beixun Sheng'an Palace

586
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
when they were in 2000

587
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
because this

588
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
accident office

589
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
They are from Yokobe, so they go to Kanagawa Prefecture

590
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Looking for my grandfather's hometown

591
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
go help him

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Received by this of Kanagawa Prefecture

593
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
very grand reception

594
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Just built in 2014

595
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
This one was built in 2014

596
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
in front of the temple on the right

597
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
made a

598
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Embossed story wall

599
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It's just telling the story of the accident

600
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Now the selling point of Fu Angong

601
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
everyone is still asking this

602
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Lang Weizun

603
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
so they just stay here

604
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
made a story wall

605
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
They know this is what everyone is interested in now

606
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,860
So the status of Yi Ai Palace

607
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,420
more and more winning

608
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,540
well gateway say all these japanese gods almost

609
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,380
They are all part of Yingong's faith

610
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,440
There are Yingong beliefs are

611
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,020
At least in the Mingyue area, there used to be

612
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,320
But how popular is Taiwan

613
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,360
Why Taiwan is so popular

614
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,900
because of Taiwan

615
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,680
this

616
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,220
special environment

617
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,520
There are many natural disasters in this Israeli society

618
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,100
so-called fighting spirit

619
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,440
For example, what are the most natural disasters in Taiwan?

620
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,220
You may think of an earthquake

621
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,000
earthquake

622
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,300
It's been a long time since this severe earthquake

623
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,340
But every year there are

624
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,640
in the previous era

625
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,960
disaster is easy

626
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,260
this happens

627
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,040
It's just that the family and life are gone.

628
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,100
In addition, Taiwan has many

629
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,380
Luo Han Ka

630
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,360
but come on

631
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,460
In fact, it can't be sucked

632
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,960
Can't take extra coupons

633
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,120
And of course alone

634
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,440
may come by accident or poverty

635
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,640
starved to death in the countryside

636
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,900
i was found one day

637
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,080
There's a lot of bitterness left

638
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,800
That's because there are many natural disasters

639
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
so often

640
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,560
There is a saying called chasing interest

641
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,640
where the collar will find a dead body

642
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
whatever the reason

643
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,160
then i found this

644
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,160
common man criminal

645
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,000
must hurry to bury him

646
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,840
after burial

647
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
buried well

648
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,960
and because he didn't know

649
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,840
what is his history

650
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,160
don't know how he died

651
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,240
So it's best to do it for him

652
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,600
If you don't feel comfortable

653
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,720
lazy again

654
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,600
what else

655
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,360
Just build a small temple

656
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,920
just start

657
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,120
Then a Yongyin Temple appeared

658
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,400
So the number of Yongyin Temples in Taiwan

659
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Much

660
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,840
and very common

661
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,480
preferably

662
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,760
Then worship and become a god

663
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,220
I can bless you after becoming a god

664
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,720
keep bless us

665
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
keep smoking

666
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
and can even get you this

667
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Get rich

668
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
That

669
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,720
these japanese gods

670
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
almost

671
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,720
public faith

672
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
part of form

673
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
good

674
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
this is

675
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
closer to us

676
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Hsinchu Orchid has a small temple

677
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Holy Army

678
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
what's in here

679
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
this is japan

680
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
everyone see

681
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
Japanese style clothing

682
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
this is the original

683
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,720
stone bow

684
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
means land bow

685
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
This is a soldier from Taiwan who went to fight in Nanyang

686
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
after the war died

687
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,720
returned ashes

688
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
also put here

689
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
So there are several elements

690
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
will be added together

691
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
They built a sanctuary

692
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
bring these

693
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
It is a temple with Yin Gong

694
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
Because the person who brought it is God

695
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
And this why there are Japanese soldiers

696
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
here

697
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
The war will start because he is close to Hsinchu House Airport

698
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,360
U.S. bombing

699
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,100
Japanese soldiers working there were killed

700
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,400
It's nearby, so they locals take that

701
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,400
Collect the body and bury it here, after the burial

702
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,400
Let him do the tax, so build a small temple to handle it

703
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,900
Then this original

704
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,900
The boulders worshiped by the Hakka people are also included

705
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,800
this is later

706
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,200
After being put together, one day next to this small temple

707
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,200
There is a private person who is rich, and his family worships

708
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Mother Chitose

709
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,000
He doesn't know why he developed, and then he built a big temple called

710
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Dai Tianfu came to worship his loving mother Qiansui

711
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,400
Therefore, a relatively large temple was built next to the Holy Army Hall

712
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,300
Let’s just say that you, Yungong Temple, are all too low-level.

713
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,900
Ours is a loving mother, Chitose is a prince

714
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,100
So you are in the Regulatory Affairs Hall, so this Holy Army Hall

715
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,400
It became an affiliated temple of Dai Tianfu

716
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,500
The planning hall, the current shape has become like this

717
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This is Zhengpuxiang, Chiayi County, there is a village called Shengkeng Village

718
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
He has a village temple called Kaifenggong, and the temple on Xuannan Island

719
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
He worships five thousand years old, you nest for two or two days, even the Holy Mother and so on

720
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The most special thing is that there is a temple called Zhongying in the left front of their temple.

721
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Generally, temples in Taiwan have a concept called five battalions of soldiers and horses to protect this sacred space.

722
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Our real personnel, whether it is the police or the army, bless you for the peace of this area

723
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
In the sacred space, in the space of the gods, there is a similar concept

724
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So there are five battalions defending the village

725
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
To put it simply, there used to be many temples, a village temple, he had his sphere of influence called sacrificial village

726
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The meaning of sacrificial village is that the god of this temple is going to celebrate his birthday, and if everyone wants to pay, he will pay the money

727
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
good top

728
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,840
So what good do you have?

729
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,240
statement to protect you

730
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,440
this is your benefit

731
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,040
You can invite the gods back to your home to do it

732
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,320
you have this right

733
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,980
but to act

734
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,160
bye bye

735
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,320
Everyone wants to pay together

736
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,600
you have to donate

737
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,760
That's called sacrificial power

738
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
Simply put, this is called sacrificial power

739
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,320
The sacrificial right belongs to the god hall of this village temple

740
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
How does he rule? How does he protect An Ming?

741
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,560
so he wants me five soldiers

742
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
doesn't matter

743
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,360
So East, West, North, South, Middle

744
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,760
This is an imitation of traditional Chinese military concepts

745
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,960
Usually the middle camp is the most important

746
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,760
Because Zhongying is in the middle of the village

747
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,960
or temple gate

748
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Zhongying is the most important

749
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
What is Yuansai in Zhongying?

750
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,160
Si San sent envoys

751
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,760
Elements of Zhongtan

752
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
Lee Roger

753
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,560
Generally, the middle camp looks like this

754
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
As a result, the middle camp of this temple

755
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,560
Zhongtan Yuansai is called Ice General Palace

756
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
is a japanese

757
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
so you see there's a japanese flag hanging here

758
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
inside inside

759
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,000
because of this place

760
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
Japan's era

761
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
There used to be soldiers and police who came here to block and steal

762
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,700
Many people died here

763
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,800
So the local people put these dead local people

764
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
offer up

765
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
put one of them

766
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,700
recruited as a soldier

767
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,200
become a substitute

768
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,700
This Nakato Motosuan

769
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,500
be here

770
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,800
In charge of soldiers and horses

771
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,500
This is the only one in Taiwan

772
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,000
Nakato Moto I have seen is considered a foreigner

773
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,700
across this

774
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,500
just that temple

775
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,700
The village next door is called the Three Layer Village

776
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Between these two villages there is a tax declaration

777
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,500
called a three-tier tax return

778
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,000
a tax crossing

779
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,000
there is a land cemetery

780
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
prisoner of war palace

781
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,000
this is earth palace

782
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,800
this is it

783
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,200
Another Japanese soldier

784
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,000
In fact, it is the same as the current one

785
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,560
The same series of Kaifeng workers are actually local

786
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,160
that is, the same area

787
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,080
The two villages worship their own

788
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,680
But it's actually the same thing that happens

789
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,160
Okay, here we are at Yile Military

790
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,360
real military operations happen to soldiers

791
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,320
make rotten then become god

792
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,360
in Taiwan's history

793
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,760
There are two big events

794
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,400
One is about Japan

795
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,200
One is 1895

796
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,400
When Japan comes to take over and rule Taiwan

797
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
because of some confrontation

798
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
Military action against the people of Taiwan

799
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,440
So of course people will die

800
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,280
Of course Taiwanese die more

801
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,800
japanese die very little

802
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,760
Japanese soldiers also suffered losses

803
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,320
these dead somewhere

804
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,760
I often hear that a person died in that place

805
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,800
japanese officer japanese soldier

806
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
Then afraid of him making trouble

807
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,320
so start him

808
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,600
Many Japanese lives are born in this way

809
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
so

810
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,840
See Tamiya without this

811
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,260
And after he took his feet, he automatically

812
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,660
upgraded to become

813
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,760
say he is this

814
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,120
he is already a thousand years old

815
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,480
netizen class

816
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,800
And he also said that his surname is Zhu Mingzheng, which of course is what Ji Tong said.

817
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,240
The Keeton that Keeton is going to talk about

818
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,240
The Japanese don't know why there is a Chinese-style name

819
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,680
Keeton said to probably send it off.

820
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,680
The inscription in the temple is sent like this

821
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
This is

822
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,720
There is a small temple in Xigang Zeng Wenxi Local Monument

823
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,080
Looking at the stele, you will know that this is the county of Yongyun Palace

824
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,480
Inside worship three Japanese pilots

825
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,200
It was around 1944

826
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,520
4445

827
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
In fact, Taiwan was bombed by the US military again.

828
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So Japan has the air force called the navy at that time

829
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,000
The Navy's pilot flight team will take to the skies to meet

830
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Of course they all hit a lot

831
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Now the plane hits down at this place

832
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Three people on the plane died locally

833
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The locals built a temple to worship them

834
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
This temple is very early, probably in the 50s to 60s

835
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
At the beginning, it should be called the Japanese Shogun’s Former Event Store.

836
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I don't know how to come up with the name

837
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But at that time, I felt that talking about Japanese generals

838
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
politically incorrect

839
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So remove that day

840
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's why it is now called the General's Former Events Store.

841
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
it's normal

842
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But now that temple is called General Ben’s Former Event Store

843
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Japanese locals, I will explain it to you with white eyes

844
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
This is also around the end of the war

845
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
A plane is going to Tainan Airport

846
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Then people in Tainan wait for that place to drop

847
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
There are 14 people on it

848
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
After death they worship them

849
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
There are two portraits

850
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I have 14 portraits

851
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I don't know how the name came from

852
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I think the same is what the chicken boy said

853
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
name him yourself

854
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So this must have been a humble small temple

855
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But later it gradually developed into a more decent

856
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Because there is such a supernatural legend

857
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Many of these temples are supernatural legends

858
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
And some are more and more powerful

859
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Many temples were later built bigger

860
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Sunnah

861
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Sunnah for everyone go full name tag

862
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
If you make a fortune, come and renovate a temple for him

863
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Below we will have an example of this

864
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
This temple is very remote

865
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
this is what the newspaper said

866
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Said 311 after the earthquake

867
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Many people suddenly come here

868
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
hope he

869
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
are you a japanese god ? hurry up

870
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
tie up you japanese safe

871
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
This is similar

872
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
also a plane crash

873
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Such supernatural legends

874
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
In particular, this is a similar

875
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
that is

876
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
These

877
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
so that the Japanese soldiers here

878
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
He can

879
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Possess

880
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Then you know that the soldiers and civilians in the single place have some strange phenomena

881
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
for example

882
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
don't speak japanese at all

883
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
He started speaking Japanese one day

884
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Of course it's nonsense

885
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
That short day everyone sounds like it's Japanese

886
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I can also sing Japanese songs

887
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
just believe this is

888
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
must be playing directly

889
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
doing something weird

890
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So just go when something like this usually happens

891
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I will definitely go to the big temple in Shandi

892
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
like that even bigger god

893
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
please tell me what the hell is going on

894
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Of course the gods will pass through the foundation

895
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
or through hands-on

896
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
then tell you

897
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Hurry up and build a temple now

898
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Bye bye you'll be fine

899
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Many small temples worshiping Japanese gods

900
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
that's how it all came about

901
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
this is not a soldier

902
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This is a Japanese supervisor in the original Baibenmen factory

903
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
it's called Q2

904
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
because at that time

905
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
on their own sign

906
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
There is a sign next to it

907
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So they worshiped a

908
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
used to work in this factory

909
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Factory director's Q yuan translation

910
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Actually it's Japanese Kanji

911
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
scrambled prefix an autumn Q

912
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
There is a place called Hagi on Sankou Line

913
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
its idiom is famous

914
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I guess this Q should come from this Q

915
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So let's call it Q2

916
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He said this Q2

917
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
this Q2

918
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This long one is outside this place

919
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So many locals love it

920
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Later he died here

921
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
later people will miss him

922
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's the same situation as that of Yiai Palace.

923
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
start worshiping him

924
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Gradually from a small temple to a chauvinistic temple

925
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
But then I check

926
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Wang Zhicheng, after we have the staff record of the Governor-General of Taiwan

927
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Our staff directory is a database

928
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
All publicly owned from elementary school under the Governor of Taiwan

929
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
As long as you have your name, you can look it up

930
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
let me check this guy

931
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
He wasn't dead in the time they say

932
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It was he who left this place later

933
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Because I met somewhere else

934
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
At least two years later he went to another place

935
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Now of course I don't know

936
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Maybe go back to Japan

937
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
but they say

938
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
How often he said or wrote like this

939
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
This is the man who died here to sense him

940
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
this is not important

941
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,880
it will have a japanese god bless people

942
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,220
this is more important

943
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,080
This is inside the fish farm

944
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,460
There is also a fish farm temple

945
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,120
It's also like this

946
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,620
There must be supernatural phenomena

947
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,940
This is a small temple in the fish farm

948
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,860
It is also a Yuwen Temple property

949
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,600
ok this

950
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,000
next this

951
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,200
Youyuwen Gong Temple has been upgraded

952
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,300
becomes a medium-sized temple

953
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,500
And it's very sunny now

954
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,200
Now maybe all of Taiwan

955
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,500
most famous in japan

956
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,800
A temple worshiping Japanese gods

957
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,700
This temple is in Annan District

958
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,900
Annan District, Taiwan

959
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,500
There is a big wild area called Haiwei

960
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,900
Haiwei is an old place name

961
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,200
There are now a total of seven lis in this giant warm corridor at the end of the sea.

962
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,100
you know how big its population is

963
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,700
At the end of the sea there is a big temple called Chaohuan Palace

964
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
The main god of Chaohuan Palace is Baosheng Dadi

965
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,000
that now

966
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,500
The original name of this temple is Zheng Nanpang

967
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,000
The locals commonly call it the Temple of the Flying Tiger General

968
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
This temple was also

969
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,500
It turns out that this place is full of fish farms

970
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
also the same

971
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And this, this is very specific

972
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
not a legend

973
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That is to say, the time, the young age, the person, who is the person

974
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
On this side, there's an air battle going on at this place

975
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
fierce air battle

976
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,000
This valley, Maofeng, this flying man

977
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
right around here

978
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
was shot down and died here

979
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
was twenty-one when he died

980
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,000
that, after death

981
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,500
At first, everyone thought it was unfair

982
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,000
and later on it started to appear

983
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
As I just said, someone rode a white horse in the middle of the night

984
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,500
Stories like this are everywhere

985
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,500
are all the same

986
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,500
then started thinking about

987
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Just ask Baosheng Dadi

988
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,500
I often ask Baosheng Dadi, and I say

989
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,500
that place

990
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,500
Of course not one

991
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
the flying man died there

992
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,500
everyone immediately remember

993
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,400
there is this

994
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,200
so hurry to that place

995
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,800
Build a small workshop and start

996
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,300
Bye to the 1980s

997
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,200
because Café de Coral

998
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,100
Everyone's Youth Card

999
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,800
Someone must get rich from this

1000
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,000
So this temple was refurbished to be very beautiful

1001
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,400
Then Caowan Palace put it

1002
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,200
Accepting it is equivalent to Jiaotou Temple

1003
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,700
It is a small settlement in this atmosphere

1004
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,000
inside a temple

1005
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,300
Caowan Palace unified to manage

1006
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,600
That

1007
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
because this

1008
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,800
The story is too specific

1009
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,000
That's because no one knows

1010
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,600
Because when the pilot fell

1011
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,900
His shoes have his name on them

1012
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,300
So it's easy to find out

1013
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,000
his coming

1014
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,200
where is he from

1015
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,700
He is a japanese paranoid nurse

1016
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,400
from a soldier

1017
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
a pilot

1018
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,100
then behind me

1019
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,600
I'll charge you a little more later

1020
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,060
things to go back to visit relatives

1021
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,900
You can take a look first

1022
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,700
Just now this is the appearance of the temple

1023
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,260
This whole look is like this

1024
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,060
what's in there

1025
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,840
his door

1026
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,900
General Flying Tiger

1027
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,440
his door

1028
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,740
hang this all year

1029
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,760
welcome

1030
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,780
Ladies and gentlemen, Japan

1031
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,100
Friends who rent a seat from Japan come here to pay homage

1032
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,380
use Japanese

1033
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,900
Because there are too many visitors from Japan

1034
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,540
On average I asked about 600 Japanese people a year recently

1035
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,820
come here

1036
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:40,180
Whether tourists or believers come, anyway, they will come here to visit or pay homage.

1037
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,000
About 600 or so in recent years

1038
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,800
So he will be

1039
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,340
This is his main hall

1040
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:48,380
His home is small here

1041
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,660
there is one

1042
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,480
Republic of China flag Japan flag

1043
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,240
Then

1044
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,520
this is his picture

1045
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,800
why this photo

1046
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,080
because later

1047
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,000
When you start building this temple, you will know my name when you know my name.

1048
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
Even this clue to check

1049
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,000
Find his information in Japan

1050
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Their

1051
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,100
as if his sister was still there

1052
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,500
decades ago

1053
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,900
So go to the photo provided

1054
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,300
So there is this in this temple

1055
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,900
this japanese town

1056
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,500
This photo of Flying Tiger General

1057
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Whistle

1058
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,800
Then

1059
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,400
because this

1060
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,000
The deity of this temple is very specific

1061
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,300
so

1062
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,800
easy to advertise

1063
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,800
make luggage

1064
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,000
So more and more Japanese will come

1065
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,700
By 2015

1066
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,600
This frequent Japanese

1067
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,600
they even

1068
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,100
They have an organization like the Continuous Workers' Association

1069
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,700
There are several chapters in Japan

1070
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,100
it's all about this

1071
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,300
This is related to the Temple of the Flying Tiger General

1072
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,700
they are

1073
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,900
in osaka

1074
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:51,500
exist

1075
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,000
exist

1076
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,700
There are still several in Kansai and Kanto

1077
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,200
this representative office

1078
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,500
then usually come

1079
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,100
sometimes contact each other

1080
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,120
They donated together

1081
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,820
they later found out that

1082
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,160
Neither of the classrooms of this restored general

1083
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,480
every March 15

1084
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,520
Avenue Palace is Baosheng Land

1085
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,560
when the christmas parade goes around

1086
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,120
Our recovery generals don't have classrooms to do

1087
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,400
I have to borrow someone else's classroom

1088
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,960
Squeeze in and teach with others

1089
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,520
So they decided to donate

1090
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,080
Just do a little Japanese-style Shintoism

1091
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,900
So in 2015

1092
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,940
Consecration is a Taiwanese concept

1093
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,000
There is no such thing as consecration in Japan

1094
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,060
But since the owner of the entry

1095
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,060
so after delivery

1096
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,380
Baosheng Land

1097
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:38,920
should say

1098
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,520
Duke Cao's mage performed a consecration ceremony for him

1099
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,060
then Japan

1100
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,340
also invited one

1101
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,860
Priest of the shrine

1102
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,680
Come do a ceremony

1103
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,480
this chinese style

1104
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,020
Japanese style is done

1105
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:57,860
Then I also participated in Taoism that year

1106
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
this was two years ago

1107
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
well , a funny thing happened last year

1108
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Because many Japanese people come

1109
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
So this temple civilization is because there were several Japanese writers later

1110
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Cleverly introduce this temple and write the story of this person

1111
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
This Japanese man has become a god here

1112
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Worshiped like this by Taiwanese

1113
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So more Japanese will come to see

1114
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Well, there was a Japanese female writer last spring

1115
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Suddenly came to the Temple of General Flying Tiger

1116
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
He told the people in the temple

1117
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
This Flying Tiger General holds a dream

1118
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Tell me he wants to go back to the bible

1119
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
He wants to go back to Japan to have a look

1120
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
He's already, you see 1944

1121
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
by 2016

1122
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's been a few years since I went back

1123
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
so he wants to go back and have a look

1124
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Well, if you want to go back, of course you have to form a group

1125
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
which god is going out

1126
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
that will cost a lot of money

1127
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,460
So the chairperson of Prince Cao is Wu Jingci

1128
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:08,960
He thinks it's more prudent

1129
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
so he said

1130
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,460
because of what you said

1131
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,840
I'm already in the temple baby

1132
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,340
get three holy splendor

1133
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,840
It's true that I'm not lying

1134
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,720
The head committee member of that temple said it was insincere

1135
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,000
only if i come

1136
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,720
so he said i come baby

1137
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,000
see if it's true

1138
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
he started really started baby

1139
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Eight times in a row are holy brilliance

1140
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
this is weird

1141
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
This should not exist in terms of mathematical memory.

1142
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
but there is

1143
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Then after getting eight holy radiances

1144
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
The chairman said

1145
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Ringo baby

1146
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
He said what if the ninth is Shenghui again?

1147
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Nine is the emperor's honor

1148
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
He said that our Shenghui is lonely and tall

1149
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
can't get to this

1150
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
us

1151
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,400
Netizens are not enough

1152
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,840
how can i use wine

1153
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,840
so

1154
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,360
For fear of nine hymns in a row

1155
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,360
He stopped at eight

1156
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,720
This is the chairman

1157
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,300
I'm going to visit him

1158
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,820
He himself said he wouldn't lie

1159
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,820
i know i have known him for many years

1160
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,100
So they really go back in September

1161
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,980
26 people formed a group to go back

1162
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,520
Go back to visit relatives with the idol

1163
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,600
to visit his hometown

1164
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,660
Because he, the Flying Tiger General

1165
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,160
there are some relatives

1166
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,060
so to his hometown

1167
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,860
Water nurses go around the border

1168
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,880
didn't hear the rain

1169
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,900
i watched that video

1170
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,360
wow, that's a lot of people

1171
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,560
at home

1172
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,180
Still borrowing the religion of the single place

1173
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,540
Japanese religion

1174
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,040
Detour as a water nurse

1175
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,180
then go to his two schools

1176
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,680
He went to two primary schools and went back to visit

1177
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,480
school closed

1178
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
First open the door over there to welcome the seniors

1179
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
The best part is the latter

1180
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,540
Then until September 24th

1181
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,040
they are going to tokyo

1182
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,540
why go to tokyo

1183
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,540
Because actually going through Tokyo

1184
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,540
Mingoya

1185
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,540
because of this

1186
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,540
when you sit down say

1187
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,100
When the general of Huifu left with me

1188
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,600
in my dream

1189
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,600
Mount Fuji keeps appearing

1190
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Maybe he wants to see Mount Fuji

1191
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
so

1192
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
In order to let the general of the Huifu

1193
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
this wish

1194
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
so they start with

1195
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Because Cicheng County is in the northeast of Tokyo

1196
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
To go to the mainland through the northeast

1197
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Go to Mingoya to see Mount Fuji

1198
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
So that day is to

1199
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
going to see mount fuji

1200
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Mito

1201
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
take a ride

1202
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
when going to tokyo

1203
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
that's the line

1204
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
What about the express car of this RR?

1205
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's just that it doesn't stop at every station.

1206
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Many stations are non-stop

1207
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
to this

1208
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
The second rendering of the map city

1209
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
There is a station called Arakawa Oki Station

1210
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
should pass

1211
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
is non-stop

1212
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
This station is non-stop

1213
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
As a result, it stopped suddenly before passing the station.

1214
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
on emergency braking

1215
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
like emergency braking

1216
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
just stopped suddenly

1217
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
just stopped suddenly

1218
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
That

1219
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
where they walked together

1220
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
There is a president of a Japanese mountain club

1221
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It's called Dachuan Yanqi Line

1222
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Is to follow them all the way to receive them

1223
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
just go with them

1224
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
He's sitting right across from that god's box

1225
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
he finds it strange

1226
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
why don't you stop at this stop

1227
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and not stop at the station

1228
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
stop outside

1229
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
So he went to ask the train conductor

1230
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
you do not know

1231
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
The car stopped suddenly

1232
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,540
The car later had Guangdong

1233
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,320
Because I'm going to tell the police why I stopped

1234
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,040
because there shouldn't be parking

1235
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,620
He said because there is a level crossing ahead

1236
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,440
there seems to be something

1237
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,840
let's pause

1238
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,960
But it's not the reason

1239
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,460
just don't know why stop

1240
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,120
After the big rumorer went to ask

1241
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,580
When he came back it suddenly occurred to him to say

1242
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,660
this place

1243
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,800
parking place

1244
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,640
It was the mountain spectrum back then

1245
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,260
Brave the wind, the birthday star's Canyon Starfish Air Force

1246
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,520
next to

1247
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,340
As far as he started to go

1248
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,880
Before flying, birthday boy

1249
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,680
The first base is here

1250
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,720
I didn’t come to Taiwan until after the birthday party over there

1251
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,540
near the parking lot

1252
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,600
so this one

1253
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,640
President of Big Rumors

1254
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,200
This is according to Wu Jingci's description

1255
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,100
Came back and suddenly thought of this

1256
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,040
this point he said

1257
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,320
here is the canyon

1258
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,020
That's the one

1259
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,600
That flight base

1260
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
treatment

1261
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,820
So Lie Shi why is he listening here because

1262
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,620
General Flying Tiger wants to take a look and listen here

1263
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,980
He said he didn't believe in any gods

1264
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,620
he suddenly

1265
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,880
just stay

1266
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,500
Facing the voice of the Flying Tiger General, start

1267
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,680
keep playing keep playing

1268
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,760
This is not nonsense because this one

1269
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,520
big sailor president

1270
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,780
Posted this on his facebook that day

1271
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,300
jump on the net

1272
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,720
He told the story

1273
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,240
Mark the map, this is General Flying Tiger

1274
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,320
sit in this car

1275
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,160
this right

1276
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,560
For those of Prince Cao, this is called a supernatural deed.

1277
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,560
This is hard to explain, I don't know why

1278
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It may be accidental, the car just broke down

1279
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
but just by chance

1280
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
For happiness, that is not important

1281
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
this is supernatural

1282
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
not important to outsiders

1283
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
For them, they will be more difficult to get

1284
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
to market this temple

1285
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
to market this god

1286
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
this is a story

1287
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
But it's a true story

1288
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
nice story we people say

1289
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
similar to this

1290
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
General Flying Tiger , the pilot shot it down

1291
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
In fact, Pingtung also has a

1292
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Otherwise he is not as famous as General Flying Tiger

1293
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
He is a shikigami in the temple

1294
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
So a plane is provided

1295
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Just say Mita, what?

1296
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
But it's impossible not to know his name

1297
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Suddenly there is a big temple

1298
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
In fact, you have Yingong Temple

1299
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Don't think it must be small

1300
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
There is a big staff temple

1301
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
This staff temple

1302
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,500
It was built very large from the beginning

1303
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:06,020
Because this is the Wurengong Temple built by the Taiwan Municipal Government

1304
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,440
The reason why the temple of Wurengong was built is because

1305
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,160
in 1964

1306
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,320
This modern Zhongshan Junior High School

1307
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,720
It wants a sports factory to expand

1308
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,520
Then, because the school was located before, it became a kind of kind outside the gate.

1309
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,520
It's chaos

1310
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,800
so

1311
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,200
playground to be expanded

1312
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,900
The human bones of more than a thousand giants were actually dug up

1313
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,720
that's one of the few

1314
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,280
I know it's Japanese

1315
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,080
Because the packaging is different

1316
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
it's late

1317
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,380
then there is

1318
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,560
which since it is installed in that

1319
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,480
Tight knife

1320
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,600
inside that duck

1321
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,560
Another one with a name

1322
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,760
call auspicious words

1323
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,120
it's the name i've always known

1324
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,300
Then he said that because of this human bone

1325
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,840
this bone is too much

1326
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,840
Find a place to put it after digging it out

1327
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:09,000
After the bones appeared, all kinds of dreams began to appear. Everyone began to dream.

1328
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:17,000
That is to say, there is a general named Xie Yongchang in Zheng Chenggong's time

1329
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
That's why it's called Marshal Xiefu

1330
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Zheng Chenggong's department will not have a Xie Yongchang

1331
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Because we have to actually check

1332
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I guess most of them are also created

1333
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
not necessarily real

1334
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
There is another called General Zhao Sheng

1335
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
next to him

1336
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
this is a japanese

1337
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
So 332 represents

1338
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
built this staff temple

1339
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Judge the three of them

1340
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So he still uses the Japanese pretense

1341
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
dress up

1342
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
just started 1960s

1343
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
To build this temple is the same as the political correctness problem just mentioned.

1344
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,600
a japanese god

1345
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,800
so name him

1346
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,140
at the begining of

1347
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,420
that's all

1348
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,740
Jiyuan Elementary School teaches that it is called Xie Jiyuan

1349
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:13,060
So he is Xie Yongchang's deployment

1350
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,600
So let's surname Xie together

1351
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,120
So it's called Xie Jiyuan

1352
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,100
but you pay attention

1353
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:25,860
this temple

1354
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,620
his

1355
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,160
two pillars

1356
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,960
is to use pole and element

1357
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:30,720
beginning

1358
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,300
Jiyuan Xiaojiao

1359
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,600
So from the very beginning, I attached great importance to this Japanese

1360
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,880
this pants bone

1361
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,700
What about more than a thousand bones?

1362
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,500
Still behind this temple

1363
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,040
sue a big priest

1364
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:44,800
I put it over there

1365
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,080
because I went to see

1366
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,640
i did it last time

1367
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,920
when doing business

1368
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,280
As long as someone comes to look at that temple, people will come to ask

1369
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,040
What's your business

1370
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,120
I said no, I just came and took a look

1371
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,320
Are you from the National Social Security Bureau?

1372
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,820
Because their temple is built on the land of the state-owned election bureau

1373
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,320
state-owned electoral bureau

1374
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,320
now tell them

1375
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,020
before

1376
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,020
So the party-state part is not necessarily bad

1377
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,520
It used to be a part of the party and government

1378
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,720
so

1379
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,360
Tainan City Government

1380
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,860
Just built a temple as big as Yungong Temple

1381
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,860
built on the land of the state-owned electoral bureau

1382
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,860
Does the National Election Bureau have any comments?

1383
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,520
but now

1384
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,520
you are you and i am me

1385
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,020
The temples in the central area are clearly divided

1386
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,020
So the National Election Bureau

1387
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,520
come to the city hall

1388
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,520
The city government said that I am not using that land either.

1389
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,520
It's that temple, you go to that temple to ask for money

1390
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,520
That temple now has its own management committee

1391
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,520
So the chairman of the management committee has a headache

1392
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,520
He said the National Election Bureau said you were going to give us

1393
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,520
Tens of thousands of rent

1394
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,520
we have no money

1395
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,520
There will be no fire in this temple

1396
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,520
so he looked

1397
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,520
Some people think about it first

1398
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,180
The National Election Bureau wants to see

1399
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
to take back their temple property

1400
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
This is not well run

1401
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Okay, Kaohsiung and Pingtung also have a famous Japanese

1402
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Worshiping the Japanese gods

1403
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
This Fengshan now has a very beautiful temple called Baoantang

1404
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You will see those Hongmaogang security halls

1405
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Hongmao Port is a small port in Kaohsiung

1406
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
A former fishing village by the sea

1407
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Later, the port of Kaohsiung was expanded

1408
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
There must be the entire thousand villages of Hongmaogang

1409
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Some people led to Fengshan

1410
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Just in this place to restore the little temple where they used to be

1411
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
here to renovate

1412
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Don't call it renovation, rebuild it into a big temple

1413
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
The same name is Hongmaogang Security Hall

1414
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Hongmaogang Security Hall

1415
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
thanks

1416
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
It is more standard with Yin Gong Temple

1417
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
because they carry three bones

1418
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
first

1419
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Let's go out to Hong Kong zero one zero

1420
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,740
Japan picked up an ancient pulse in ten generations

1421
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,740
so come back

1422
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,740
When I came back, I confessed that I was called the Marshal of the Central Government.

1423
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:15,740
This second time is also suitable for the pre-war

1424
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,740
Kokufu Chitose

1425
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:21,740
Pick up a Skull Valley after the battle

1426
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,740
I don't know why it's called Marshal of the Haifu

1427
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:28,240
It is now the residence of the security group.

1428
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,980
I didn't know who he was

1429
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,980
Anyway, because the fish catcher picked up this thing

1430
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,480
I feel more peaceful when I go back.

1431
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,980
I hope there will be no accidents to defend the fish goods

1432
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:44,980
make a fortune

1433
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,980
and then later

1434
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,980
He actually said he picked it up for the last time

1435
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:51,480
Supreme Commander of Kaifu in Cranial Valley

1436
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Said that at the same time the captain of the Japanese warship

1437
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,220
Of course it was a dream or through the machine barrel

1438
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,220
and also said

1439
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,200
Adding it to Okinawa makes Ryukyu

1440
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,820
and it's clear

1441
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,020
I am the head of the No. 38 economy

1442
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,560
So "Red Maoya" in 1990 really

1443
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,720
Expanded

1444
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,280
Okinawa has one

1445
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,880
memorial pile reads

1446
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,760
There is a record that building 38 was integrated

1447
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,940
very scattered

1448
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,080
But what is Building No. 38?

1449
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,080
that's not an economy

1450
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,760
Zhengyang Special Agent Field

1451
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,260
Japan had suicide planes late in the war

1452
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:38,940
There are also suicide buildings

1453
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,480
very small

1454
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,100
One boat makes two people

1455
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,720
just to attack

1456
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,800
The economy of the US military and the Allies

1457
01:04:51,620 --> 01:04:54,020
So it's actually a very small boat

1458
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:55,680
but now

1459
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,560
how can our god make such a small boat

1460
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,080
So let's expand it

1461
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,400
it is a warship

1462
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,400
Warship 38

1463
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,400
So they have another 9 foot long

1464
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,900
How much is 9 feet? 270 cm

1465
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,600
Of course not too big

1466
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,600
But there must be officers and soldiers

1467
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,100
There were only 36

1468
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,300
I don't think it's enough

1469
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,600
72 now

1470
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,800
Actually that

1471
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,800
There are only two people on the Zhenyang Ship

1472
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:25,400
Then three days a month the horn will be blown

1473
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
It's better to play Japanese songs

1474
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,900
If you don't believe it, grow a 3.69

1475
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:32,500
I'm going to experience it too

1476
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,500
Then 2003, 2001, 2005

1477
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,500
They have formed three groups

1478
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Go to Jinxiang Shrine in Tokyo

1479
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,900
Because their main god is Japanese

1480
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,100
So Lin Yunchuan has a ranking in the Jin Kingdom God Society

1481
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,100
So go there Jinxiang

1482
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,700
In 2005, this time it was on Facebook

1483
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,700
I also saw their ad

1484
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,700
ok , this is the security team

1485
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,680
It has just been built, and it has only been built in the past two years

1486
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:09,680
According to their own words, this is your man Gallius

1487
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,480
I don't know, I don't know who designed this anyway

1488
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,720
In short, it is not purely Taiwanese or Chinese-style architecture

1489
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:23,920
The two dragon pillars at the front

1490
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,600
It was donated by the Japan-Taiwan Qingshan Yongxing and the Qingshan Yongxing Cultural Group, with words engraved on it

1491
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,400
Temples like this will have Japanese donations

1492
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Donate not much, but there will be

1493
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,880
The temple is also very interesting

1494
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,040
This is their Zhenyang Sword

1495
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,720
Zhenyang Special Factory, now called No. 38

1496
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,040
This is Taiwanese very creative

1497
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,160
Japanese is absolutely not written by me

1498
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,560
but it was written by me

1499
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,520
Nichang Gungang

1500
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,320
Japanese warship

1501
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
There are left and right writing here

1502
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,000
There is a Japanese-style Shinto religion in the temple

1503
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,500
The date changes every day

1504
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,500
It is to allow you to take photos and practice here when you come to visit or pay homage.

1505
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,500
know what day you came

1506
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,500
so this has the date on it

1507
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,000
I took the photo on March 14, 2016

1508
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,000
this temple is now

1509
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,500
i'm red

1510
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,500
Because the back cover of the temple is very beautiful this time

1511
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,000
Usually Japanese come

1512
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,500
There are several temples in the south that you will go to

1513
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,500
So after you visit General Temple, you will go to Baoan Hall

1514
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,500
After visiting the Baoantang, go to Pingtung

1515
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,500
The Southeast Palace introduced below

1516
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,500
Let's introduce a small temple first

1517
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,500
There are Japanese gods in the village

1518
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,500
in Donggang

1519
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,500
This Gonghe New Village is Dapeng Bay

1520
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,500
Next to it is the Military Military Village of the Air Force's system

1521
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,500
This must be an affair project

1522
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
He chose a Taiwanese wife

1523
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
This Taiwanese wife is trustworthy

1524
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So I opened a Buddhist temple at home

1525
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
opened the temple

1526
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
you don't mind

1527
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
This is

1528
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
The name of the dependent village

1529
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
then this

1530
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
An old house left from the Japanese era

1531
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
There are many air-raid shelters in the late battle village

1532
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
so this house

1533
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
There's a bomb shelter next to it

1534
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
He's right here in the bomb shelter

1535
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
This is the bomb shelter

1536
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
on this mountain

1537
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
divided now

1538
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Drawn a Japanese flag

1539
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Then he is here

1540
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
bomb shelter this place

1541
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
this is the bomb shelter

1542
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
everyone look at this

1543
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
on this mountain

1544
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
divided now

1545
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Drawn a Japanese flag

1546
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
so he's here

1547
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
bomb shelter this place

1548
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
this is the bomb shelter

1549
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
everyone look at this

1550
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
this is the bomb shelter

1551
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
this is the bomb shelter

1552
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Then gave the Japanese people a name

1553
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I don't know how to read this

1554
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
No one goes to worship, anyway, it is his private Buddhist hall

1555
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,000
In addition, Donggang also has a place called Linsheng Church.

1556
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
He turned out to be the Hall of Fire

1557
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Now a small building has been built in the place of Huozhan Hall.

1558
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
The same is the Yungong Temple

1559
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
same worship these

1560
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Japan in the Bashi Strait in the later stages of the war

1561
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Whether it's a cargo ship or a warship

1562
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Many were bombed by the U.S. military

1563
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
So in fact, there are a lot of Japanese in Bashi Strait, Warbashi Strait

1564
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So Taiwan is close to the place in Russia Ambi

1565
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
There is a Buddhist temple built by the Japanese

1566
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Worship these, he will come here every year to worship these undead

1567
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Like this is the fire battlefield that built him in Donggang

1568
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
When he comes to the meeting every year, he will make model gold coupons, so that the dead of the Japanese army can use them

1569
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Then these characters must have been mentioned by Keith

1570
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Just take a few Japanese names

1571
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
sorry

1572
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Well, this Dongyang Palace is a very special

1573
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
It still has Yinggong Temple, but it is very large

1574
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
This ginseng village of this house

1575
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
There is a bomb shelter in this place

1576
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It is generally called a bat cave, the house cave is very large, and there are many bats in it

1577
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And at his gate, there is a man's temple, called General Tanaka's Mansion

1578
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Why is it called General Tanaka's Mansion?

1579
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Because I heard that at the end of the war

1580
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
some japanese died

1581
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
come stand near here

1582
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
to worship these

1583
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Because the Japanese represent

1584
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So I took a Japanese name

1585
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
That's why it's called Shogun Tanaka

1586
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
This princess of Duke Dongrong

1587
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Dong Rong Gong is a private temple

1588
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
The princess named Shi

1589
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
He said she was in the 1980s

1590
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
about eight years

1591
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
She said she suddenly regained her spirit one day

1592
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
make her very uncomfortable

1593
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
She kept resisting but couldn't resist

1594
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
so and because dear

1595
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I have experienced it myself

1596
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
this deity japanese deity

1597
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Saying is an instruction

1598
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Many things come true

1599
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
so she started to believe

1600
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And then she's talking in her house, priest

1601
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
all these gods

1602
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
she wants to save the world

1603
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
So they usually say go to the altar

1604
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
called come out

1605
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
their word is sacrifice

1606
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Their pattern is very high

1607
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
the wonderful thing is

1608
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
he later

1609
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
After the altar is opened for sacrifice, there will be recovery

1610
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Because believers will give red envelopes

1611
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Let's ask Lin Yan

1612
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
He will pack a big red envelope

1613
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
So the economic situation started to improve

1614
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
After transformation, he started to build a temple

1615
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
East Dragon Palace

1616
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
At the beginning, his main god was Tanaka Goto

1617
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Why is the main god called Tanaka Goto?

1618
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
He said it was the god

1619
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
tell me his name

1620
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Then there are a few people who accompany me

1621
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
One is Minamimaki Nishida

1622
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Nanmoku Nishida is very famous

1623
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Former Governor of Taiwan

1624
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
actually

1625
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
It is not uncommon for Nanmu Xitian to also worship at the temple

1626
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
because when it was accepted in 1895

1627
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Nanmu Xitian led the Second Army

1628
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
on Wangnan East Road

1629
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
attack north

1630
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Beibeicun Company has a north-south attack

1631
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
If you want to be in Tainan, you will lose

1632
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So anyone who visits Liao Naiyu knows that Nan Musi pad

1633
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Moreover, Nan Musipad later went to the Sino-Japanese-Japanese-Australian War

1634
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
He also served as the governor of Taiwan, etc.

1635
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
so very famous

1636
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
but his status is absolutely high

1637
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
But only as an escort

1638
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
because the possessed person said his name was Tanaka

1639
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
what and what

1640
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't know the name

1641
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Because I actually asked this princess

1642
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Because she is no longer called Tanaka Goto

1643
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Sensing her main body again

1644
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
There are also a few ministers who say they are Tanaka Goto

1645
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
the name just started

1646
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
i think he went by himself

1647
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
There is a Ph.D. from the Institute of Democracy, National Chengchi University

1648
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Renmei

1649
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
When he is in 2020

1650
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Wrote a master's thesis

1651
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
may be the first

1652
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
The first survey of Japanese gods in Taiwan

1653
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It was written by a master student

1654
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
When he went to work as an employee to do surveys

1655
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
He just said he thought the three names

1656
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,760
So the name of Japanese civilization is a bit unnatural

1657
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,580
It just doesn't look like a Japanese name.

1658
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:08,580
It is the Japanese name given by the Taiwanese themselves.

1659
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,220
And tell the story from the start

1660
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,460
When this temple was built, of course his story must be told

1661
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:20,700
He said that all of them were with Tanakato

1662
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,700
The Wudanshe incident sent troops and they all died here

1663
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,700
Tanaka died then

1664
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
By 2006

1665
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,920
Their host changed his name to Tanaka Steel Works

1666
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,760
Tanaka Steel Works has its own people

1667
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,760
First Taipei County Magistrate

1668
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,260
Tanaka Steel Works

1669
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,260
When the Japanese took over Taiwan

1670
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,460
There are only three counties in Taiwan

1671
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,960
Taipei County Taichung County Tainan County

1672
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,820
The first Taipei county magistrate was Koko Tanaka

1673
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,020
Admiralty County

1674
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:54,020
Tanaka Steel Works was indeed in 1874

1675
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,020
Sending troops to Taiwan is coming

1676
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,220
then interactive war

1677
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,220
not interactive war

1678
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,440
Thought that the second year of Japan's war

1679
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,080
Tanaka Steel Works led troops to attack Penghu

1680
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,940
At that time, Taiwan had not given Japan

1681
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,820
Penghu was captured in March

1682
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:17,620
Tanaka Steel Works led the troops on four rear admirals

1683
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,460
led troops to besiege Penghu

1684
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:23,900
So I became the first county magistrate of Taipei County

1685
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,900
I think

1686
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:29,900
because later

1687
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,900
don't know who

1688
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,900
After textual research, it is said that

1689
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,900
there is indeed a tanaka

1690
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,900
But Tanaka Steel has this guy

1691
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:40,900
Totsu Tanaka invented this by himself

1692
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,900
so

1693
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,900
Not only Tanaka households were changed into Tanaka Steel Works

1694
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,900
And originally there was a central Sichuan

1695
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,900
this weird japanese name

1696
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,900
Naoki Honkawa

1697
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,900
there is such a person

1698
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:54,900
so

1699
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,900
don't know which one

1700
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,900
Those who have studied Taiwan history

1701
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,900
go may be pointing

1702
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:08,000
So we have to adjust it to be more convincing and persuasive.

1703
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
So the day of the real day came

1704
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Because at the beginning he said their Generalissimo Tanaka

1705
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Died here in 1874

1706
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
But in fact, Gosho Tanaka later went to be a member of the Aristocratic Movement Council

1707
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
After leaving Taiwan, he went back to Japan to become a member of the noble movement

1708
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
This is the temple he took the Japanese god

1709
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
But myths are created

1710
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
but create convincing

1711
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
unless you create a person who doesn't exist at all

1712
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
no one can question

1713
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Then you keep tying him to historical events.

1714
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
You have to find a real historical figure

1715
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
He has gone through such a process

1716
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,000
This is what Asean Palace looks like now

1717
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
The one in front of the ASEAN Palace was rebuilt in the past two years.

1718
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Behind him was a completely pure

1719
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
is a man's temple

1720
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,340
Then I guessed

1721
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:07,340
Did he suffer from that just now?

1722
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:09,840
The stimulation of Hongmaogang security group

1723
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,340
The security regiment is beautifully covered

1724
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,340
then business is good

1725
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,340
many people go

1726
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,340
So he put his name

1727
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,340
Japanese style

1728
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,340
a bit of Japanese society

1729
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,340
I know it's the Diet of Japan

1730
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,340
red chrysanthemum

1731
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,340
look here

1732
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,340
this is covered

1733
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,340
in this temple

1734
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,340
this is

1735
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,340
this is that

1736
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:37,340
Okazo Tanaka

1737
01:17:37,340 --> 01:17:39,340
Marshal Tanaka

1738
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,340
Originally the earliest

1739
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:43,340
is to do a

1740
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,340
Taiwan-style gods

1741
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,340
General Tanaka

1742
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,340
later

1743
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,340
Sister Hua, why is she called a Japanese god?

1744
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,340
So just rebuild and make a

1745
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,340
Japanese look

1746
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:57,340
This is very mussy point

1747
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,340
this is called

1748
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Okay, I think these are the representatives of Japanese gods.

1749
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
The reason why these Japanese gods were born

1750
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:21,000
In fact, it is consistent with the original national civil servants of the Taiwanese people who have a sense of urination.

1751
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
developed from there

1752
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's not that Taiwanese people particularly like Japanese gods or Japanese soldiers

1753
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
No, just treat them as meritorious service

1754
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It is a step forward with Taiwan and China.

1755
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Responsive faith actually starts with fear

1756
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
or to cheer up

1757
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Why does the big temple control these small temples with merits?

1758
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Because the gods with higher divinity are in Taiwan's view of gods

1759
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
able to manage or suppress

1760
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,500
Relatively low status, or this kind of ghosts become gods

1761
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,700
Non-orthodox god

1762
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:12,200
So I used to use urine called Yin pee Yinshen

1763
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,500
That is to say, it is not a righteous god

1764
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,500
It was built between ghosts and gods

1765
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,300
that ghost can become a god

1766
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,000
ancestors died

1767
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Actually become a ghost

1768
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
generalized ghost

1769
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,800
But because you have descendants to worship

1770
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,600
So it doesn't really become a ghost

1771
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,600
one day it will pass

1772
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,100
may become a god going to heaven

1773
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,600
This is the general traditional concept of ghosts and people in Taiwan

1774
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:37,600
that's how it came

1775
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,600
This is how the concept of ghosts and gods came about

1776
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,100
Because of the special environment in Taiwan

1777
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,100
so from fear you need

1778
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:46,100
from fear to fear

1779
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,600
From the soul

1780
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,600
Overcome this later

1781
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,600
And then hope and pray

1782
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,600
to pray for their blessing

1783
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,100
So will develop the whole

1784
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,100
faith in fairness

1785
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:00,100
Chiayi has a place

1786
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,020
There is a very special photocopy palace temple

1787
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:04,020
very small

1788
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:07,580
please god god i can't remember

1789
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:10,740
But when his god was born

1790
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,180
Usually we call

1791
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:14,740
acting hater

1792
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,100
When the god is born, there will be a canopy show

1793
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,820
Whether it's a bad show or a song boy show

1794
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:23,640
The most special place in that temple is

1795
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,320
The day the god was born

1796
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,960
About

1797
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,320
Two or three hundred canopies are not a big deal

1798
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,820
Line up along the road

1799
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:34,500
not along the road

1800
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,540
Straight row

1801
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,680
Those who are not very good play music over there

1802
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,940
because no one is watching

1803
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,440
No one actually went there to act

1804
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,800
It's just a bad car

1805
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,240
Then set up the set

1806
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,080
right there

1807
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,080
just someone

1808
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,320
this votive

1809
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,480
donate money

1810
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:50,840
every year

1811
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,320
I haven't studied it

1812
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:54,160
but i saw it once

1813
01:20:54,160 --> 01:20:54,800
startled

1814
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,480
want to say what's going on

1815
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,920
This is also what I have

1816
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Taiwanese society has many unique features

1817
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Okay, the Japanese gods just mentioned

1818
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
In fact, most of it has to do with the war

1819
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
The concept of Taiwanese people's belief in Yungong is

1820
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Actually don't care that you are the god of the country

1821
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
As long as you die unexpectedly, it's important

1822
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
or unknown

1823
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Then you showed up near my house

1824
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I must help you worship Chaodu

1825
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
let you upgrade, you come to dress up

1826
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
general social psychology

1827
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
This social psychology existed 3,000 years ago

1828
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
After 3000 there will still be

1829
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
So this block of folk belief is definitely not going away

1830
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Science is flourishing and civilization is developing

1831
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
more books

1832
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
When you meet the trapped shield one day

1833
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Tell you it might be the one next to your house

1834
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
If you are lucky, you didn't go to worship

1835
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
then you will definitely go to worship

1836
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Do you want to believe it or not

1837
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,160
but i have nothing to lose

1838
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,460
so go ask

1839
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,120
It's really good to say goodbye

1840
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,700
will have such a mentality

1841
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,080
So Taiwan's Youyin apartment medicine

1842
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,300
Later, there will be Japanese

1843
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,760
A tenth degree of eternal change in nature

1844
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,600
produced

1845
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:18,920
not really taiwanese

1846
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,240
I especially like the Japanese

1847
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,760
nothing to do with this

1848
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,200
so

1849
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,840
Hengchun has one

1850
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,000
Yong Yin Po

1851
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,600
This is also a legend

1852
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,520
But it's not true, I don't know

1853
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,360
It is said that it will lead to misfortune

1854
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:36,640
Of course it's possible

1855
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,840
times in the netherlands

1856
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,720
It is rumored that there was a disaster there

1857
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,960
There's a Dutch lady on it

1858
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,360
dead

1859
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:46,560
so they put her on the spot

1860
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,680
bought

1861
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,640
then start doing

1862
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,840
The same is Indian apartment medicine

1863
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,960
what i just said

1864
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:58,120
That is to say, the Chinese people were corrupted by ghost officials

1865
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,080
Taiwanese because of the sensory ghost civil servant

1866
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And for a religion that has produced so many Japanese gods

1867
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
The Psychology That Generates Pagan Religious Needs

1868
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Let me give you an example

1869
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
In 1949, Qianan Palace in Westport

1870
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Xigang Thousand Shore Palace is very famous in Taiwan.

1871
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
National Folklore, Female Three-Year Teachers in Xigang

1872
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Did you hear about it in the official website just now?

1873
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
The Democratic Party is very special

1874
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
When the church was established in 1949

1875
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
he has a rod

1876
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
is a notice

1877
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Tell me why this year

1878
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Why do we need to build this teaching

1879
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
The most interesting here are these

1880
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
we are for

1881
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Chaoba Dadong has a war

1882
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Air Mountain Army

1883
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
fallen soldiers

1884
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It is difficult to defend the country and the Ganyi Party

1885
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
and innocent people

1886
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
we're all included

1887
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Also beware of excess

1888
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
So regardless of status, regardless of country

1889
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
regardless of ethnicity

1890
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
As long as there is war in Dadong

1891
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
The Great East Asian War is actually in Japanese

1892
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Can't speak Chinese nouns

1893
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Anti-Japanese will not talk about the Great East Asian War

1894
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Great East Asia War is a Japanese noun

1895
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Because Taiwan came from there

1896
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Or about the Great East Asian War?

1897
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
land, sea and air attack

1898
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Crit is also in Japanese

1899
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
customary terms

1900
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
soldiers of the armed forces

1901
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
all blah blah

1902
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
At this time, Lianli thinks about democratic operation

1903
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
also by the way

1904
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
This is a standard

1905
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
this is written by a Taoist priest

1906
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
access

1907
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Just tell me why we did it this time

1908
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Such

1909
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
The teaching of Jianjiao is

1910
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Large

1911
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Consciousness of sacrifice

1912
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
I would say the point is

1913
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
such a mentality

1914
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
fear fear like this

1915
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
there are so many

1916
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
because of the war

1917
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Due to various disasters

1918
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
people we need

1919
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
fuck them

1920
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Otherwise, it will be a very heavy society

1921
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
The burden of the crowd will be related to ghosts

1922
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,000
This is the pie I just commissioned, in case you can’t see it clearly, so I zoomed in on it

1923
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Next, I want to quickly introduce our Japanese-style array

1924
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
In addition to making a statement, there is now a trend

1925
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
In some places, Japanese-style arrays are popular

1926
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
The head of the battle is the group performing at the temple fair

1927
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Wait a minute our time will be up so I'm going to speak very quickly

1928
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I give two, one is called

1929
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
It's related to the magic driving show

1930
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
The other one is about cabaret

1931
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
The previous one is related to the magic driving show

1932
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:54,000
It's also a continuation of this tradition that is basically the Japanese era

1933
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Japanese Shrine Statement in Japan

1934
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,180
The gods of nearby Taiwan are usually invited to celebrate

1935
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,580
palace temple

1936
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:06,940
God also came out

1937
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,100
come out

1938
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:13,640
So now we can all find films from the 1930s, 40s

1939
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:19,280
You can see many gods and gods in Taiwanese temples will come out and have fun together

1940
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:22,020
habit like this

1941
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:26,820
This is a primary school student in Changhua Lugang in 1959

1942
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,100
Japanese shikigami

1943
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:29,900
this is not very clear

1944
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,940
Wear this costume in Japanese style

1945
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,340
The most famous one is actually in Kaohsiung

1946
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,900
identify the area

1947
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,200
Downstream of Round Creek on the second floor

1948
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:45,760
first appeared

1949
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,540
yes

1950
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,340
Yu Yu

1951
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:49,860
Yu Yu

1952
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:50,620
Mickey

1953
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,160
is Japanese

1954
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:53,440
is god

1955
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,980
this god

1956
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,520
Shenyu is the religion

1957
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,060
discharge out parade

1958
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
That

1959
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,280
It is expected that the Japanese-style front map we know now is probably the earliest.

1960
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,060
I want details without telling

1961
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:18,300
the most important thing is to say

1962
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,540
his form follows

1963
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,560
The now more famous Bayley's is different

1964
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,580
But I think he's still older

1965
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,780
because of him

1966
01:27:28,780 --> 01:27:33,280
The form of performance is relatively simple

1967
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,220
then he has no music

1968
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,220
his music is

1969
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:37,540
to sing by myself

1970
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,840
what song

1971
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:39,860
this song

1972
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,660
It is the song to be sung at the annual festivals of Taiwan shrines

1973
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,260
This is clothing from the 1990s

1974
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:48,260
depression team

1975
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:53,540
This is the Depression team performance I went to film in 2008

1976
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:57,540
Let's show you a video

1977
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
girl

1978
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,060
thank you

1979
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,000
girl

1980
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
girl

1981
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
girl

1982
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,300
He rarely...

1983
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,800
It's definitely time for you to attack the corner

1984
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,760
should be...

1985
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,160
do you know he plays

1986
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,260
he is here

1987
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,260
he is here

1988
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,560
he had that sport

1989
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,160
yes, this...

1990
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,200
it's all in there

1991
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,100
they get A's

1992
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:13,960
this file number

1993
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,800
Will there be a formal one?

1994
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:17,660
he felt the time was short

1995
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:19,660
He has vision time

1996
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:24,360
There are 24, 25

1997
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,160
Then there are 24, 25

1998
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,760
kid

1999
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,760
this is not your horn

2000
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Old Fast Hey

2001
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:35,340
Old Gao

2002
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,300
lens

2003
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,200
On the Press small screen

2004
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,800
He said 15

2005
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,800
So what does he mean by being funny now?

2006
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,720
Everyone must hear this song

2007
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,140
Wait a minute and change the song they sing

2008
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:08,140
you feel like hearing again

2009
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:12,480
The song they sang is the song of the Taiwan shrine

2010
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,480
this song

2011
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,480
Everyone must hear this song

2012
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,480
Wait a minute and change the song they sing

2013
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,480
you feel like hearing again

2014
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,480
The song they sang is the song of the Taiwan shrine

2015
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,480
everyone heard

2016
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:43,480
Song

2017
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,480
This is their elementary school

2018
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,480
middle school singer

2019
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,480
please listen

2020
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,480
mostly foreign

2021
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,480
Let's watch this elementary school song

2022
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,480
This shrine is going to be in this place

2023
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
but represents the pair of mysterious nouns

2024
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
This is the closest

2025
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
he was thinking

2026
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
very showy

2027
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,500
It's Japanese gods

2028
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:30,500
It is the mysterious term of the Japanese Church

2029
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,500
Their performance is actually very simple

2030
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,500
But it's fun

2031
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
They just sang this song.

2032
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
This is the Taiwan National Anthem.

2033
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
The Taiwan National Anthem's annual ceremony is on October 28th.

2034
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
The whole Taiwan is going to be on holiday.

2035
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
The kids are going to be on holiday.

2036
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
This is the time to celebrate and sing this song.

2037
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,000
When I first heard them sing, I didn't understand what they were singing.

2038
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I asked a 70-year-old teacher.

2039
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I said what are you laughing at?

2040
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
you say

2041
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I have no idea

2042
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
we used to

2043
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
It is passed down from generation to generation by the previous family

2044
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
but i know he just said

2045
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
He knows the first sentence is called

2046
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Wait a minute, Mazu has old people

2047
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I said

2048
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I'll record it once you sing it

2049
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Wait a moment

2050
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Wait a moment

2051
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
this is what we see

2052
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Taiwan Times reporter song was sung like this by him

2053
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
he doesn't know what he's singing

2054
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But take that tape

2055
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
From generation to generation

2056
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
from the 1950s

2057
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
We are now from the 1920s

2058
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
He is still singing, and every kid has to sing

2059
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Later, I finally found the genuine version, let me show you

2060
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,000
My name is my lord, the lord of the Jun family

2061
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Someone should know the two gentlemen. He is my recent colleague.

2062
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Recently, the researcher Mr. Huang Fujing retired

2063
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Because I think there must be something wrong with this song, I need to ask him

2064
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
As soon as he heard it, he said this when I was in elementary school

2065
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,000
I have to sing it once a year, I'll come and I'll sing it for you

2066
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Central will sing the first season of Taipei

2067
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,600
Because it has reached the end of the war and can no longer be tolerated in Taiwan

2068
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,500
So I changed it to Cup Old Street made by Grandma Curry

2069
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,500
very interesting

2070
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,600
Like I just said, empty door flower breakfast at night is empty door flower

2071
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:29,500
Okay, let's introduce another similar

2072
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,200
appeared a few years later than him

2073
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:36,500
Then I think the south and north sides of the second floor of the gate are in the bay of Tainan City.

2074
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:40,800
Wanniandian in this area builds a school every 12 years

2075
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,300
It is determined that teaching will be established once every 10 years or so

2076
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:49,500
The biggest feature of this area is that it has a lot of soil-like shock heads

2077
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,500
Until recently, people in the village organized it themselves

2078
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:57,500
then come out and circle into the show

2079
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:00,000
This is hard to find in Taiwan now.

2080
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,320
So they were in the same class as their elementary and middle school classmates that day

2081
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,140
Students and classmates went to participate in the front performance

2082
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:12,360
The Outer Years Electricity Corps started in 1954

2083
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,780
It was expanded in 1962

2084
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:18,640
and it continues until now

2085
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:20,080
never stopped

2086
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,080
only comes out every 12 years

2087
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,640
This is the most gorgeous front in Taiwan

2088
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,340
You can take a look

2089
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:29,680
he is already

2090
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,560
Because I wrote this

2091
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:33,560
The person who made up this array is

2092
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:37,560
At that time, there were four people who had read

2093
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,800
in the bay

2094
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:39,880
eel's

2095
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,920
fish rice

2096
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,080
But they are doing wholesale

2097
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:44,200
have read

2098
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:48,680
Then let me give you a little explanation

2099
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:52,360
His soundtrack is more particular

2100
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:55,640
There is also this Yuyu performance

2101
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:59,160
Then later added the Japanese Wu

2102
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,600
I think he improved on the top version

2103
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,400
more professional and better looking

2104
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:10,500
he has three dances

2105
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,100
wait a minute we'll show you one

2106
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:20,480
In fact, we see that there is only one paragraph in the relationship.

2107
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,560
let me explain to you first

2108
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:37,940
This is the Yutuan in Wanli. When they go out, there are seventy or eighty people in this group, and there are close to 100 people.

2109
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,820
This is a temple city. You can see that there is a stage here. The stage is facing the gate of the temple.

2110
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:48,940
Standard he these nice big penetrations are fine

2111
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,520
he performed

2112
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:57,900
This is the outskirts of the village after he came in

2113
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,200
This is the gate of Damiaocheng Temple

2114
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
they are here

2115
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,300
He must go around first

2116
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,020
and then come in from the middle

2117
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,080
The official performance is tentatively scheduled to begin

2118
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,460
This is his standard specification

2119
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:12,680
If it's a real formal performance

2120
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,700
Three paragraphs and five paragraphs must be performed

2121
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:18,200
wait a minute is a show

2122
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,420
Because he went around and passed through this temple

2123
01:38:20,420 --> 01:38:21,700
and in a hurry

2124
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:23,420
so just a song and dance

2125
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
good

2126
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,800
Then we got a little familiar with the song

2127
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,140
Because we are going to primary school

2128
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:46,740
I sang this song in music class

2129
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:48,300
Shu Wu Muran

2130
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,000
he wants to go around first

2131
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,800
Excuse me

2132
01:38:57,800 --> 01:38:59,800
A few old gentlemen will be able to serve

2133
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Founding

2134
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,800
When I went that time

2135
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:03,800
The four founding members

2136
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:04,800
still business

2137
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,800
commercial almost eighty years old

2138
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,200
walk in this scene

2139
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:09,200
In fact, they are very proud

2140
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:11,000
They created a political arena

2141
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Since 1994

2142
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,900
this is the first

2143
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:19,600
Xie Lang

2144
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:20,600
Koro

2145
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:22,900
There will be side covers inside

2146
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:25,300
Jin Xiang Yuan

2147
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,400
his flag doesn't matter

2148
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,800
because the flag is in the middle

2149
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,900
The sides are their alignment

2150
01:39:30,100 --> 01:39:33,300
People in this place are very patriotic

2151
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,100
when traveling here

2152
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:34,460
First

2153
01:39:34,460 --> 01:39:35,600
walk ahead of the line

2154
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,000
Another flag

2155
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,500
But they are at most this homestay

2156
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,300
In fact, it is for

2157
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,200
recoil

2158
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:48,700
it's folk wisdom

2159
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:49,500
because this is

2160
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,500
they are familiar

2161
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,300
I like it very much

2162
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,900
think it looks good

2163
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:53,800
politics

2164
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:57,200
But in the 1950s and six years

2165
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,000
anti-democratic atmosphere

2166
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
very romantic

2167
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,260
under this circumstance

2168
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:03,020
This is a very change of seasons

2169
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:04,860
So they figured out a way

2170
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:06,400
first interval

2171
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,120
Because the previous director was an interval

2172
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,700
This is really from the unit until now

2173
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:10,700
with no change

2174
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:15,500
Why did you choose Shu Ao Luren?

2175
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:16,220
I started

2176
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:18,660
I'm thinking now, too, for the first time

2177
01:40:18,660 --> 01:40:19,660
Why is it because of patriotism

2178
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:22,760
Not only every other period, but also sing Chinese private

2179
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,860
Or ask someone from your choir

2180
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,600
They are actually very particular about sound

2181
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:32,100
They chose this song because of his rhythm

2182
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,300
suitable time to enter

2183
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:36,600
very slow

2184
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:38,600
he is rhythmic

2185
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,300
Sound and rhythm are considered

2186
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,260
no choice

2187
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:44,160
Then he didn't know that this was called Shu Aolu

2188
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,360
because of this song

2189
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,300
In 1933 there was a record company in Taiwan

2190
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:49,040
called

2191
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:49,800
Colombia

2192
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,100
Gullenmea

2193
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:53,300
released an album

2194
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:56,560
It's a vocalist from Tainan named Lin Shihang

2195
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:57,460
Sing

2196
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
this song turned into a song

2197
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
A love song called civilized love

2198
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
is a love song

2199
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So they choose civilized love

2200
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
let's make this background music

2201
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I didn't know this was Su Wu Festival

2202
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
ok, after coming in

2203
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
they have three shows

2204
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
this is part of it

2205
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
called fish three dance

2206
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I'm afraid to call this Yu Sanwu

2207
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
But this show is already a classic

2208
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
the first thing i saw was a fish

2209
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
they are professional fish

2210
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I didn't expect that they were all local gentlemen.

2211
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Mainly there are masters in middle schools, public schools, and cities

2212
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Twenty dancing ladies are golden cats playing blood

2213
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
after dancing

2214
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
golden wheel four

2215
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
skip to twenty

2216
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Bend this area

2217
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
A total of nine female

2218
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
a big conflict

2219
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
now later population show

2220
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
now i have six

2221
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
good

2222
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
A prop is very particular

2223
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
This is Li Long's premium product

2224
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
one thousand dollars to buy

2225
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
no one bought it for you

2226
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I'm wearing this

2227
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Taiwan is called Tabit

2228
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
The Japanese of the Japanese era is called the main generation

2229
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
He is lost

2230
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
This is specially made

2231
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
because the shoes are not available now

2232
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I was supposed to wear the splints.

2233
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
The kind worn in Japanese ensembles

2234
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
But they want to bypass the ticket

2235
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I've been wearing it for too long and I'm uncomfortable

2236
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
so hurry up

2237
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
rush through this

2238
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
This is a shoe from the Japanese era

2239
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Also pinched

2240
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
it dance too

2241
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
What we usually see with the eyes

2242
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
is very brief

2243
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
is a girl

2244
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,500
Look at that little girl just now

2245
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:03,360
decide on the brand

2246
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,140
It's all fake

2247
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:05,840
when they look in the mirror

2248
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,600
wear that too

2249
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,160
will be full of hard work

2250
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:09,660
And hand fog

2251
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,840
It turned out to be only this

2252
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,600
It's you who pity this

2253
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,500
Theologian

2254
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:27,160
This is the family background

2255
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Many people should know this song

2256
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
almost nothing

2257
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
what is singing

2258
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
you can't hear clearly

2259
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
There are... all samples

2260
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
you can't hear clearly

2261
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
please sing

2262
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
This is singing you can't hear clearly

2263
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Hong Kong Ice 13 Fanxian

2264
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,420
come aton

2265
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:36,780
imme

2266
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,880
bottom cooper

2267
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,880
Vin

2268
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,180
woke up

2269
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:45,180
yes

2270
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:46,180
sucked

2271
01:44:46,180 --> 01:44:47,260
really

2272
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:48,380
lyrics

2273
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,080
Halloween

2274
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:53,260
Vocaloid

2275
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,760
thank you

2276
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,700
2

2277
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Japanese women should sound like this

2278
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
They are called Bai Dali

2279
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
have arrived at a non-ordinary

2280
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
The deceased passed through the heart individual such

2281
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Don't worship Dali

2282
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
This is the religion

2283
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Foreigners must teach at least one lap

2284
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
This is Bai Dali

2285
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
It's all their own invention

2286
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Japanese

2287
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
If you only go to Japan

2288
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
that god

2289
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
their religion

2290
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
definitely not this

2291
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
hard

2292
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Only he has this voice

2293
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
That pace is their own invention

2294
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Then there is no Shintoism in Japan

2295
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
There are two big benevolent hearts ahead

2296
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
That is our so-so Mazu, that so-and-so

2297
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
world to use

2298
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
So this is the rationale for Taiwan and Japan

2299
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Come on guys we see flags all around

2300
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:19,000
oh where do i press

2301
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:28,000
good

2302
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
good

2303
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
As far as my early economic

2304
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
while marching here

2305
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Talk here and eat

2306
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
pre-economic

2307
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
ok let's hurry back and get this

2308
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
because of today's time

2309
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I would like to introduce a Shulan Town later.

2310
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
It also originated from this place

2311
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
there is no time

2312
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
This is also a solid proof of the adaptation of Japanese songs

2313
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:12,000
ok, but this should show you guys

2314
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:21,500
This is a simple performance in the process of going around

2315
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
well , this is their religion

2316
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,500
What about the religion?

2317
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Let it go...what the hell is it?

2318
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:37,500
They have set up new Zhongshan since 1954

2319
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:42,500
This time in 2008, I went to shoot in New Zhongshan

2320
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,500
In the old days of Japan, the god Amaterasu was placed in the Shinto religion of Japan

2321
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:48,500
or the emperor

2322
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:52,500
He said that it has been changed now, and of course Japanese gods can no longer be displayed

2323
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,500
Well, what god can represent China?

2324
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:00,500
For the sake of political correctness, it is very clear to place the new Zhongshan

2325
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,340
I just saw that there is one in the top god religion

2326
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:10,180
that

2327
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:12,840
that

2328
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,340
Fascinated by evil Buddha

2329
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:15,840
They released Sun Yat-sen

2330
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,840
Sun Yat-sen has been released until now

2331
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,840
Because the one who founded the group said

2332
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,840
Let's think about who is the greatest in China

2333
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:24,840
The Republic of China at that time

2334
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:26,840
Just changed to the Republic of China

2335
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:28,840
After much deliberation, only the father of the country, Sun Yat-sen,

2336
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:32,840
So put the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in

2337
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:33,840
This is

2338
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,840
from another place

2339
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:37,840
This Yu Yutuan later came from Wanli

2340
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,840
Go this way and spread out around here

2341
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:41,840
Several villages have this organization

2342
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,840
It's all taught by the original

2343
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,840
then Hualien

2344
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:49,840
there is one

2345
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:50,840
Hakka Village

2346
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,840
they learn

2347
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:54,840
So they have a group called Yi Nation

2348
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:56,840
Otherwise it is very simple

2349
01:48:56,840 --> 01:48:57,840
they didn't dance

2350
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,840
That's where I'll be where their inspiration comes from

2351
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,100
Okay, I was going to introduce this Shuran bid certificate

2352
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,400
Because this is only starting in 1966

2353
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,400
Now it is very common outside southern Taiwan

2354
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,400
But they are all professional certificates and insurance

2355
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:17,200
The original evidence is very special.

2356
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:18,400
This is a village Taiwanese costume

2357
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,800
Because it was the last lesson, they changed it again

2358
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,600
I used to wear Japanese clothes

2359
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,900
This is the standard of wearing Japanese clothes

2360
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:26,900
The main program of this is

2361
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,900
He looks like a Japanese certificate head

2362
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:38,900
In fact, his content is talking about the customs of marriage in Taiwan

2363
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:48,900
So there are six and a half years, and there is still a platform for a paddle ride

2364
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:51,900
The most important thing is to have a urinal

2365
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:56,900
In the past, there must be Miaotong in the driving suits that Taiwan paid for.

2366
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:59,900
You have to be of a certain age to know

2367
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Because there were no flush toilets before

2368
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
The bride just got married and you shouldn't wash out in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom

2369
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
so there must be a urinal

2370
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Urine or chamber pot in the room

2371
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
So one of the standard equipment of the dowry is the urine bucket

2372
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
So there's that show in their show

2373
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Then those dowries are all Taiwanese style

2374
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But wearing Japanese clothes and dancing Japanese dances

2375
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I told him a story about a marriage custom in Taiwan

2376
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
So it's another big mix

2377
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
This is the dowry, the previous dowry used this

2378
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:41,000
That means matchmaker

2379
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
This is the matchmaker again

2380
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
This is a sixth grade student

2381
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Then his standard equipment will be followed by two people with five or four knives

2382
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
protect the team

2383
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Those two with five or four knives, you have to perform

2384
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Due to time constraints, I can't show you the video today

2385
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:13,000
The most important thing is that this kind of custom is good for the Japanese people and the Japanese-style formation

2386
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:20,000
It has nothing to do with cultural identity, or democratic identity, or national identity

2387
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Basically, it is an element on the ground, which naturally diffuses and expands as the core

2388
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Therefore, traditional Chinese, Taiwanese and Chinese traditional ghost priests are suitable for carrying one of the most important elements of these Japanese gods

2389
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Not because of the uniqueness of these Japanese gods

2390
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
This Japanese-style array is actually a living memory

2391
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
For them, this is very lively, very good-looking, and they just want

2392
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Want to but feel that there is a political taboo, so they come up with ways to fight

2393
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Go in with the story of Taiwan, and it is more beautiful with Japanese clothes

2394
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,440
I think it is more beautiful to package Japanese dance to perform

2395
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:07,200
There's a video of this

2396
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:08,280
because of time

2397
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,400
I'm sorry because everyone talked too much today

2398
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,480
so speak too slowly too early

2399
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,640
So there is no way to show you more videos

2400
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:18,000
I think I'll stop here thank you all

2401
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,400
that i think time flies

2402
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:28,200
It's almost two hours and we don't feel tired at all.

2403
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,600
Because Director Xie Wei Wei came

2404
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,760
very lively and interesting

2405
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:37,160
I'll take about the same amount of time, shall we allow three questions?

2406
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:41,600
It's good if you have time

2407
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,880
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2408
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,640
I want to turn around and ask

2409
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:47,160
That is to say, the teacher told us at the beginning

2410
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,040
Faith tomorrow he has no scriptures

2411
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:51,160
He also has no institutionalized ritual

2412
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:54,720
However, the scriptures of early Buddhism were all passed down orally.

2413
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:57,800
The teacher's speech today also runs through the concept of ghosts and gods

2414
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:00,040
Can't this be a word of mouth?

2415
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
if so

2416
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So our folk beliefs can also be regarded as a kind of

2417
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
something systematic

2418
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
He can't do anything about these rumors

2419
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
write it as a systematic document

2420
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
can't be called classic

2421
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
basically the same

2422
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
is there any other

2423
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
I just want to ask

2424
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
guide if you can

2425
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I want to say can you

2426
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Because in Japanese memory

2427
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
In fact, there are many elements in our post-ten years period

2428
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Today's focus is on religion

2429
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
but i'm facing the person

2430
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
For example, the corporate culture of the Tainan Gang

2431
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Or the part of the business operation

2432
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Or in our language Taiwanese

2433
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
In fact, there are many Japanese elements in it

2434
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I don't know about this part

2435
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Let Yunyue help us introduce

2436
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Thanks

2437
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Parliament bar

2438
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
i think i'm in your consciousness

2439
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
this range is too big

2440
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
some not necessarily in japan

2441
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Actually we thought

2442
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
There are many Japanese in Taiwanese

2443
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
foreign language

2444
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Many Japanese are borrowed from the West

2445
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Fake fat here

2446
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
we don't say fake bread

2447
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
eat bread you fake fat

2448
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
It turns out that fat is Japanese

2449
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Actually fat is not Japanese

2450
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Fat is Spanish or French

2451
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
called fat

2452
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
so it is

2453
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
There are several layers

2454
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
In fact, Taiwan has many

2455
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Gay Taiwan from Holland

2456
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
There are traces left to this day

2457
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
only chance

2458
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
We can all come and explore slowly

2459
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Features of Taiwanese Culture

2460
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
It's good to go through such a different regime

2461
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
signals of different cultures

2462
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
none of them are completely gone

2463
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
and we'll get through

2464
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And will produce the last Taiwan

2465
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Stomach stuff

2466
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,500
only a few simple

2467
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:03,500
South of Taiwan to South of Taiwan

2468
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,700
You can find a lot of iron scissors now

2469
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:08,700
Iron scissors will appear on the wall

2470
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,500
that is a construction of a building

2471
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:17,500
If you go to Europe, Northern Europe, Central Europe, Northern Europe to see

2472
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:21,500
Houses from the 15th and 16th centuries have this on them

2473
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:25,000
Because it's just wood and iron pieces go in

2474
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
extended outside fixed

2475
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
It has various tricks that you will see abroad

2476
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But no one has ever made scissors

2477
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Make it into scissors in Taiwan

2478
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
attached to the wall

2479
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Why because scissors are part of Taiwan's national religion

2480
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Fart oblique is a very important magic weapon

2481
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
so it's called a feast

2482
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
It's what the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference suppressed.

2483
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Combining with the needs of western architectural construction

2484
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Plus the needs of Taiwanese folk beliefs

2485
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
These two are very well combined

2486
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
in Tainan

2487
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,660
The nearest one, you can go out to the train station and there is a Xihuatang in front of you

2488
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,040
a catastrophe church

2489
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,840
there is that temple

2490
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,840
can see these things

2491
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,340
This is the technology left by the Dutch

2492
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:14,840
this one in Taiwan

2493
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:17,340
The influence of this foreign culture is actually very diverse.

2494
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:19,340
That's why Taiwan's multiculturalism is formed

2495
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:21,340
This is one of the characteristics of Taiwanese culture

2496
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:25,840
We also allow the last question

2497
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,000
That Taiwanese God Song

2498
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
that song by that mazdi

2499
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
the one that can be written

2500
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
permission can be provided to us

2501
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
good

2502
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
good internet

2503
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I just had that on it

2504
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
if you need you keep that

2505
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
information to me

2506
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
proof of contact

2507
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
It’s no problem to pass on the information to me and you.

2508
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I provide a photo to tell you

2509
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
that that

2510
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,100
Deep natural feel wind smooth wind mildew giant jaw

2511
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:05,520
The teacher said that two-day students

2512
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,720
Now there is a third one, you can go and have a look

2513
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,500
good

2514
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:11,640
you actually use

2515
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,040
there might be that pop

2516
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:17,040
But the last one was mainly for sightseeing

2517
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:18,000
I know

2518
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:21,840
I think the one in Gaosi Village actually has the purpose of sightseeing

2519
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:28,240
because it's late again

2520
01:57:28,280 --> 01:57:30,240
we thank you again thank you sir

2521
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,440
brilliant speech

2522
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:34,040
Thank you all

2523
01:57:35,240 --> 01:57:37,240
Thank you for participating

2524
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:38,240
thank you all
