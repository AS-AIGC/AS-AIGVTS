00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
===

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Music playing

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Central Research Institute, October's intellectual lecture, the lecture will begin.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's welcome Wang Yu-Yi, vice president of the committee.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Applause

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Good evening, everyone.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We are very happy to welcome you.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,340
The director of our Institute of Chemistry is also a researcher

9
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,840
Director Chen Yuru

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,440
Then Chen Yuru was in 1992

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,240
very young

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,440
Graduated from the Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University in 1992

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,040
Then I got a Ph.D. in Iowa State in 1997

14
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,080
Then go back... worked as a Poster in AMS for a year

15
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,480
Then I went back to Tsinghua University and worked as a Poster for a year

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,520
to Academia Sinica

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,680
So the Academia Sinica has been here since 1999

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,920
Then in 2013 he took over as the director of the Institute of Chemistry

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,600
It is also in our Academia Sinica

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,520
This few very young

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,360
Possibly the youngest director

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,080
also one of the records

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,040
Today I see everyone...

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,400
So excited, there are some high school or junior high school students present

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,780
This topic is obviously very attractive

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,840
he is protein

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,880
Protonax

28
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,660
this protein body

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,260
in the last 10 years 20 years

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,880
It's a very, very popular subject.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,160
this

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,980
Academia Sinica is also good or

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,540
various universities

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,120
A lot of effort has been spent on this

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,420
Chenbai City in

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,700
is used

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,280
Probably he will mention it later in his speech

38
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,080
He uses height

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,620
highly sensitive

40
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Phytograph

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,720
Come

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,760
do this

43
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,320
Be firm and wait

44
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,160
that app is personalizing

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,660
Ling Chuang Proteomics

46
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,460
that hope is practical

47
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,960
We can detect diseases early and

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,260
That is to say, what it actually does

49
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,460
from basic chemistry

50
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,260
from the lowest molecular

51
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,700
to understand the causes of disease

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,960
In the end we hope to be able to

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
reach individual therapy and more

54
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,220
So I guess this is also

55
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,220
where so many people are interested

56
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,720
So its research actually

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,220
Across chemical biochemical materials, etc.

58
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,220
is rare

59
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,220
We say across many, many fields

60
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,220
and so today it is again

61
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,220
in the general public

62
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,980
It should also be possible to understand what it is doing

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,800
So he's not just in his own

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,000
In Taiwan, apart from our own people,

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Of course, what I just said is responsible for some administrative work.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and some academic service work

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
For example, learn, etc.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
These must also cover some international organizations

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So he is also very active internationally

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Of course it will take a lot of time

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So we have to stand with him for another two hours today

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will stop talking nonsense

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let Dr. Chen start his speech

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Colleagues in the hospital

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hello, everyone outside the hospital.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
First of all, I would like to thank Vice President Wang for his introduction.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Actually today I

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
very very nervous today

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I've actually been making slideshows for the past few days

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Because I actually gave a lot of speeches outside in the past

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But most of them are aimed at people in the field of science

82
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
At most, it may be aimed at primary school students, middle school students and college students

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and high school students

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But when I received this invitation

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
They told me that they hope to be able to help the general public

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that the general public can

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Even people who don't understand our science or biology

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
can make them understand

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a big, big challenge for me

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So I actually spent a lot of thinking these days

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's just a lot of thinking

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How can I put this very new theme

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
able to communicate

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
then i think i will try my best

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And let me declare

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I am in the chemistry department of National Taiwan University this afternoon

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been in class for three hours

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So wait a minute in case the throat breaks

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Please include more

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you have a question, you are welcome to raise your hand anytime

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
then i miss everyone

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
when thinking about the average person's perception of protein

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
what is the idea

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Then I did a little test

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I just type protein into that Google

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then check the picture

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I found out a lot of food

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not a test

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
nor treatment

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
all food

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What high protein, low protein

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
good protein bad protein

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So if we take this angle

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm also starting to think

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Why the World Health Organization

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
List this protein as the main nutrient for humans

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't know if you have thought about this problem

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Eating nutrition does not mean

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can transform it right away

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that for protein

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Actually this is a

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
very important source of human health

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
because we ate these foods

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This protein is broken down into amino acids

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Amino acids are a

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the most important ingredient

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
why

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
they will make protein

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then our human body has so many vital functions

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Can eat and drink Lassa, can think, can do many, many things

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In fact, there is a lot of protein to do all kinds of things

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
including the structure of your body

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
why can i move my hands

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
then includes substance delivery

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
then include your metabolism

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You can even think, message transfer, immune regulation, etc.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
These are all proteins to do the job

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But if we look at this biological

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
a so-called one most central criterion

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We know that the most primitive is from DNA

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This molecule starts

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
that DNA it will turn into RNA

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
RNA is turning into protein

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
that in this deep protein process

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It is actually a very complicated process

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
in the process

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There are many factors that make protein expression

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
let me explain

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The so-called performance refers to the

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Concentration meaning

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
its concentration will change

152
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,200
But in the protein factory

153
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,000
in the process of being manufactured

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It will also have a so-called post-repression modification

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,500
It might add, for example in this example

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
under the action of some enzymes

157
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,800
protein will be added with some chemical

158
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
light energy machine

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,500
For example, this is a

160
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
a chemical molecule of pro-acid

161
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,000
After adding these light energy machines

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's as if these proteins are spliced

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
so-called antenna

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,500
It will be identified by many, many actions

165
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Then we can't help but ask a question

166
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Among so many biomolecules

167
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
who is the most important thing

168
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
who is primarily to perform the function of the organism

169
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Is it DNA?

170
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Is it RNA or protein?

171
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
I don't announce the answer

172
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
please think about it

173
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Let's start with an interesting question

174
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
i like reading philosophy

175
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,000
I have read many theories

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
what is human existence

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
is the physical existence

178
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,120
or are you in fact just everything invisible

179
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
just you see this guy

180
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
Just an image of your brainwaves

181
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
So the biologists

182
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,040
What they must believe is the so-called

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
Balvin's theory of evolution

184
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
This is the person from this

185
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,640
Slowly evolve from the source

186
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
But if you are religious

187
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,720
you may feel god

188
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,200
He is the biggest commander

189
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,520
God created everything

190
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
create everything

191
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,120
I also read science books

192
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,920
He said that some people think that in fact many

193
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
Our physical existence is a TV wave

194
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,000
There's just one brain center to direct

195
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,520
so we're going to answer

196
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
who am i

197
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,880
the simplest

198
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
What we learned from textbooks

199
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,640
Everyone agrees

200
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,200
The origin of life is from DNA

201
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,400
DNA is actually a very mysterious combination

202
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,280
It only has four monomer ATGCs in total

203
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,640
But these four monomers

204
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,240
will become tangled into very

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
a very long molecule

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Then in order to solve this problem

207
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,600
In fact, in the past ten or twenty years

208
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,400
There's a very, very important scientific advance

209
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
then let me introduce to you

210
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
If we look at the composition of a person

211
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
we know everyone

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,400
you have about six trillion cells

213
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,000
Each person has twenty-three pairs of chromosomes

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Twenty-two pairs of normal chromosomes

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,400
The other pair are the so-called sex chromosomes

216
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,000
Then your chromosomes usually come from your mother

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
usually from your dad

218
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,800
But have you ever thought about a question

219
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,400
if this your chromosome

220
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
All from Mom and Dad

221
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,800
Why Siblings Are So Different

222
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,400
regardless of intelligence

223
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
regardless of your appearance

224
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,800
In fact, many brothers and sisters are not alike at all.

225
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Then in order to understand this problem

226
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,400
around 1988

227
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Please go back to that long time ago in history

228
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,400
At that time it didn't matter

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,300
There is this concept of computer

230
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,540
Then in the 1980s

231
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,140
Gene sequencing work begins

232
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,800
So, some people started to think

233
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,900
Now that I can sequence the genes

234
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,100
i will explain later

235
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,040
Then can we put human

236
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,640
This complex genome solves it all

237
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
The idea of ​​Echo

238
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,640
is a department called the U.S. Department of Energy

239
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,140
The U.S. Department of Energy is a

240
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,900
very very rich research unit

241
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,300
Okay, when you think about energy, it means oil.

242
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,800
they are early

243
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,540
they are doing a lot of drilling for oil

244
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,100
so they will prop up a lot

245
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,860
so-called interesting project

246
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,440
Even a plan that everyone thinks is impossible

247
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,640
as long as it's interesting they'll go to the props

248
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
So in 1988 when

249
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,140
DOE

250
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,560
that combines in the United States for this biomedical field

251
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,100
a very important research institution

252
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,440
National Institutes of Health

253
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,700
their two units

254
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,400
First started with such an idea

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,320
Can we take two or three pairs of human chromosomes

256
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,120
corresponding to this gene

257
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,160
can you solve it all

258
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,000
Of course everyone thought it was an impossible task at the time.

259
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,540
no one thought it would work

260
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,620
Then this Selera company

261
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,180
It's a private biotech company

262
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,040
Then they later showed the possibility of commercial interests

263
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,600
So in 1997 they

264
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,140
joined the program

265
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,460
I didn't expect that in the process

266
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,340
Everyone can finally solve this problem with gene sequencing

267
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,940
Then let me explain a little bit here. This is actually a very interesting method.

268
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,500
This genetic sequencing is called the submachine gun method.

269
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,300
Sharkoon is that submachine gun

270
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,580
Submachine guns in the movie

271
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,420
Then his methodology is actually relying on some coal

272
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,200
This coal is also a protein

273
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,760
That coal is like a submachine gun

274
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,060
He only sees only DNA

275
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,540
he cut it up

276
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,840
So why is he called submachine gun method

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
that in the process of chopping and chopping

278
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
i just mentioned

279
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,800
The era sequenced

280
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,760
This methodology for gene sequencing just came out

281
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,760
so what

282
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,360
As long as we can get this

283
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,560
The sequence of each small fragment solves it

284
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,360
it has many many many paragraphs

285
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,960
OK, after I solve it

286
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,520
I then find out which fragments are overlapping

287
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,000
or if the same

288
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,360
There should be a part of the sequence that should be repeated

289
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,760
So you by this example

290
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,000
you can see this paragraph

291
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,120
There are 4 ACGAs here

292
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,600
It is the same as the following ACGA4

293
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,080
So it is possible that this paragraph will be connected with this paragraph.

294
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,600
In the same way, I can put the same

295
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
I'll pick it up again

296
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,360
So using these three paragraphs

297
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,760
I can piece together a long paragraph

298
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,040
by analogy

299
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,760
You can push it piece by piece

300
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,200
finally hook it up

301
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,760
ok but i want to stress

302
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,760
this is a very long sequence

303
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,960
Okay, so here's a lot of multigene sequencing

304
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,360
Biological information beyond tools

305
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
computer information

306
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,100
In fact, it is a very important one in this project.

307
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,400
a component

308
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,900
So bioinformatics was also at that time

309
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,400
Start a lot of this derivative

310
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,300
Didn't think it was about 15 years

311
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,900
We actually sequenced the human genome

312
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,100
After that, of course, one after another

313
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,400
Some other countries have joined

314
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,300
So later everyone found out that

315
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,100
People are so complicated, everyone is different

316
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,400
In fact, he doesn't have that many genes.

317
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,600
About 30,000 functional copies of this gene

318
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,200
Then after the gene sequencing is completed

319
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,600
Many upgrade companies have been produced one after another

320
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Chip company Gene testing company

321
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
everyone thinks

322
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,400
After this periodic table

323
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,700
I personally think

324
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,200
This is probably the most important thing in the history of human science

325
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,600
We've solved the genetic jigsaw puzzle

326
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,400
So everyone thinks that after having this gene

327
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,500
Because the gene produces RNA to produce Portin

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
After this blueprint we should all things

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,700
all problems can be solved

330
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,400
all the secrets we should be able to know

331
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,700
why is there life why is there disease

332
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,700
But is it true?

333
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,300
Then after the genetic sequencing of this human

334
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,300
A new field has emerged called genomics

335
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,400
Well, the gene is a segment

336
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
This is called gene

337
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,000
Genome means

338
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,300
I'm going to study all the genes, this is called the gene body

339
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm going to learn about all the structures

340
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,300
I'm going to find out what it does

341
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
This is called genomics

342
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,900
Here are some students here to explain

343
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,700
A gene means a single

344
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,300
Then if you see this OME, it means all the components

345
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,700
This is called GENOME

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,500
Then add ICS to represent the knowledge of what to study

347
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,900
So you'll hear a lot of GENOMICS

348
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,700
POTENOMICS METAPOLOMICS

349
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,400
What do they represent?

350
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,500
There is even a company in Taiwan called

351
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,900
Physical science companies are studying these

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,740
Then after the genetic sequencing of this human

353
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,900
One after another there are many important

354
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,980
The species sequencing of this animal was also done

355
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,240
then you may feel

356
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,740
why not our cutest puppy

357
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,500
cats because they are not animal models

358
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,700
Then you can see things like worms, mice, etc.

359
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,140
These are zebrafish

360
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,900
These are very important for biomedical research

361
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,500
an animal pattern

362
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,540
So these are sequenced

363
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:35,140
In the process, a very interesting question arises

364
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,500
In theory this could be one of the most important discoveries in human history

365
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,500
we make money from it

366
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,300
And this guy Gray Venter

367
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,100
is what I just mentioned

368
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,140
The president of this company at Stellera

369
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,940
then why did he join

370
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,900
because he finds it profitable

371
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,100
So then he brought up

372
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,740
should go to the result of this sequence

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,040
apply for patent

374
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,200
Everyone who wants to use it has to pay

375
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,800
That is to believe that he lost

376
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,600
Because everyone thinks that human genes

377
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,200
belongs to all

378
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,000
It should not be used for commercial interests

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,600
So he lost

380
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,800
he lost to him

381
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,600
Everyone thinks it should be shared

382
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,800
so the same human protein

383
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
Once completed in the future

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,400
also belong to all mankind

385
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,600
Everyone in our field feels that

386
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,000
This should belong to all mankind

387
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
a blessing of

388
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
but at the same time

389
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,800
He also did a very interesting thing

390
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,600
Then in 2000 when he

391
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,000
publishes his own personal sequence

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
then why did i bring it up

393
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,200
Because after about seven or eight years of this process

394
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,400
In fact, the tools for gene sequencing are becoming more and more mature.

395
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,800
so you can imagine

396
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
I personally at least believe

397
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,200
one day

398
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
You may want to see if there is anything wrong with your body

399
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
you originally had a gene

400
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
may be able to tell you

401
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,680
The state of your body now

402
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
So this is a very important development

403
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,720
But after gene sequencing is complete

404
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
do we solve all the problems

405
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,600
I would like to introduce two important people here

406
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,760
an important person black star our ten group

407
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,840
I don't need to introduce

408
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,120
there is another

409
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,560
This is my college classmate

410
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,160
Researcher Lin Zhiming

411
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,600
He is now at the Fate Institute of Academia Sinica

412
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
He is a disciple of Dean Li Yuanzhe

413
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,040
he is super

414
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
He is doing this in the atmosphere

415
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,960
This environment-related molecule

416
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,760
so he is my idol

417
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,760
My classmates have been great since before

418
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,640
Excuse me

419
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,880
How similar are these two people

420
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,720
don't be afraid

421
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,560
I asked Lin Zhiming for permission

422
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,600
so don't be afraid

423
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,720
Lin Zhiming agreed

424
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,200
he heard this too

425
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,160
I did this

426
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,040
Because he first asked me to teach high school students

427
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
I said can I be kidding

428
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
say no problem

429
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,020
He's so smart that the black star

430
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,820
I think Lin Zhiming is at least much handsomer than him

431
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,020
Does anyone want to take a guess please ask you

432
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,420
How similar are their genes

433
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,380
99.5

434
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,660
Then I believe that many people here must have studied statistics.

435
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,460
Is there any student or person who can tell me

436
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,940
In the case of statistically two standard deviations

437
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,420
What is the percentage of similarity between two objects

438
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,580
We call these two things the same

439
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,780
Can anyone tell me that students should be able to

440
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,140
More than 90

441
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
how many 90

442
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,020
My students can't answer

443
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,780
i say it again

444
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,420
That is to say, statistically we often say

445
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,380
With a probability of 95.5 percent

446
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,620
We call these two things the same

447
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,260
So in statistics, 95.5 is the same as we think

448
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,360
So if from this point of view

449
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,400
the answer is 98

450
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,400
So from a practical point of view

451
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,000
98% of human DNA is exactly the same as stars

452
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,000
Then if you talk about statistics

453
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,300
they are the same

454
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
But you know it's totally different

455
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
the next question

456
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,900
if the same person

457
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,600
How similar is this gene

458
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,400
let me explain

459
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,200
This is the most handsome man in the world in my opinion

460
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,300
And this is the smartest in the world I think

461
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,500
I adore him so much

462
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,700
so he is my alien

463
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,900
I also believe

464
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,000
Of course Lin Zhiming is still very good

465
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,300
How similar are these three people?

466
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,500
We just said that people are 98 times worse than stars

467
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,400
How different are the three

468
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,000
just that answer

469
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
99.9

470
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,100
So here comes an interesting question:

471
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
the three of them totally

472
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
not related to

473
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
but their genes

474
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
Up to 99.9% similarity

475
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So if you and your brothers and sisters

476
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
you can imagine

477
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You feel more similar

478
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But why are people so different

479
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
good

480
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Here I list

481
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
several fragments of genes

482
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
one of them

483
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
one of them is

484
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The Genes of the Mediterranean Type

485
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know everyone's eyes

486
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Can you see the difference?

487
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
one of them is

488
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
mediterranean critique

489
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
different from others

490
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
here

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
good

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so everyone can see

493
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
at this place

494
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
this place is different

495
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
good

496
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
so say

497
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
genetically similar

498
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
but why

499
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
a defect in a gene or two

500
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
on the contrary, it will make a big difference

501
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
mediterranean typology

502
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Then I'll give another one

503
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
more extreme example

504
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
we know say

505
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
My biology is not good

506
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But we know that butterflies have

507
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,440
From passing through the egg, no, it should be the egg, right?

508
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,040
egg, from brave to heavy

509
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,440
it has undergone such a transformation

510
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,940
But if you look at its genome,

511
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,880
The genome of these four periods is completely unchanged

512
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,040
are exactly the same

513
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,940
So there seems to be some problem here

514
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,840
we are not able to answer

515
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,440
it goes through if all the same

516
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,600
why is it so different

517
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,800
No matter its shape, no matter its whole state

518
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,440
is completely different

519
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,880
So in the process

520
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,280
let me explain

521
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,080
We know that DNA turns into RNA

522
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,880
that makes protein from RNA

523
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,080
That's because each DNA transfer process to RNA

524
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,580
It each this password is fixed

525
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,480
ATGC must be the same for everyone

526
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,180
So theoretically once the DNA is fixed,

527
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,880
It produces proteins that are also immobilized

528
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,420
Because every RNA code

529
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,920
will produce the same amino acid

530
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
That's why

531
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Just for this example

532
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Why did the DNA sequence change after

533
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
mediterranean selection

534
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The reason is that

535
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
When this gene is mutated

536
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
For example, this is a normal gene

537
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Then these two produce

538
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
should produce this amino acid

539
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But what happens when your genetic mutation

540
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It starts from this amino acid

541
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
into this amino acid of Valorin

542
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
This position happens to be the protein

543
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This hemoglobin is combined with oxygen

544
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
it's in our blood

545
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
is responsible for carrying oxygen

546
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This location happens to be

547
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The position where this protein binds to the oxygen species

548
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
In other words, the point

549
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
because the structure of the protein has changed

550
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
So it produces Mediterranean type selection

551
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So from this example tell us that

552
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Actually the protein it is really going to perform

553
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
An important function of a molecule

554
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
genes are stable

555
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
protein is the active

556
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
to help you perform functions

557
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So after genomics

558
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
A new field has emerged

559
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
protein body

560
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I think I probably know all about protein.

561
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
that proteosome

562
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
means all protein

563
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This is called protein body

564
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
what about this concept

565
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
it was 1994

566
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
by this from Australia

567
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Professor Marco Wilken

568
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
first proposed

569
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But I'm here to tell you

570
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
when he brought it up

571
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's his first year of doctoral class

572
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
the age of his students

573
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So he still looks like this

574
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
This is his current photo

575
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
He's younger than me at the right age

576
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The appearance of this proteosome

577
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
In fact, he wants to respond

578
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
we want to understand

579
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
These are the ones that actually perform the function

580
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
these proteins

581
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
we want to analyze him

582
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So we gave him a

583
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
protein body

584
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So we want to understand

585
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
all protein

586
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
That field is analyzing

587
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
or what are you looking at

588
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
for example

589
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,800
We want to understand the different states

590
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,200
Behavior of the protein Has its concentration changed?

591
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,000
Especially cancer, which we'll get to later.

592
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,600
Many cancers are caused by protein concentration

593
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,300
abnormal increase

594
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,200
or after generation

595
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Post-repression modification of this protein

596
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
Did it add some special light energy machine

597
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
Like Linghua or like Zhongyuanyuan

598
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
a very important area

599
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Glycosylation Glycosylation

600
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,900
Added some specific sugar molecules

601
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,700
The entire protein structure and its function are all changed.

602
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,900
even protein measurements

603
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,300
It is the structure of three degrees and four degrees

604
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,500
And protein is actually very similar to people

605
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,800
According to the research in the project play

606
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,100
70% of protein is with other people

607
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,300
it doesn't exist alone

608
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,700
like human society

609
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,000
Then it likes three to five friends best

610
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,500
So in East

611
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,200
About three to five proteins are aggregated together

612
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,600
So this is also a very interesting thing

613
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,200
its not a singles

614
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,800
it's actually a group

615
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,000
Let's do something together

616
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,660
Let's give an example

617
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,460
with this history

618
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,360
If you go for a cancer test today

619
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,560
Is it DNA?

620
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,920
mostly protein

621
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,960
This is where you go to the hospital

622
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,560
during this cancer screening

623
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,560
a some protein

624
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,960
have some protein

625
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,560
it has high professionalism

626
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,320
For example, this liver cancer

627
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,280
Not recommended

628
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,040
This is an embryonic protein

629
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,040
when your concentration

630
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,480
this egg white is interesting

631
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,200
its when a woman is pregnant

632
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,320
when the fetus

633
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,680
This concentration is very high

634
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,880
After birth, however, the concentration decreases

635
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,520
But when this protein concentration

636
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Just be careful when raising

637
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,320
You are at risk for cancer

638
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,720
another prostate cancer

639
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,360
There are also relatively specialized proteins

640
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,200
There are some so-called screening proteins

641
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,080
This is the number of the protein

642
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,960
that you are in many different

643
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,800
These concentrations are elevated in cancer

644
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,660
So the doctor will tell you that in case of misfortune

645
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,860
Your concentration increases

646
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,460
He'll tell you to watch, screen, etc.

647
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,760
But you can also see from here

648
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,400
still many important cancers

649
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,400
e.g. lung cancer

650
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,600
No detected molecules at all

651
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,460
the other one

652
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,300
just is the detection point of view

653
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,700
from a therapeutic point of view

654
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,560
Protein is also the most important

655
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,160
target molecule

656
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,620
that is outside the sin of the cell

657
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,780
we call the top of the cell membrane

658
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,520
on the cell membrane

659
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,260
There are so many important glycoproteins

660
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Membrane Protein

661
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,620
then they are often

662
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,660
double as this material transport

663
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,880
especially the function of drug delivery

664
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,580
Then they also receive messages from the outside world.

665
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,220
And then also they're doing a lot of molecular

666
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,820
Identify a very important protein

667
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,780
So if you look at this treatment this statistic

668
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,480
Let me explain a little bit here

669
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,840
This is the article

670
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
he went to count

671
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,300
Probably nearly 500 different drugs in clinical practice

672
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,600
Then it counts who these drugs are aimed at.

673
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,600
come do this go be a goal

674
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,800
Then you can see that the DNA is very small

675
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,700
only here

676
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,600
Everything else is protein

677
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
all of them

678
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
So if you're looking at this receptor

679
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,300
It's a receptor for a receiving protein called messaging

680
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,100
Those are all cell membrane proteins

681
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,500
Probably we can say that more than 70% of the drugs

682
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,000
All target membrane proteins of cell membranes

683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The most famous one is GPCR

684
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
receptor protein

685
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
They are widely used in

686
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,300
various diseases

687
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,800
So from the detection point of view

688
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,500
From a Drug Development Perspective

689
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Proteins are very important class of molecules

690
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
that in the process

691
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,800
it actually

692
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,700
But it compares to DNA

693
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,000
It's actually a very complicated process

694
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,500
Then I have a protein with this

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's called EGF

696
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,100
This is currently in lung cancer and breast cancer

697
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,160
target especially lung cancer

698
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,500
Most important most important target protein

699
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,760
So this is a protein structure

700
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,420
This circle represents the protein structure

701
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,920
This place represents the cell membrane

702
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,460
It's a protein stuck in the cell membrane

703
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,200
that's outside the cell membrane

704
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,300
it has a lot of sugar programs

705
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,760
these are sugar

706
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,260
Then everyone already knows, not everyone

707
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,000
This is Dean Wen's discovery

708
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,700
they found out

709
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,300
EGF outside the cell membrane

710
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,960
If there is this Syllation

711
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,760
dehydrated acid sugar

712
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,800
or sugar like Fucose

713
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,360
it will suppress

714
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,460
This EGF

715
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,160
This protein is activated

716
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,360
That's more complicated

717
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,420
outside changed

718
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,660
It actually affects the inside

719
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,360
The P stands for the message transmission of acidification

720
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,200
This is currently the most important mechanism for message delivery

721
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,660
Then they found that once the outside sugar was suppressed

722
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,820
It also causes EGF

723
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The probability that this protein is activated

724
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,160
But what is interesting is our experience

725
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
When Dean Wen told us at that time

726
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,040
I think such an important goal

727
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,360
Should be clear here

728
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,460
in fact not yet

729
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,660
so exaggerated

730
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,660
I think it's exaggerated

731
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,460
Such an important target therapy

732
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,160
But the above structure

733
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,460
The underlying structure is currently unclear

734
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,040
How does it affect the two

735
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,500
Actually still not clear

736
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,660
that in terms of it

737
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,740
Why are these targets

738
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,660
Why These Membrane Proteins Are Important

739
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,660
because once it is stimulated

740
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,320
it initiates what is called messaging

741
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,120
like we're running a relay race

742
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,120
protein one by one

743
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,620
Many times in this race it has to take over

744
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,020
It is through this spiritual acidification

745
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,500
Once acidified by the spirit it knows

746
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,820
I'm coming to take over

747
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,360
those messages

748
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,620
once it happens it's bad

749
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,560
sometimes there are some roads

750
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,000
it causes cell growth

751
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,700
But if cancer cells grow

752
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,900
that would be bad, cause cancer

753
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,820
so how to find out

754
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,500
The process of this message passing

755
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,660
And then to shoot

756
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
New drug to inhibit such a pathway

757
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,400
It's actually a very important point

758
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,160
In terms of acidification

759
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,600
The targeted therapy currently used in hospitals

760
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,400
You can see all these proteins

761
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,320
each of these names is protein

762
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,960
These are all membrane proteins of the cell membrane

763
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,560
Some use small molecules to inhibit it

764
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,600
Some use antibodies to inhibit it

765
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,320
Let me give you an example

766
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,760
For example, the method of liquid drama

767
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,000
this is lung cancer

768
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,760
Lung cancer in the East is very different from lung cancer in the West

769
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
Lung cancer in the East has a characteristic

770
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,520
early-onset lung cancer in women

771
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,880
relatively high

772
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,240
There is another very important feature

773
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,240
It is the liquid drama method that the protein will have a so-called mutation

774
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,920
it will have this mutation

775
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,520
The advantage is that once the method of this liquid drama changes

776
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Add this medicine outside

777
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,680
This TKI is a drug

778
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,960
Now maybe everyone talks about Aretha

779
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,160
everyone will understand

780
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,660
This is a targeted therapy drug for cancer

781
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,700
The advantage is that once there is a mutation

782
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,800
These drugs can inhibit their

783
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,800
so that it doesn't generate this rep suppression

784
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,740
But these patients take medicine

785
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,200
After about six months to a year, unfortunately

786
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,300
Almost always produces a second mutation

787
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,240
The second mutation of this place

788
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,160
Bad once mutated

789
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,200
They eventually develop resistance

790
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,760
So it will recur in the end

791
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Then this is still the oriental lung

792
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,160
an unsolvable problem

793
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,660
There is still no way

794
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,220
So from this point of view

795
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,420
you can understand

796
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,720
protein is a

797
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,920
In fact, it is a very complicated mechanism

798
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,820
Then we have to understand the whole process well.

799
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,120
We can devise new methods and strategies

800
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,760
to understand the process

801
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,220
The most complicated thing is that it is not a single path

802
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,820
It's called all roads lead to Rome

803
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,320
In terms of medical cancer law

804
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,620
this is a cell

805
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,420
It has at least three, four or more

806
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,620
different way

807
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,380
In other words

808
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
Say your cancer is treated today

809
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,800
you stuck this road

810
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,360
Today, the Central Plains Court closed this road

811
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,800
I can also get from Southport

812
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
from another direction

813
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,240
or from that highway

814
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
I go shopping in Sogo

815
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,240
there are so many roads

816
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,800
So how can these systems

817
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,000
able to figure out

818
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I personally think it is very important

819
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,200
Because in traditional protein research

820
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Usually it is to study a Protin

821
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,000
But it's actually a systemic problem

822
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
Then I use this example

823
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,760
It's easier to understand when you explain it to everyone

824
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,320
I'm here

825
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,720
Nakahara Institute expects

826
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,520
Each of us should do a good job in research

827
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,760
well done research

828
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,120
My students, I just take out two of them

829
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
most related to me

830
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,920
In theory, my students should work hard and earnestly.

831
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,520
But is it actually so?

832
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,360
no

833
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,920
because in this study

834
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,320
There are so many tools that I can't have

835
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,960
so i have to rely on others

836
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,960
This is Mr. Song Yifei from the Information Office

837
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,600
ok then this is my friend from japan

838
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,800
Mr. Yixu Hama, Kyoto University

839
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,960
So in fact, I have to do a good job in research

840
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,300
can't just look at them

841
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,960
Then if I want to study lung cancer

842
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,300
I did not visit the pier with Principal Yang Panchi

843
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,200
probably not too good

844
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,660
Because he knows best what lung cancer is

845
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,660
So this is a very important alliance

846
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,160
But if research funding is concerned

847
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,560
This is Dean Wen, everyone should know

848
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,000
Then the deputy king is here

849
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,960
So if I tell this next joke to only

850
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,460
Finally someone understands

851
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,760
just if you're going to ask for money

852
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
No one will ask the dean

853
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,560
Because you want your self-esteem not to suffer

854
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,520
hope you feel better

855
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,900
Usually we go to the smiling person and ask

856
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,760
then vice wang

857
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,600
Then we will ask the dean for money as a last resort.

858
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,800
And of course but so what I'm going to say is

859
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,760
This is just a working network

860
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,400
In other words, if you are going to ask today

861
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,000
Can Chen Yuru do research well at Academia Sinica?

862
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,760
It's not my problem

863
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,360
It is a very complex network problem

864
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,320
If you want to ask today

865
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,920
I will give another simple example

866
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,120
For example, let's say we're getting married

867
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,240
Then you have a girlfriend, boyfriend

868
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
you have to predict

869
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,680
you marry him in the future

870
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,000
Will you be happy

871
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,840
you absolutely need to know his family

872
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,640
right

873
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,880
For example, you want to know your mother-in-law

874
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,240
Will it be difficult to get along with?

875
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,440
So this is a

876
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,240
complex network problem

877
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,640
OK, so we think protein

878
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,680
with proteosomes

879
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
In fact, only through the proteosome

880
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,640
In order to be able to understand more systematically

881
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,400
what happened to us

882
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
at the molecular level

883
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,280
The first big obstacle is

884
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,280
The protein body is so complex

885
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
what tools are we going to use for research

886
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,280
Let's start with the simplest species

887
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,880
Even a simple E. coli

888
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,880
it has thousands of proteins

889
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,200
Then we estimate human

890
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,480
There are at least 35,000 different

891
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,000
different protein

892
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,440
What tool can be used to do this

893
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,800
So how do we identify proteins

894
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,200
that identifies proteins in this

895
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,400
what i call identification

896
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,160
I put this definition first

897
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,760
not that i need to know this

898
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,560
i am female

899
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,160
I want the so-called identification is

900
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
you have to tell me

901
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,360
I am Chen Yuru

902
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,000
I am not Wang Qihui

903
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,960
I'm not Vice President Wang Yu, etc.

904
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,160
This is called identification

905
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,400
so as a tool

906
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,800
how to tell you this

907
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,720
The paper spectrometer is here

908
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,320
It's a tool that's over a hundred years old

909
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,960
that from the earliest atoms in our periodic table

910
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,720
wait a minute we'll talk

911
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,680
OK, let's talk about this first

912
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,120
Then this paper spectrometer

913
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
It's actually a stick

914
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,880
It can tell your analyte

915
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,560
How much does it weigh

916
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,360
Its concept is actually very simple

917
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,720
Its concept is

918
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,800
When we charge the analyte

919
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,720
under the action of a power plant or a magnetic field

920
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,640
the time it arrived at the detector

921
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,680
Or the path will be different

922
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,440
So we can use this way

923
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,880
to measure the quality

924
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,640
the size of this

925
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,000
it's complicated

926
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,440
i guess i won't explain

927
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,240
It's a very complex instrument

928
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,400
In fact, everyone is very concerned about Zhi Puyi

929
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,640
It shouldn't feel too strange

930
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,480
Because the first periodic table

931
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,200
is the first

932
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,960
For the first element of the periodic table

933
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,680
It is measured from the concept of fat

934
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,280
If you still remember this JJ Thompson

935
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,440
He was the first to discover that

936
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,880
in this power plant

937
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,320
We'll see a so-called charged one

938
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,720
a radiation

939
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,840
In fact, it is a lipo

940
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,040
So this is the earliest and earliest Zhipu

941
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,720
You can see this atom of Niang

942
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,200
it has two parity digits

943
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
20 and 22

944
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,160
because its weight is different

945
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,640
So it's under this action of this magnetic field

946
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,920
it deflects

947
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,080
This is a lipo

948
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,160
So using this simple concept

949
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,400
we can build

950
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,120
This human this is probably the human always the ultimate

951
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,240
The most important thing is the periodic table

952
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,840
However, although Zhipu has been

953
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,040
so widely used

954
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
But in the early days

955
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,440
Actually none of us ever knew

956
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
He can do biomolecular analysis

957
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,560
In the development of this whole history, this Zhipu

958
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,040
from the earliest atoms

959
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,800
then to the chemical age

960
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,400
many, many small molecules

961
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,040
until the 1970s

962
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Polymer oil extraction and so on

963
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
carried on until later

964
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
what about later

965
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,240
around 1995

966
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,760
By Mr. Tanaka from Japan

967
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,040
He's an engineer from Xu Ma's company

968
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,400
Then when he was doing an experiment

969
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,680
That era was the age of polymers

970
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,360
So his task is to find a material

971
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,560
Let this polymer be our textile

972
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,760
plastic these

973
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,080
Can be tested with Zhipu

974
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,080
How big is this polymer?

975
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
then he made a mistake once

976
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Accidentally discovered the world's first protein map

977
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Then its method is to use the concept of laser

978
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
To do the identification of this mass spectrum

979
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Then there is another professor John Fenn

980
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
He has always hoped to use high-voltage electricity

981
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
able to make this deepening molecule

982
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
be able to electrify it to be detected

983
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So he's using a method called electrospraying

984
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It's the high voltage that sprays it out

985
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
the two of them

986
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
discovered at almost the same time

987
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
for this protein molecule

988
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
capable of mass spectrometry

989
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So in 2002 when they

990
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

991
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Then this is in this field

992
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
a very important development

993
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Then I'll pick one of the easy ones first.

994
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
explain to everyone

995
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Why can mass spectrometry measure this mass?

996
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
this size

997
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Then what I introduce here is

998
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Mr. Araka's laser mechanism

999
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
laser assist

1000
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Lei Se entrusted oil treatment method

1001
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,200
In fact, it has two important elements

1002
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,160
The first is called organic matter

1003
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,160
This mechanism is some small molecular acids

1004
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,200
It is very easy to generate in this light ion

1005
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,800
This light ion can be transferred to

1006
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,160
Let it be charged on this analytical sample

1007
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,600
The second important element is lace

1008
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,320
The role of this lace is

1009
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,160
When we mix these analytes with the organic

1010
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,120
Because lace has energy

1011
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,800
So when Lei Se went to take this sample

1012
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,080
It will put the organic light ion

1013
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
let it jump out

1014
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
and then separated from the analyte

1015
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,440
so make it electrified

1016
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
when it is electrified

1017
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,560
It actually uses the concept of a race

1018
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,960
to measure its size

1019
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,200
Its principle is actually very simple

1020
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,560
after lace sparks it

1021
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,920
Different molecules will get the same potential energy

1022
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,000
This potential energy is converted into

1023
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,700
It's a race in an electric field, a free one out of five

1024
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,000
Then we know that when the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy

1025
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,700
Because this speed, this V means that speed is inversely proportional to mass

1026
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:18,000
So a fat person has a slower speed, and a thinner person has a faster speed

1027
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,300
So when the two of us go for a run

1028
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,600
fast thin people run fast

1029
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,600
He arrives first and the fat man arrives later

1030
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,100
So take advantage of this different flight time

1031
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,300
We can analyze the different quality

1032
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,000
Then this is a very simple principle of Zhipu

1033
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,500
Then it will be difficult

1034
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,300
Please take this matter seriously

1035
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,800
use weight for this matter

1036
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,100
Why can I tell you the different identities of these three people

1037
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,400
This same one was made by my daughter for me

1038
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,400
I told her I'm looking for three different people

1039
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,600
Then she told me to find these three

1040
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,700
please think about it

1041
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,700
I just mentioned that QP is weighing

1042
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,800
right

1043
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
OK, let's look at the weight

1044
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,160
The lady in the shirt is the thinnest one

1045
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,160
45 kg casually

1046
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,920
Those two people are a little bit fatter

1047
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,200
55 kg

1048
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,960
I just weighed the thing

1049
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,520
can i judge

1050
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,520
His name is Hushan, his name is Mizushima, his name is Triangle

1051
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,200
Everyone thinks no, right?

1052
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,400
Then please think again

1053
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,600
can you think or tell me

1054
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,360
I can only give you a stick scale

1055
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,120
How you can use stick scales

1056
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,360
separate the two

1057
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
Think again, everyone, the concept of weighing

1058
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,080
anyone figured it out

1059
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,920
In fact, the reason is very simple

1060
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,560
Everyone's body proportions are different

1061
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,720
For example, Mrs. Mizushima has a super big head

1062
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,280
that her legs are a little bit

1063
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
also short

1064
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,000
then Mrs. Triangle

1065
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,960
her head is bigger

1066
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,160
But look carefully at her hands and feet

1067
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,260
Actually a little thinner

1068
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,460
if you look carefully

1069
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,660
So if I cut them up

1070
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,620
If it is divided into four limbs and disassembled completely

1071
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,000
The proportion of their body

1072
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,260
the weight of her hands her head her feet

1073
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,660
It's actually different

1074
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,460
So if each of you looks very different

1075
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,620
I can make this limb very precise

1076
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,740
words of weight

1077
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,240
Then I can actually learn from this so-called combination

1078
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,280
To judge that this is water pouring

1079
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,920
this is a triangle

1080
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,780
So you use the concept

1081
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,240
You can actually do protein analysis

1082
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,240
purely by weight

1083
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,320
Then I will use this concept to explain to you

1084
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,240
Why weighing can start from weighing

1085
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,740
to tell you what this protein is

1086
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:58,620
Well, this technique is called protein identification.

1087
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,080
then we know

1088
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
This protein is made up of 20 common amino acid arrangements

1089
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Each amino acid is different because of its structure

1090
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
so its weight is completely different

1091
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Then I'm going to measure a protein weight today

1092
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
If I measure the whole weight, it will be the same as the problem just now

1093
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
same weight too much

1094
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
45 kg is too many people

1095
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
55 kg is too many people

1096
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I can't really tell who's who.

1097
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
But if I cut this protein into pieces

1098
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Then this cut is of course a regular cut

1099
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
At this time, after the protein is cut into fragments

1100
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
because every fragment

1101
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Because this sequence of every protein and amino acid

1102
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
is unique

1103
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Everyone's sequence is different

1104
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
so when i cut

1105
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
cut out fragments of this ecology

1106
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Its sequence is also unique

1107
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That's because each amino acid has a different weight

1108
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So this time I can go and put this weight

1109
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Test this separately

1110
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
side out

1111
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Then if the sequence composition of this protein is different

1112
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The weight of the fragment it produces

1113
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Must be a unique set

1114
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
like a fingerprint

1115
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
everyone is different

1116
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So using the concept

1117
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I can do the comparison

1118
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So in this methodology

1119
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
We can start with some enzymes

1120
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
chop protein into pieces

1121
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that in this example

1122
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It uses an enzyme called Tripsing

1123
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
These enzymes must be very specific

1124
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
it will recognize

1125
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
specific amino acids it will cut

1126
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
so it encounters this red

1127
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
it's just

1128
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
after you cut

1129
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Because the order of the proteins is different

1130
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So you can think of it as saying

1131
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
each protein has its own

1132
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
A very unique set of Peptide pieces

1133
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
At this time, I will use the mass spectrometer to weigh

1134
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I'm going to test it

1135
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
The weight of this fragment

1136
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
what are they

1137
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So I am at this time

1138
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You can put this Peptide

1139
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
this pile of debris

1140
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
To measure mass spectrometry

1141
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Then this mass spectrum is a snack

1142
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That means mass means weight

1143
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So this goes from 600 weight to 3000

1144
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Each bar represents the weight of each segment

1145
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Even QP can help you measure all the weight

1146
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
After this quality

1147
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I'm going to ask next

1148
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
In the database we just mentioned

1149
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
DNA produces RNA

1150
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So as long as the DNA sequence is determined

1151
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Possibility of producing RNA to produce protein

1152
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
know all

1153
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So I have a large database

1154
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I skip this first

1155
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I have a large database

1156
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
in this database

1157
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
has the sequence of each protein

1158
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
The sequence of each protein is inside

1159
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So my next step is to ask

1160
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
ask the computer

1161
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
in all your databases

1162
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
which protein sequence

1163
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Most likely to produce the quality just now

1164
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
so this time

1165
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You need to ask the computer to do the calculation for you

1166
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
follow your orders

1167
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Meet this Lizing in red

1168
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,400
specific amino acid

1169
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,760
it's just

1170
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,560
it takes every protein

1171
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
all possible theoretical

1172
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,160
Calculate it all for you

1173
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,960
So after it calculates 30,000 records

1174
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,960
Every data has

1175
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,560
Then you go to pen pair

1176
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,120
Which protein is closest to the experimental quality

1177
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,760
Then it will tell you at this time

1178
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,120
I know it's the protein

1179
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,160
So just now I omitted one

1180
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,320
So in this step three

1181
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,560
is that you have to take this result you got

1182
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,560
Send it to the computer database to do pen pairing

1183
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,520
You tell him how you're going to cut

1184
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,800
Do I have some protein?

1185
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,880
For example, we just talked about adding a zero acid

1186
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,320
it weighs differently

1187
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,320
Was it added or not?

1188
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,440
And then it's interesting

1189
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,160
you have to tell it the database

1190
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Like before we try first it used to happen

1191
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,000
a very funny thing

1192
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,680
The director of a certain hospital told us

1193
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,280
This is the patient's sample

1194
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,260
How to test is a mouse

1195
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,600
It's a mouse

1196
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,900
It was later discovered that

1197
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,900
that his sample was contaminated

1198
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,700
And there was a very serious thing that happened

1199
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:10,700
I have a friend

1200
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,700
he is in a core facility

1201
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,800
Then the detected protein is AIDS protein

1202
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,500
The HIV virus must be above P3 level

1203
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,900
can do

1204
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,200
then that

1205
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,500
Then it was a coincidence

1206
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,300
The Poster that happened to be sent for testing

1207
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,100
he has no concept

1208
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,400
He thought that AIDS came from himself

1209
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,400
This time there was no concept of a bitch

1210
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,500
so he is nervous

1211
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,700
He ran to the hospital for examination

1212
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,000
His wife also went to check

1213
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,300
Will he get AIDS

1214
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,100
Then of course not

1215
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,100
The reason that was finally found out was that

1216
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,900
that laboratory is contaminated

1217
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,900
It's that they take a cell from another lab

1218
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,500
Turns out that cell is infected with HIV

1219
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,100
that is an extremely dangerous thing

1220
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,800
Fortunately later

1221
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,400
It was my friend who detected this.

1222
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,300
AIDS detected

1223
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,500
So that lab was wiped out afterward.

1224
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,800
So Straight Spectrum Ritual A

1225
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,500
very sensitive method

1226
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,000
Then we still have a lot of fun experience

1227
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
For example, someone wants to make Taiwan's unique fish species

1228
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
fish are not genetically present

1229
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Then you have to find something similar or not as good

1230
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
to do this analysis

1231
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
ok , so a method like this

1232
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
because every protein

1233
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
the quality of the ecology it produces

1234
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
like a fingerprint

1235
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So such a method

1236
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
protein identification

1237
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Then with this method

1238
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
greatly surpassed our

1239
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Protein Analysis Challenges and Limitations

1240
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
In the past, you had to analyze a protein

1241
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
you have to save it

1242
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Then do the analysis

1243
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
One protein could take you two years

1244
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But now you only need one cell

1245
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You do paper spectrum analysis for two hours

1246
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
you get at least a few hundred

1247
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Even the data of thousands of proteins

1248
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
can know very quickly

1249
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
it all depends on

1250
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The continuous improvement of paper notation technology

1251
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and this analysis technology information technology

1252
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
This refinement of information software

1253
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,640
the next question is

1254
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,800
we have this technology

1255
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,440
then can we ask a question

1256
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,240
How many proteins are there in humans

1257
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,240
Can we, as just mentioned

1258
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,600
Human Genetic Project

1259
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,340
Genome's plan is the same

1260
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,540
Find out all the human protein maps

1261
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,400
The most crucial question is

1262
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,340
we keep asking

1263
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,840
Actually this is still unanswered

1264
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,680
Does each gene produce a corresponding protein?

1265
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
is this the answer

1266
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,880
not necessarily

1267
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,300
How much protein does a human have

1268
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,580
have no idea

1269
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,080
There's no way to be 100% sure yet

1270
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,880
Of course the more important question

1271
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,980
If we want to be able to treat diseases

1272
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,980
Learn more about life functions

1273
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,180
we want to find

1274
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,080
Key molecules in these regulation

1275
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,380
to help us understand

1276
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:51,340
even go

1277
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,340
The so-called control of the disease

1278
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,480
even suppress it

1279
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,820
that's important in this

1280
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Human Protein is under the project of relative human genome

1281
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,640
There is a very important international organization called

1282
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,000
International Protein Organization abbreviated as HuPo

1283
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,840
Then HuPo in 2012

1284
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,840
They started a huge collaborative project all over the world

1285
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,640
Then they want to be like the Human Genome Project

1286
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,600
able to convert every possible protein

1287
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,240
find it all

1288
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,400
This project was developed by several people at that time

1289
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,240
Included in Yongki Pack in Korea

1290
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,560
Hankhawk in the United States

1291
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,640
and Sweden in Europe

1292
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,240
They co-signed such a plan

1293
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,440
The level of this program is very, very many people participating

1294
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,480
A total of 25 countries are involved in this chromosome

1295
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,600
Chromosome-based Human Proteome Project

1296
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,040
Then why is it called a chromosome

1297
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,600
because it is based on chromosomes

1298
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,760
then you can see

1299
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
That is, we in Taiwan have chromosome 4

1300
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,400
One reason for picking number 4

1301
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,280
actually in the early days

1302
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,600
There are some scholars in Taiwan

1303
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,040
Especially at Yangming University

1304
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,880
when they participated in the Human Genome Project

1305
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,000
This is dominated by chromosome 4

1306
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,520
And the Alpha-Vetal Protein of liver cancer

1307
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,960
Molecules of this liver cancer

1308
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,760
on chromosome 4

1309
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,200
Then I am happiest that our mainland is here

1310
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,000
In fact, they have been suppressing us

1311
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,560
The last agreement we participated in

1312
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,120
in the name of Taiwan

1313
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,400
And they agree that we can fly the flag

1314
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
it's the thing i'm most proud of

1315
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:41,200
Then the mainland has also expanded very large in the past few years

1316
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,600
that he for... you can see

1317
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,360
He started to choose number 8

1318
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,600
Later he picked number 1

1319
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,600
In fact, the smaller the... the smaller the number, the more difficult it is

1320
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,000
because more protein

1321
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,160
Do you...know why number 1 was chosen?

1322
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,320
Because he's gonna do Number 1 and that's it

1323
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,320
so they do number 1

1324
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,640
In fact, they also asked us for help.

1325
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,300
we choose number 4

1326
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,040
Then you can also see like Japan

1327
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,340
they choose number 3

1328
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,840
then different countries

1329
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,640
like america

1330
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,180
america is here

1331
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,780
America picks No. 17

1332
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,180
Because the number 17 is the gene of the lung cancer

1333
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,180
Important genes are all on number 17

1334
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,080
Many important cancer genes are also on the 17th

1335
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,080
there is another interesting

1336
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,200
Iran chooses Y

1337
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,080
Do you know why?

1338
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,680
Because the regenerative medicine in Iran is very powerful

1339
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,880
They do a lot of that unlucky

1340
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,200
So the secret of the skewed body

1341
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,040
is what they want to know

1342
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,880
So each country they go to claim

1343
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,080
different chromosomes

1344
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,240
has a reason for it

1345
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,400
Well, the purpose actually sounds so simple.

1346
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,800
But it is very difficult directly

1347
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,080
The human genome was drafted in 2004

1348
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,000
About 20,000 genes

1349
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,240
human protein body

1350
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,400
have no idea

1351
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,080
This is a target we are looking for now

1352
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,740
that in these two years

1353
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,740
There has been a lot of importance for this work to emerge

1354
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,780
That first big job is there in

1355
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
He relied on this Pendi professor in the United States

1356
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,600
he himself is a doctor

1357
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,360
A doctor of Indian descent

1358
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,960
Then he uses a very large scale mass spectrometer

1359
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,000
he is rich

1360
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,440
He made an adult organization of 17 people

1361
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,200
6 types of hematopoietic cells

1362
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,120
7 more embryonic tissues

1363
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,560
because an idea is

1364
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,960
If there are some proteins that have never been present

1365
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,760
No evidence

1366
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,320
Could it be because he showed up very early

1367
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,600
then disappeared

1368
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,400
So he used massive mass spectrometry

1369
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,720
to identify proteins

1370
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,400
Then this article in Nature

1371
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,360
this is the first

1372
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,800
Articles in Nature

1373
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,400
In total, they identified 17,000 protins

1374
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,360
About 84% of all genes

1375
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,160
Then this article came out at the same time

1376
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,600
there is a sebecet

1377
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,720
Also in Nature

1378
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,600
There is a Professor Kusse in Germany

1379
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,600
then they are scary too

1380
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,320
He probably has a real mass spec

1381
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,760
do it hard do it hard

1382
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,200
Then got more than 18000 Protin

1383
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
These two are probably so far

1384
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,840
A sketch of the largest so-called human protein body

1385
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,440
this is appearing

1386
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,680
But after these two jobs

1387
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,680
There has been a lot of controversy

1388
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,880
The reason is Professor Pendi

1389
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,640
His mass spectrometric identification technique is very imprecise

1390
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,840
His statistics are many errors

1391
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,440
So it caused a lot of controversy

1392
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,880
after this job

1393
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,200
but i personally think

1394
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,400
Actually this is a beginning

1395
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,080
at the same time in sweden

1396
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,760
There is a crazier project

1397
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,320
This is a big project funded by the government

1398
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,560
They take every human protein

1399
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,920
all antibodies

1400
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,240
As long as the antibody is produced

1401
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,520
he organizes all

1402
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,800
Regardless of normal tissue, all cancer tissues are stained

1403
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,920
he wants to know

1404
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,800
human protein

1405
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,640
What is the performance in the whole organ?

1406
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,600
It is a very large project

1407
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,000
Then they also published in Size this year

1408
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,120
Use Tissue

1409
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,760
immunostaining

1410
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,920
So this is probably

1411
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,640
Come to the biggest break in a job

1412
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,960
after this

1413
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,960
Many other countries have also emerged

1414
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,000
to look for the so-called mesin protein

1415
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,520
let me explain here

1416
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,240
Currently about 15% protein

1417
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,560
no evidence

1418
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,600
no one knows if they exist

1419
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,240
So everyone's first goal

1420
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,640
is to make these proteins

1421
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,400
Is it possible to find all of them?

1422
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
then you can see it's funny

1423
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,160
strange material

1424
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,360
that's what i just said

1425
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,040
Because everyone will feel that they have done so much

1426
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,040
why can't i see

1427
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,000
it must be somewhere weird

1428
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,840
so you can see

1429
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,760
From sperm to pulp

1430
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,160
human beings

1431
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,720
Everyone is looking for this mesin protein

1432
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,120
On a larger scale is

1433
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,360
166個protein machine

1434
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,440
Of course we in Taiwan cannot lose

1435
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,040
loser does not lose proof

1436
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,040
we were in 2012

1437
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,440
it is through them

1438
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,840
It's not that they agree

1439
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,320
Actually they forced us to say

1440
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,160
Must be Taiwan

1441
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,840
Because we were helping others to analyze

1442
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,000
then he

1443
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,240
I think you're so good

1444
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,440
why don't you claim it

1445
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,440
So later we passed the Taiwan Proteosome Society

1446
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,440
We officially claimed chromosome 4

1447
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Then Taiwan is here

1448
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,040
Then the first goal is to put this chromosome 4

1449
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,440
able to figure out

1450
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,440
I am also very grateful to many schools

1451
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,240
Including National Taiwan University, Yang Ming, National Health Institute

1452
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,440
There are also high school, City University, etc.

1453
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,240
long root

1454
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,840
Every school raises its own money

1455
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,440
Let's do this project together

1456
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,880
Then one of our arguments is

1457
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,240
The argument in Taiwan is

1458
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,200
We don't want to go fearless in search of these proteins

1459
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,640
We want to be able to target cancer

1460
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,080
Because cancer is a common goal of these schools

1461
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,800
So we selected the membrane protein of the cell membrane

1462
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,880
because i just mentioned

1463
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:50,200
That is, 70% of them use membrane proteins as the target of drugs

1464
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,800
So in this project

1465
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,480
we found an interesting thing

1466
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,840
membrane protein

1467
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,320
It is diligently stuck on the membrane of the cell membrane

1468
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,400
On the cell membrane, it's very crisp and watery

1469
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,740
So in fact, the analysis challenge is very big

1470
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,900
So if the membrane protein of the cell membrane

1471
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,900
It's actually a very lonely area

1472
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,400
Then we did an analysis

1473
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,800
we found out that

1474
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,120
what is known so far

1475
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,300
Missing protein inside

1476
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,200
about a third

1477
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,100
all membrane proteins

1478
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,700
So we decided to say

1479
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,800
We start with the cell membrane

1480
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,900
So this is the latest issue that came out

1481
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,100
We combined my lab

1482
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,900
And Mr. Song Definition

1483
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,100
And Teacher Yang Panshi

1484
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,400
Principal Yang Panshi

1485
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,700
And Alex's professor in the United States

1486
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,400
Together we go to find these membrane proteins

1487
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,500
our thoughts

1488
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,900
Our hypothesis is

1489
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,300
If membrane proteins are important

1490
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,700
Well, let me pick a cancer first.

1491
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,100
So we analyzed twenty pairs of lung cancer tissues

1492
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,400
Cells from eleven types of lung cancer were analyzed

1493
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,200
Then we found

1494
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,100
Actually we should be

1495
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,700
The most in this issue

1496
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,000
There are 178

1497
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Mission protein

1498
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,340
Then you can see these 178 Mission proteins

1499
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,340
distributed on different chromosomes

1500
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,000
Nine of them are on chromosome 4

1501
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,460
We found that in fact

1502
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,900
often have a lot of protection

1503
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,740
Let's say there are 9 new GPCRs

1504
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,140
This is currently the most important drug target

1505
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,740
In fact we identified that it exists

1506
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,500
We also verify that it exists

1507
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,300
but what is its function

1508
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,460
we welcome the people behind

1509
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,700
able to continue to work it out

1510
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,700
the most important is

1511
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,860
these are so called jigsaw puzzles

1512
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,500
These are the so-called analyzes

1513
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,660
But what kind of help does it have for medicine?

1514
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,020
Can we use proteomics

1515
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,300
Come help us find new targets for cancer detection

1516
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:48,860
It's a big goal for many

1517
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,020
Let's take an example

1518
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,260
In this cancer is still a

1519
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,420
A disease with the highest fatality rate

1520
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,340
then if you go to see

1521
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,760
You see the top three lung cancer liver cancer

1522
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,360
both men and women are the same

1523
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,160
Lung cancer is now number one

1524
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,160
Then liver cancer came in second

1525
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,400
That rectal cancer has been on the rise

1526
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,160
third place

1527
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,760
In addition to the so-called detection molecules for liver cancer

1528
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,760
And that detector molecule it's not very good

1529
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,960
There are no molecular tests for lung cancer and colorectal cancer

1530
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,560
It all depends on the diameter of the large intestine

1531
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,960
or you go to take a picture

1532
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,960
You go to analyze this image

1533
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,400
to be able to see

1534
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,960
None of the molecular tests

1535
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,960
So if in summary

1536
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,760
currently in clinical use

1537
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,160
These cancer marker proteins are very, very limited

1538
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,360
that's all

1539
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,760
Many diseases are not tested

1540
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,960
so we keep asking

1541
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,160
Can we go find new marker proteins

1542
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,760
So what is a marker protein?

1543
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,760
it means

1544
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,360
when you are sick or when you have a symptom

1545
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,240
not necessarily sick

1546
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,560
For example, you can be high

1547
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,600
when a particular symptom

1548
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,800
If there is a large increase in protein under this symptom

1549
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,600
And this large increase is due to the disease

1550
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,960
or its specific

1551
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,040
Then we call this protein a marker protein

1552
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,160
Then this marker protein is very, very important

1553
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,120
you can help the doctor

1554
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,400
For example, some proteins can tell you

1555
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,040
This of the prevention of cardiovascular disease

1556
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,760
marker protein

1557
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,760
or like a cancer target

1558
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,960
you can test first

1559
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,480
Does EGFR show

1560
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,440
Is there a mutation

1561
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,360
Only you can eat this shit

1562
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,800
Soaring soaring will be effective

1563
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,960
So if these marker proteins

1564
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,000
Then we can actually do something like this

1565
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,840
Can there be more diseases?

1566
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,800
be detected earlier

1567
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,520
especially many diseases

1568
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,880
still rely on this

1569
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,080
It's the doctor's judgment

1570
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,960
without any molecular detection or even imaging methods

1571
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,480
Are there any successful examples?

1572
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,120
I tell you there are

1573
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:00,240
This OVA1 is a software for

1574
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
A kit that loves detection

1575
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,200
is the world's first proteomics

1576
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,000
Developed cancer detection reagents

1577
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,560
The earliest prototypes were made in the United States

1578
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,200
This Daniel Chien professor at John Hopkins

1579
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,760
what they developed

1580
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,440
Then this research and development in 2009

1581
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,760
They were later transferred to a company

1582
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,520
Then this 2009 officially passed the FDA certification

1583
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,840
he can get tested

1584
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,360
Then he targets this malignant tumor

1585
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,840
The detection rate of malignant ovarian tumors is as high as 96%.

1586
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Then his normal person is

1587
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,120
He has a 95% correct rate without problems

1588
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,800
so is a very correct

1589
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,880
It is a reagent with high accuracy

1590
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,440
In the traditional detection method of ovarian cancer

1591
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,240
In fact, everyone is currently using the CA125

1592
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,280
i just mentioned

1593
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,720
But this Mark is in many, many diseases

1594
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,440
will increase, not necessarily ovarian cancer

1595
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:00,000
of course

1596
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,400
then you can go for an ultrasound

1597
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,120
But this requires manual judgment

1598
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,840
And when it's sonified

1599
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,840
Actually, it's already a big piece.

1600
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,840
Unable to do this early detection

1601
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,120
So in this Professor Daniel Chuen

1602
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,520
They just want to be able to use

1603
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,120
proteomic methods

1604
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,120
to find new detections

1605
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,280
Then this method is actually

1606
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,000
One of the simplest methods in proteomics

1607
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,520
They took the patient

1608
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,560
Take the blood of healthy testers for testing

1609
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:29,760
Fat test stocks

1610
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,760
So this is a fat stock chart

1611
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,520
Then every time you see one, it means

1612
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,360
Oh this is so-and-so protein

1613
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,720
Then it is more concentrated

1614
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,960
the higher its signal

1615
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,600
Then it is for convenience to analyze

1616
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,160
it puts this high and low

1617
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,840
transform like this image

1618
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,280
The darker the color, the higher the concentration

1619
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,800
Well then it uses this principle

1620
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,000
To analyze patients with soft bank cancer

1621
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,480
patient with health tester

1622
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,120
Then everyone can digest for 10 seconds

1623
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,480
Anyone see anything different?

1624
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,020
It's not easy to see

1625
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,400
actually it's pretty awesome

1626
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,860
if i see this result

1627
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,260
I feel bad

1628
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,960
look carefully

1629
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,460
This one over here

1630
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,100
here is a protein

1631
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,900
is this straightening

1632
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,660
Then the other one is called

1633
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,660
Aolipo suggests A1

1634
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,460
if you look carefully

1635
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,100
this place this one

1636
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:23,760
Projector is a bit unclear

1637
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,760
I use to talk

1638
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,300
just in

1639
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,300
The concentration is decreased when the patient

1640
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,900
Then there is actually

1641
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,300
This concentration is slightly higher

1642
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,300
just darker

1643
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,700
you can't see it now

1644
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,700
So in this example

1645
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,700
They found that three proteins

1646
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,900
Patients with soft-nest cancer followed healthy testers

1647
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,500
Expressed concentration is not the same

1648
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,100
So then put this

1649
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,100
they have another article

1650
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,700
How many articles are there in total

1651
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,700
Then they take this seven proteins

1652
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,700
Credit to Virvanian

1653
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
This company

1654
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,660
Then this company has these seven proteins

1655
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,460
to do it on a large scale

1656
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,460
It's a clinical test in several medical centers

1657
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:11,160
Finally, a combination of these five proteins was found

1658
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,160
You can do this test of OVA1

1659
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,160
OK, so after this test is done,

1660
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,920
it can target is

1661
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,760
The one before and after the period

1662
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,620
it has a different score

1663
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,160
it will tell you

1664
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,760
Your current tumor

1665
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,480
Is it a malignant or benign tumor

1666
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,360
If a benign tumor

1667
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,560
Back to obstetrics of course

1668
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,760
Malignant tumors need to be treated

1669
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,920
After the reagent comes out

1670
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,320
You can see it in 2012 when

1671
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,620
Has reached as high as 10,000 to 20,000 reagents

1672
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,080
used in the US

1673
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,400
So this is a successful

1674
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,720
This result translated from proteomics

1675
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,320
But here I want to tell you

1676
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,120
In fact, Professor Daniel Chuen

1677
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,640
The one he passed FDA in this kit

1678
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
when he gave his first speech

1679
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,500
He will tell you as soon as he goes up

1680
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,500
just tell everyone

1681
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
Nine years ago I told you it would work

1682
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,500
In fact, no one believed that he would succeed.

1683
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,000
The development took nine years

1684
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,500
Therefore, when the biotechnology industry has many

1685
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,500
is a long

1686
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,500
because you have to do a lot

1687
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,000
a generation of four seasons

1688
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,500
From the seven proteins how

1689
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,000
in the beginning from a pile of blood

1690
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,500
how to pick seven

1691
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,000
How to reduce seven to five

1692
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,500
how to do five

1693
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:27,500
then this

1694
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,500
It depends on how high or low the concentration is

1695
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,500
Where do you cut to do testing

1696
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,500
Then you want every doctor to cooperate with you

1697
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,500
and multiple medical centers

1698
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,500
do it together

1699
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,500
So this is actually a

1700
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,500
very long process

1701
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,500
So we also want

1702
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
Please give the hospital more time

1703
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
We are working hard on research

1704
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,500
Another very important job

1705
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,500
was published last year

1706
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,500
just doing a test

1707
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,500
National Institutes of Health

1708
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,500
Is doing clinical proteomics

1709
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:58,500
teacher in school

1710
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,500
That's a scary one too

1711
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,280
They are jointly conducted by five research units

1712
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,280
including John Hopkins

1713
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,580
Included in Frey Hutchinson

1714
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,080
a well-known research unit

1715
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,080
an alliance to do together

1716
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,880
they want to ask

1717
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,280
Is it possible to learn from the gene body and the protein body

1718
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,880
combine the two

1719
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,000
Come tell us common sense cancer

1720
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Can it be divided into different types

1721
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,600
that's actually very important

1722
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,000
Because common sense grows in the United States

1723
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,400
Then let's look at the genome

1724
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,600
This picture is a bit complicated

1725
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,800
but let me explain

1726
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
I only talk about the genetic part

1727
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,800
in genetic analysis

1728
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,800
they are very large

1729
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,800
Spend a lot of money doing genome analysis

1730
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,800
100 people

1731
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,800
You can see that the genes are divided into three large

1732
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,800
Then this black, yellow and blue

1733
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,800
In fact, it is divided into three major

1734
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,800
that big one is

1735
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,800
I don't want to talk

1736
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,800
this may be too complicated

1737
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,800
three different types

1738
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,800
But if you look at protein

1739
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,800
This one is protein

1740
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
it can be clearly

1741
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,500
Divided into five major

1742
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,100
Then they later discovered that the five large

1743
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,800
Actually there is a district

1744
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,800
There is an area of ​​this area of ​​C

1745
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,200
It's so fine, I can't see it

1746
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,900
It is interesting that the type of C

1747
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,200
adipose bowel cancer in the second stage

1748
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,000
And what?

1749
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,400
It's more like that tumor stem cell

1750
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,700
because many people think

1751
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,100
Stem cells are responsible for cancer recurrence

1752
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,400
one of the most culprits

1753
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,600
So they found out that

1754
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,800
C's as long as there are C's this group of people

1755
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,200
all in the second issue

1756
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,400
Then much like the nature of stem cells

1757
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,100
So they judge from this side that

1758
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,200
If it looks like C from this organization

1759
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:38,300
that may require special attention

1760
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,300
Because of it the patient's recovery

1761
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,400
may not be added

1762
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,700
The doctor should do more aggressive treatment

1763
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,800
so from here

1764
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:47,500
you can understand that

1765
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,000
Gene sees three types

1766
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:51,200
But the protein sees the five types

1767
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,100
So you can see in this

1768
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,100
each row

1769
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,200
Each row represents a protein

1770
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,600
every one

1771
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,400
what is it called

1772
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,760
One is all right, each one represents a patient

1773
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,080
so you can see

1774
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,320
Then the red, red, blue and blue represent

1775
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:09,800
May be higher or lower in concentration

1776
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,360
The redder the higher the concentration

1777
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,000
The bluer is the lower the concentration

1778
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,920
So you use this analysis of the protein

1779
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,240
You can in fact very clearly classify all patients

1780
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,240
Divided into five major

1781
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,240
Then this is for future doctors after surgery

1782
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,440
He can go to assist the doctor to judge

1783
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:29,240
Should these people be treated more aggressively afterward?

1784
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,960
or general treatment

1785
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,080
that's a lot of work

1786
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,400
Then we also want to say

1787
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:39,240
Can we develop some new methods

1788
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,680
Especially I just mentioned lung cancer in Taiwan and lung cancer in foreign countries

1789
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,240
Lung cancer in Asia is very different from lung cancer in the West

1790
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,600
But if you go to the hospital

1791
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,680
All treatments are imported from the West

1792
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,280
so I've always wanted to be able to target

1793
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,360
We are unique to these problems to do this

1794
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,080
The other one is in this methodology

1795
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Personalized medicine

1796
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,760
Definitely the era of the future

1797
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,000
So if you want to do personalized medicine

1798
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,600
Must have personal testing tools

1799
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,200
in order to do the corresponding response

1800
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,000
So what we've been developing is

1801
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,400
Strategies for Personalized Proteome Analysis

1802
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:21,200
This is my personal research interest

1803
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,760
analysis of the patient

1804
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,600
Actually you have a lot of challenges

1805
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,000
because you have to do enough patients

1806
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,600
in order to conclude

1807
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,000
So you are above the method

1808
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,640
you wish it was as simple as possible

1809
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,800
Usually the doctor must take most of the specimens

1810
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,400
take it for medical treatment

1811
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,240
Then only a small part will be given to you

1812
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,200
Especially the earlier patients

1813
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,040
Your samples are getting less and less

1814
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,800
So microanalysis is also an important thing

1815
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,640
then of course you wish

1816
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,800
can do this analysis very quickly

1817
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,440
In addition, we think that

1818
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,840
In cancer tissue is actually an analysis

1819
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,240
cancer marker protein

1820
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,880
a good material

1821
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,760
The reason is already large and has been found

1822
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:04,760
This is the blood vessel

1823
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:08,160
Usually the tumor is near the blood vessel

1824
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,160
on this tumor

1825
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,960
Marker protein on this tumor

1826
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,160
Its concentration is usually the highest

1827
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,160
It is very likely that these proteins

1828
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,960
in many ways

1829
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,920
Including through the cancer cells will come out

1830
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,360
So now many people are testing their blood

1831
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,960
circulating tumor cells

1832
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,720
In addition, this cell grinding protein

1833
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,880
it has a mechanism

1834
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,520
It's going to come out with the front end cut off

1835
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,800
the last one is

1836
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,280
There are many scissor-like enzymes on the tumor

1837
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,320
it cuts these proteins

1838
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,960
So through these three mechanisms

1839
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,080
We thought if I could analyze

1840
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,560
protein on tumor

1841
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,960
then go to the blood

1842
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,720
I can do so-called non-invasive tests

1843
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,560
I'm going to do a blood test

1844
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,520
The most important thing is when you are in the concentration above

1845
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,920
The difference in concentration after running down is 1500

1846
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,400
So in terms of analysis

1847
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,060
In fact, it is relatively easy to analyze this high concentration.

1848
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,360
this is what we think

1849
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,700
we were a few years ago

1850
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,700
first developed a

1851
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:13,200
Analytical methods for personalization

1852
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,900
This example is with

1853
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:18,360
Dr. Chen Jingxun at Changgan Hospital

1854
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,200
he is a very good surgeon

1855
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,640
If you go to see the current colorectal cancer

1856
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,160
All are invasive analysis methods

1857
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,200
In fact, there is no such method for molecular detection

1858
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,360
So we analyzed

1859
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,460
we developed a

1860
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,260
Very easy way in three steps

1861
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:40,160
For each patient, we analyze his cancer tissue

1862
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,960
normal tissue near the cancer

1863
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,020
Because we think people are very different from each other

1864
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,900
Like the Nature article I just mentioned

1865
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:52,460
US NCI they only analyze cancer tissue

1866
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,920
he didn't actually go to see

1867
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,160
Differences between normal tissue and cancer

1868
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,200
We think people are too different

1869
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,080
You are better than people

1870
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,960
not too many variables

1871
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,560
So what we hope to do is to compare ourselves

1872
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,120
It's your own cancer compared to your own normal tissue

1873
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,200
So everyone just compares themselves

1874
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,880
Then we went to analyze this

1875
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,360
we just kept mentioning

1876
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,240
membrane protein

1877
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,560
Then we analyzed a total of 28

1878
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,560
patients at different times

1879
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,000
that in the process

1880
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,760
In fact, information is a very, very big challenge

1881
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,400
Our fatty skin produces

1882
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,040
It could be 100,000 graphs

1883
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,560
You can't do the comparison manually

1884
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,960
That's about 7 or 8 years or 4 years in the past

1885
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,920
we are very very grateful

1886
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,440
at the Central Plains Institute Information Office

1887
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,120
Teacher Song Deyi and Teacher Xu Wennian

1888
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,920
We co-developed a lot of software

1889
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,400
without their assistance

1890
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,840
we have no way

1891
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,760
that data is huge

1892
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:53,720
then advertise

1893
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,240
That teacher Xu Wennian is the inventor of the natural input method

1894
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,240
I advertise for him

1895
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,640
Please use it more

1896
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
But into the law

1897
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:02,960
But he said he didn't make a dime

1898
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,160
let everyone use

1899
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,120
ok so in the process

1900
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,320
In this new method

1901
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,720
The first thing we ask is

1902
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,320
Can we measure

1903
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,760
already in clinical use

1904
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,120
The molecule CEA

1905
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,360
because it means that your method is feasible

1906
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,600
that's good of course

1907
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,520
we can easily detect

1908
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:20,720
then you can see

1909
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,480
everyone

1910
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,360
If you compare cancer tissue to normal tissue

1911
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,840
You go and see this increase in protein concentration

1912
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,200
nearly three times

1913
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,520
that another patient

1914
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,160
about three times

1915
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:31,960
several times

1916
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:32,760
ok so say

1917
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,640
Our strategy idea should be OK

1918
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,680
You can easily see it from the organization

1919
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,240
That

1920
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,440
Then here you can see

1921
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,040
why personalize

1922
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,760
The red dot represents

1923
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,600
Concentrations in cancer are increased

1924
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,440
Click on the big rep for this protein

1925
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,120
The more the concentration increases

1926
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,040
ok so you can see

1927
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,160
In addition to CEA

1928
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,040
In fact, there is a lot of protein

1929
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,440
is worth doing

1930
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,600
Good but it was a pity for the times

1931
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,600
A lot of people

1932
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,760
If you want to verify the antibody is not acceptable

1933
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,040
Then I think our lab will go back now

1934
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,800
Let's do it with branch spectrum

1935
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,800
Then if you use the traditional method

1936
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,960
The previous method is that the sensitivity is not good enough

1937
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,920
So he has to put all the simplified

1938
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,560
mix it all up

1939
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,000
Then become a group of normal, a group of cancer

1940
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,400
but sometimes

1941
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:20,960
For example, look at this example

1942
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,800
If I look at his average

1943
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,560
This concentration looks high

1944
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:26,960
You thought it was a good test to do

1945
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,400
Actually wrong

1946
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,320
It is because A is actually the two

1947
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,000
There are two strange patients with particularly high concentrations

1948
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,600
So on average, his concentration is very high

1949
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,880
In fact, just because two people increase

1950
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,480
that a good test

1951
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:41,600
You want most people to be able to increase

1952
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:42,720
are increased

1953
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,360
You can single out most of the patients

1954
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,600
so from here

1955
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,400
I want to remind everyone that

1956
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,680
Design of Experiments in Doing Research

1957
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:54,520
Special consideration must be given to individual differences

1958
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,080
actually very big

1959
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,840
Here we are very grateful to Chang Root University

1960
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,840
Professor Dechang Zhan and Professor Yu Zhaosong

1961
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
They did the back for us

1962
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,640
Method of staining with tissue

1963
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,360
Go find a Stone II protein

1964
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,920
Then you can distinguish

1965
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:16,200
Normal Washed Meat and Colorectal Cancer Tissue

1966
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,040
Of these 400 patients

1967
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,840
So say this protein

1968
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,200
yes can do aftercare

1969
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,360
can go and see how it is

1970
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,360
Then we also look at its five-year survival rate

1971
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,520
we found that

1972
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,240
If the protein concentration is relatively high

1973
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,960
This axis is represented by

1974
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,440
It's the chance of being alive within five years

1975
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,280
this represents time

1976
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,760
You can see that the survival rate is relatively low

1977
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,280
If the protein concentration is lower

1978
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,680
higher survival rate

1979
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,720
So representing the concentration of this protein

1980
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,360
With this patient with colorectal fatty bowel cancer

1981
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,440
Can you live a good life?

1982
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,800
or we say later

1983
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,520
is an indicator that may be used

1984
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,800
Then you can see that the five-year survival rate is high

1985
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Only 42% of those with high performance

1986
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,460
If the patient's concentration is relatively low

1987
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,160
His survival rate is relatively high, 75%

1988
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:09,360
The last thing we want to ask is

1989
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,200
Can I do a test?

1990
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,400
then you can see we don't do a lot

1991
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:15,960
75 patients

1992
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,800
then you can see in the blood

1993
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,760
this protein exists

1994
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,560
Then if you use the CEA used in this hospital

1995
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,920
he's really bad

1996
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,200
early diagnosis

1997
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,560
Only 14% of him can detect it

1998
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,520
But if you add stone2

1999
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,680
If stone2 can be used to measure 69%

2000
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:34,520
Then if you put two pits

2001
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:37,480
76% can be seen

2002
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,880
So from here I think I'll tell you

2003
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,240
In fact, proteomics is a

2004
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,760
help you find possible

2005
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,120
A new method for the identification of marker proteins

2006
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,840
Of course there are still many problems

2007
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,160
For example, we just talked about protein concentration

2008
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,080
protein modification

2009
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,440
include sugar plan

2010
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,080
he regulates the immune system

2011
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,960
into the protein

2012
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,160
Acidifying it will regulate the transmission of messages

2013
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,560
These are also very important

2014
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,960
to regulate the process of message transmission

2015
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,760
I just said that

2016
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,320
So we also hope to have a good way

2017
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,800
able to take the whole system

2018
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,320
able to identify

2019
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,960
then we wish to say

2020
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,360
able in the process

2021
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,600
to find a molecule in the middle of the messaging

2022
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,360
to develop something like this

2023
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,560
A strategy to block a target of protein acidification

2024
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,520
that's in this part

2025
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,160
We also developed a new method

2026
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,960
When we say an acidification or a modification

2027
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,120
if chemical reaction

2028
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,120
it is known

2029
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,680
We have to go after the chemical reaction

2030
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,160
what dose it responds to

2031
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,440
Let's say 400 percent is complete

2032
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,960
Still 30% deep dance

2033
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,680
But in the field of spiritual acidification

2034
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:51,760
we discover

2035
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,280
It seems that everyone doesn't care much about this matter.

2036
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:55,360
just ask

2037
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:56,760
Is this protein acidified?

2038
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,520
it doubles five times

2039
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,120
Naling is acidified to the end

2040
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,600
Thirty-three percent

2041
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:04,160
one third acidified

2042
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,600
Or are they all acidified?

2043
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:11,200
In fact, no one has asked this question

2044
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:13,760
so we last year

2045
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,000
No this year

2046
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
We published a new method

2047
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,800
We measure protein phosphorylation

2048
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,200
drug resistance in lung cancer

2049
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:26,600
Is it possible to do something new for this answer

2050
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,600
So we went to analyze

2051
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,400
This drug-resistant lung cancer

2052
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,400
sorry

2053
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,500
According to the cells that are sensitive to this Aretha

2054
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,400
and lung cancer cells resistant to it

2055
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:42,600
we want to ask

2056
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:46,000
What molecules can produce drug resistance

2057
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,800
then we will analyze

2058
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,800
use this method to analyze

2059
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,000
For the law and CK2

2060
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,600
These two very important ones

2061
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,000
well they will acidify

2062
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,400
then we should say accident

2063
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,100
this is a bit

2064
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,600
surprised find says

2065
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,940
In this network of protein actions

2066
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:07,400
We found that these large changes

2067
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,640
The red moon represents the time of drug resistance

2068
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,640
Its concentration increases

2069
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,780
We found these molecules

2070
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:18,540
Its change is not due to the concentration of the protein

2071
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,280
It comes from an increase in protein zero acidification

2072
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,080
That is to say, in this control

2073
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,580
We found zero acidification changes

2074
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,620
may be more important than changes in concentration

2075
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:33,340
I can't show a data today

2076
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:34,820
But one of the molecules

2077
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,180
With the assistance of Yang Panchi and Principal Yang

2078
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,580
We found that after kicking out that molecule

2079
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:42,620
drug resistant cells

2080
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,920
Cells Reverted to Sensitivity

2081
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,580
So I guess it's also proteomics

2082
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,240
able to tell us

2083
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,180
Mechanisms of the disease, mechanisms of drug resistance

2084
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,140
what exactly is it

2085
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:56,240
and then give it to biologists or chemists

2086
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,200
to design a new therapy

2087
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,080
that last

2088
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,240
I'll talk about it in two or three minutes later.

2089
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:07,540
In the above, these are more personal research.

2090
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:11,200
In fact, everyone in Taiwan has realized that

2091
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:15,240
It is very important to deal with cancer and disease

2092
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,840
So there are some big medical universities in Academia Sinica

2093
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,800
With the efforts of the medical center

2094
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,280
In fact, there are several very important projects

2095
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,240
in progress

2096
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,080
First of all, the first one is the Taiwan Human Biology Database

2097
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,840
I don't know if you guys have heard of this

2098
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:37,640
Is there? There are many taxis

2099
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:40,080
did you notice

2100
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,040
I think it's a big project that I really admire

2101
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,640
This project actually started from Academia Sinica

2102
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,140
to lead to the idea of ​​blood

2103
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,440
The idea is to say

2104
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,440
If we are going to get to know Taiwanese well

2105
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,040
generation of disease

2106
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,840
Then should we take the samples of the Taiwanese first?

2107
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Whether it is a patient or a sample from the community

2108
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
collect first

2109
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and after collecting

2110
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Through our long-term follow-up

2111
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
to understand their clinical development

2112
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and their living habits

2113
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
health blah blah

2114
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Then put these data

2115
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
put these data

2116
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
biochemical reaction with him

2117
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
make a link

2118
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
to find out the cause of the disease

2119
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
because it involves

2120
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,000
very very large quantity

2121
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
According to my personal knowledge

2122
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
They are actually legislating

2123
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
made a lot of effort

2124
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
then go talk to the legislature

2125
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
talk to the government

2126
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
It was finally passed in 2012

2127
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
The plan is actually

2128
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
very ambitious plan

2129
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
currently run by

2130
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Liu Fudong, director of the House Voice Institute

2131
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
And the CEO Shen Zhiyang

2132
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Then the main reason is

2133
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
hope to understand

2134
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Common Slow Disappearance

2135
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,860
A relationship between STD genes and the environment

2136
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:05,820
Then go to find out the factor of this cure

2137
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:07,820
that's funded by the government

2138
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,320
I don't know if I will finish in the future

2139
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,820
this is what they told me

2140
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,820
then if the government goes bankrupt

2141
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:15,820
I don't know what will happen to this

2142
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:17,820
But now they are working hard

2143
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:20,320
to carry out such a large project

2144
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,820
Then this plan was also received by many

2145
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,320
Echoes from the hospital

2146
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,820
So at the moment from north to south

2147
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:28,820
There are very, very large hospitals

2148
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,820
All medical centers are participating in this program

2149
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:32,820
Then this plan is from

2150
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:34,820
2012 to 2024

2151
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,820
Then they hope to collect 200,000

2152
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,820
Specimens from the general public and 100,000 patients

2153
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:40,820
so everyone here

2154
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,820
If anyone is interested in this

2155
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,820
very very hope you will

2156
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,820
To be a sample of this people

2157
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:48,820
then they will help you for a long time

2158
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,820
Track your health and life

2159
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,820
And the data of your sample

2160
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,820
so this actually knows something about you

2161
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,820
You are also very helpful personally

2162
01:23:56,820 --> 01:23:58,820
There are branches everywhere from south to north

2163
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:00,820
you can go

2164
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,240
tell them you want this sample

2165
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:06,740
At the same time, an interesting thing happened

2166
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:10,340
This Leigh-Hawaiers is from 2001

2167
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:12,440
Nobel Prize in Physiology

2168
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,440
Then his important discovery is

2169
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,100
He found a way to control that cell cycle

2170
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:20,300
Sale cycle some key elements of this molecule

2171
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:24,440
Then I think the Nobel Prize-winning team won the prize

2172
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,100
They seem to be starting to think

2173
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,640
It's a social problem, a big problem in the world

2174
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,140
So he started to travel around the world

2175
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,140
He wants to advocate a

2176
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:35,640
The concept of Bio-Synics

2177
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,640
This Bio-Synics is like a marker molecule

2178
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,840
He thinks that the detection of cancer or disease

2179
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:44,840
is a very important thing

2180
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:47,640
is an important strategy for sustainable health

2181
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,040
But this requires a lot of effort

2182
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,440
Less able to be done by individual labs

2183
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,840
He believes that the power of the state should be

2184
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,440
Production, government and education work together

2185
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:57,940
So he traveled around the world

2186
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,940
To promote the concept of Bio-Synics

2187
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
He also came to Taiwan to advocate

2188
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
So later under his impetus

2189
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Washup was opened twice in Academia Sinica and Beijing Medical University

2190
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Formally established in 2012

2191
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Because the Taiwan divine body biological database just now

2192
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Specimens have

2193
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So this 2002 Taiwan Barsini School

2194
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
hitch a ride

2195
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You can see the five major hospitals in the first issue

2196
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
The five major projects are all very important diseases in Taiwan

2197
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:34,000
This leader is all this doctor

2198
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Expanded to 13 projects in 2013

2199
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Then I know there are 14 projects now

2200
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
This project is actually related to the Taiwan Human Biology Database

2201
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
are complementary

2202
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Hoping to develop marker molecules for disease

2203
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
for this important goal

2204
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
From this place, I also deeply feel that

2205
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
In fact, most of these projects are medical teams

2206
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
But what is lacking is

2207
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Platforms for these high performance analytics

2208
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Analytical talent

2209
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,800
In fact, under this plan

2210
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,000
i think we can go

2211
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
contribute our technology

2212
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
so i personally think

2213
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,500
in Taiwan

2214
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,000
I'm glad we have

2215
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
The Human Biodatabase

2216
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
With this Taiwanese Balsney

2217
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Our two projects can work together

2218
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
then we hope the future

2219
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,500
this is my personal expectation

2220
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,700
I always feel

2221
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,500
Many phenomena in the so-called life sciences

2222
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:30,500
In fact, many times

2223
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,500
we are a descriptive phenomenon

2224
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,000
But from a chemical point of view

2225
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,500
I think many things should be

2226
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,000
countable

2227
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
can put this molecule

2228
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,500
get out one by one

2229
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,000
so i hope

2230
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,500
will be able to

2231
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,500
for these important diseases

2232
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,500
we can

2233
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,000
not only me

2234
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Everyone together

2235
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,500
able to convert this protein

2236
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,000
how to do messaging

2237
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
able to do a digital

2238
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
of course

2239
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,500
there are many things that are

2240
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,000
can do

2241
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,500
we hope

2242
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,500
Currently, except for this plan

2243
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,680
Academician Cai Mingdao of Zhongyuan Academy

2244
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,440
Under the leadership of Academician Wang Huijun

2245
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,480
There is also a Taiwanese protein project

2246
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,840
I am personally responsible for the part of the protein body

2247
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:14,680
We hope that with these large integrations

2248
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:17,040
collaboration with physicians with biologists

2249
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,120
with chemists and statisticians

2250
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,760
Integration of Informatics

2251
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:23,360
We want to be able to target diseases that are specific to Taiwan

2252
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:24,880
like i just mentioned

2253
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,760
Taiwan-specific lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer

2254
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,640
these three diseases

2255
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,240
We hope to be able to build

2256
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,080
the protein web database

2257
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,640
Once established

2258
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,920
our promise is

2259
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,720
We will put all the information

2260
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,320
All are open to everyone

2261
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,480
Then we hope that for Taiwan these

2262
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,320
cancer development and treatment

2263
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,960
can provide more information

2264
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,120
Let the people behind be able to do the testing

2265
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,440
or drug development

2266
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,360
But I still emphasize

2267
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,080
it takes a long time

2268
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,240
I hope you have some patience

2269
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,400
what i am most interested in

2270
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:59,800
I am in chemistry

2271
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,160
Many of my colleagues are experts in drug development

2272
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,360
So we also hope that after this network comes out,

2273
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,460
We were able to find new drug target proteins

2274
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,820
to overcome the lung cancer we were talking about

2275
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,460
have a lot of questions

2276
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:16,400
The woman with the mutation and no mutation

2277
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,460
No targeted therapy blah blah blah

2278
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,000
There is also the issue of drug resistance

2279
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:25,260
In the end, I thank many, many friends

2280
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:28,800
It's the kind of research that requires a lot of fields

2281
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,800
Therefore, we have four cooperation partners at Photobiological Information

2282
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,800
There are also foreign countries that I haven't listed yet.

2283
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,800
we have many friends who are doctors

2284
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:38,560
There are also many SaleBioL bureaus and syntheses

2285
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,960
Of course, the most important thing is that I want to thank my many students

2286
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,160
I haven't had time to put many of my new student photos in there yet.

2287
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,800
we're working hard on this

2288
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,800
We also hope to have some results in the future

2289
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,560
Last but not least, I think you can see

2290
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,560
this is a cell

2291
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,760
I think in this field

2292
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,400
it's actually very interesting very very interesting

2293
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,400
Although it is an extremely complex world

2294
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,360
then we also hope

2295
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:11,060
If any student is interested in this field

2296
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:13,760
You are welcome to explore this field together

2297
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,000
then i think i'll stop here today

2298
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
thank you all

2299
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
thank you all

2300
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
thank you all

2301
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
thank you all

2302
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
thank you all

2303
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I think everyone is really feasting on knowledge today

2304
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,500
Then we start with the most basic scientific research

2305
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:36,000
From Dr. Chen's scientific research

2306
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,000
The reason of your own illness and so on

2307
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
i believe there is

2308
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
do you want to take a break or

2309
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
so far so good

2310
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
If there is a problem or what can I ask you

2311
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
please

2312
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
that

2313
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,500
so wonderful

2314
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
I want to ask the teacher

2315
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:00,500
because now it's all about triggering

2316
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I heard that Alzheimer's is caused by the protein in the brain

2317
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It seems like our paste

2318
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Do you ask the teacher to say

2319
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
accumulation

2320
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Please explain to the teacher

2321
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
That's one big reason why Alzheimer's is happening.

2322
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
It's the protein structure that changes

2323
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
The protein after that change

2324
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
They should have been there one by one.

2325
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
that's because it changes

2326
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
so it all piles up

2327
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Yes, this is the reason everyone knows

2328
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
I know there are quite a few people

2329
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
including one of my colleagues

2330
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
that new method that they hope to develop

2331
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
able to make this process

2332
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
able to make it reply

2333
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
no more piles

2334
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
good

2335
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
ask the professor

2336
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:51,000
That one just mentioned the protein concentration

2337
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
high words

2338
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
the survival rate is relatively low

2339
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Then ask the professor what to do with that

2340
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
just say yes

2341
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,720
Does this have anything to do with what you eat?

2342
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:06,320
can reduce protein concentration

2343
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,780
The second question is

2344
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:10,440
DNA will

2345
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,700
DNA mutations create abnormalities in proteins

2346
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:17,560
then please tell me that

2347
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:20,360
under what circumstances

2348
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:24,740
or what causes DNA mutations

2349
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:25,360
Thanks

2350
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:27,680
Let me talk about the second question first

2351
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:31,440
Many of the gene mutations come from genetics

2352
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,280
For example, Mediterranean flat snow

2353
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:38,920
It may be more frequent on Hakka women

2354
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,220
like EGF

2355
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:42,820
I just talked about the mutation of the gene in lung cancer

2356
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:44,180
Actually we don't know why

2357
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:46,320
But the oriental mutation

2358
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,080
For patients, the mutation rate is as high as 60%

2359
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,680
But Westerners probably only have less than 20%

2360
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,480
20%

2361
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:54,420
so a big difference

2362
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:58,260
This should be three times worse than race

2363
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,960
The difference between 20 and 60

2364
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,460
So it's probably a genetic issue

2365
01:32:03,620 --> 01:32:05,860
As for what to eat for protein

2366
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:09,460
I'm really not an expert on this

2367
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:12,300
But actually I really don't know

2368
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,460
famous, does anyone know

2369
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:16,860
I think as far as I know it's a lot of times

2370
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,760
protein changes

2371
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,460
In fact, except you don't eat anything

2372
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:23,660
In many cases, the influence of the environment

2373
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:25,460
For example, stress can also cause

2374
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,900
Your overall physical condition, what is your metabolism?

2375
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,660
that all affect each other

2376
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:33,120
So I think it should be to maintain a healthy life schedule

2377
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,660
this should be the most important

2378
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:38,620
Then what to eat? I really don’t know if there is any participation here.

2379
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,120
that doesn't move

2380
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:41,280
will definitely

2381
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:42,660
how can you do this

2382
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,120
I already understand

2383
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,020
Like I know Ah Fa Petal Protein

2384
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,460
It should have nothing to do with this

2385
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,620
What happened when I just arrived is often like drinking

2386
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:57,420
just have some living habits

2387
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:59,740
Smoking increases lung cancer risk

2388
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
already know

2389
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:03,740
some of that may not be very clear

2390
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:05,440
That seems to be related to drinking

2391
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,780
And it has nothing to do with your staying up late.

2392
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,940
Yeah, so I think it should generally be

2393
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:12,440
or a healthy lifestyle

2394
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,980
Exercise is of course one of them.

2395
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,340
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2396
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,640
What I want to ask is that the teacher just mentioned

2397
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,600
Your lab has special

2398
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:26,660
to notice

2399
01:33:26,660 --> 01:33:28,320
for relation

2400
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,920
leaching acidification ratio

2401
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,920
In fact, it has a very significant impact

2402
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,320
But the few slides in front of you

2403
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,120
already told us all

2404
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,520
transfection followed by protein modification

2405
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,320
are very important parts

2406
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,820
It was also mentioned later when talking about straight floating.

2407
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,520
You can choose whether there is acidification or saccharification

2408
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,520
So it seems that leaching acidification with or without

2409
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,720
for your shower or other

2410
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,920
Researchers around the world should be well aware

2411
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,720
don't know why they would

2412
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:55,620
didn't notice this

2413
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,720
And you and your lab will

2414
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:00,020
Why is there a way to notice this

2415
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Then where is the key

2416
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
The other one is also what I told you today.

2417
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
The key is to say

2418
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
You work with doctors in other fields

2419
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
We also work with computer experts

2420
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
May I ask you to cooperate

2421
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
How can there be a way to cooperate

2422
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Can you pay attention to what important generosity

2423
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Thanks

2424
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Okay, thank you

2425
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
your first question

2426
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
very important and crucial

2427
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
should mean

2428
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
That is to say, people in the field of protein geology

2429
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,000
When analyzing protein zero acidification

2430
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Because it is the inner segment Peptide with zero acidification

2431
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
or Protin to extract it

2432
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So we're doing proteomic analysis

2433
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Often we just like to compare

2434
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
sick or not

2435
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
or whether there is stimulation or no stimulation

2436
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
So everyone is comparing

2437
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Triple or Triple

2438
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
but we only know

2439
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Altogether tripled

2440
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
You don't know this twice because

2441
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Possibly increased protein concentration

2442
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
so you double

2443
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
However, the degree of zero acidification remains the same

2444
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
It is also possible that the protein concentration does not change

2445
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
But zero acidification triples

2446
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,500
Before our method

2447
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,800
Everyone doesn't make a difference

2448
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,000
Then we thought of a way

2449
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,500
Let's change the concentration

2450
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,800
with protein changes

2451
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,700
we can see at the same time

2452
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:12,400
we just stumbled upon

2453
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:13,400
I'm also surprised

2454
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:14,400
because I always feel

2455
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,900
Changes in protein concentration

2456
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:17,700
should be more important

2457
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:19,100
in that experiment

2458
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:19,800
we discover

2459
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,900
Those proteins have not changed

2460
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,100
fantastic

2461
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,100
As for the second question

2462
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,100
good question

2463
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,600
I tell my own experience

2464
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,500
Because I am a very casual person

2465
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,100
Then I usually run into problems

2466
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:35,000
I will solve it

2467
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,100
Then why did you start cooperating with the news?

2468
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,500
because in the early

2469
01:35:38,500 --> 01:35:41,000
When we first analyze

2470
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,400
Computers were not good at that time

2471
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,200
So we're gonna make protein firm

2472
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,700
To send data to the Internet

2473
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,000
send it to the internet

2474
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,400
I don't know can't keep sending and sending

2475
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,300
The website that was sent later

2476
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:53,800
think we're hackers

2477
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,600
They obviously did not notify the network administrator of our Chemical Institute

2478
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,000
said to take us

2479
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,100
is the one that won't let us use

2480
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
say we are hackers

2481
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,400
Then I thought it was serious

2482
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:05,000
can't go on like this

2483
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,800
Then I happened to meet at Academia Sinica

2484
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,200
I met a middle school classmate from my elementary school in the parking lot

2485
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,200
He happened to be in teacher Xu Wennian's doctoral class

2486
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,200
Postdoc

2487
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,400
Then I asked him

2488
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,200
I was recently lodged by that Brock from NCBI

2489
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,800
Could you please write a small program

2490
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,600
So we usually cooperate in the midst of the problem

2491
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:27,200
But there is a very important key

2492
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,400
You must be able to understand his language

2493
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,400
You can't talk to a doctor to learn a language

2494
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,400
he can't understand

2495
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,800
you have to speak his language

2496
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,200
it takes time

2497
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:41,400
Then how about counting the results

2498
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:44,600
That is to say like we...

2499
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:46,400
Excuse me

2500
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:58,000
That is, I think a good cooperation is to

2501
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
special...

2502
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
open minded

2503
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,400
For example, information paper

2504
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,560
It's a very real problem

2505
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:07,560
It's who does the communication

2506
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,560
I usually don't hang up

2507
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,560
even if i help write

2508
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,060
Because this is their credit

2509
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,960
Then I think everyone should be able to share

2510
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:15,960
Common results

2511
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:16,960
this is very important

2512
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,360
What's more, you need to communicate frequently

2513
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:22,760
Then I have a very lively personality

2514
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:26,360
So I like to talk to people

2515
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,600
Yes, and my students are also important.

2516
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,600
That is, my students are willing to work with them

2517
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,600
that medicine you must

2518
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,600
is what I said must

2519
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:37,600
because doctors are busy

2520
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,600
They have free time to chat with you over there

2521
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,600
so you must know his language very well

2522
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,600
Then you have to be able to say the same thing as him

2523
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,600
he will do it with you

2524
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,600
I don't think it's that difficult

2525
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,600
But you just have to be willing to take the time to

2526
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,600
It will be fine after a long time

2527
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,600
Because when I went to the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine, actually

2528
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,600
I have never heard of an amino acid

2529
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,600
my students know

2530
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,440
Poetin protein heard

2531
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,000
But I don’t know Poetin means protein

2532
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,800
But because the life sciences of Zhongyuan Institute are too strong

2533
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:10,000
So after a long time, I learned like this

2534
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,480
Teacher thank you for your wonderful speech

2535
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,360
I have a question for your last mention of BioBank

2536
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,320
I think BioBank is a very Promise project

2537
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:27,680
Because Chronic disease is a headache for everyone

2538
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:30,400
And the problem of global aging that we are now facing

2539
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,840
Whether it is a developing country or a developing country

2540
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,600
Aging is a serious problem

2541
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,200
And then it's very relevant to chronic diseases

2542
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,120
So BioBank

2543
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,360
I think it's pretty good that we developed this

2544
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,600
For the future of Taiwan, whether it is the development of the biotechnology industry

2545
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,360
Or academic development is very good

2546
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,760
But teacher, you also mentioned earlier

2547
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,440
The concept of BioBank comes from BioSignature

2548
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,680
No, because BioBank can first

2549
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,000
OK, that's because in short my question is BioSignature

2550
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,720
It is still being promoted

2551
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,800
What about our so-called global competitors?

2552
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,520
or who the partner is

2553
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,800
is someone

2554
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:10,520
Where are similar things being done

2555
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,920
Because like our national fitness database

2556
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,320
Actually a good Ball Bank too

2557
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,640
But this is what we are

2558
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,240
Another good opportunity from the opening

2559
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:20,560
But who else is our competitor?

2560
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,560
not to compete now

2561
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,120
You know that the era of globalization is called cooperation

2562
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,280
I'll give an example

2563
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,800
Like we do that cancer tissue thing

2564
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,720
We are cooperating with NCI in the United States

2565
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,640
Why

2566
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:35,800
Because our lung cancer is a mutation of EGA

2567
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,360
Their lung cancer is a mutation of Carousal

2568
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,400
The two sides happen to be the control group

2569
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,120
so we cooperate

2570
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:46,040
So now at least I have a lot of experience

2571
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:47,880
Even though the mainland has been suppressing us

2572
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,400
But in fact they still put us

2573
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,120
as a partner

2574
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:52,520
I'm still the same

2575
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,640
because you are young

2576
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:54,720
i still want to talk

2577
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:56,760
Of course, Taiwan's resources

2578
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,000
with foreign superpowers

2579
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Support to the mainland

2580
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,540
is very rich

2581
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:04,500
But if you open your heart a little

2582
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,700
you befriend them

2583
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,500
they'll treat you like a friend

2584
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,000
So I think cooperation is the way of the future

2585
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,040
that's like competition

2586
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,440
like felay i don't think we have any competition

2587
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,000
Taiwan is doing very well

2588
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
that Ganglai's words

2589
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,200
I'm afraid there will be some competition

2590
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:20,500
Because the mainland is Ganglai for them

2591
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,340
biggest biggest goal

2592
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:25,200
But Taiwan has Taiwan's advantages

2593
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,800
Yes, I think in Taiwan

2594
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:27,600
we just go

2595
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,400
I feel like I'm going to be a little girl

2596
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,400
so i don't just do that

2597
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,100
It doesn't take a lot of resources

2598
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,400
Of course I still need some resources

2599
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,400
I want to talk to Deputy Wang

2600
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,100
But you can't use that

2601
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,400
Why did Zhifu fight with them when buying ingredients?

2602
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,000
the impossible

2603
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,200
The mainland buys 100 units at a time

2604
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,400
how do you fight him

2605
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,600
he is an institute

2606
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:46,700
then i'm just a person

2607
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:48,000
you can't fight him

2608
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,300
So what you have to do is

2609
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:52,000
Taiwan has an advantage

2610
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So why do we do Philae and Breast Cancer?

2611
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,400
In fact, it was discussed with the court

2612
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,200
Because we have breast cancer in Philae

2613
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,200
there are many

2614
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,400
powerful expert

2615
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:04,200
Shen Zhiyang's own breast cancer is doing very well

2616
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,000
And Vice President Chen Jianren is also

2617
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:06,800
What about lung cancer

2618
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,000
Principal Yang Panshi should be at the top of the world

2619
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
so i think this

2620
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,800
You just have to take advantage of Taiwan

2621
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,600
don't worry about competition

2622
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:15,800
The problem with competition is

2623
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,400
We students and our own time should be faster

2624
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,200
so

2625
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:22,200
Yes, hear no students behind

2626
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,000
Teacher, what do you mean

2627
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,200
Like our Bao Bank

2628
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,000
we are not alone

2629
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
is to focus on chronic patients

2630
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,800
I'm also special

2631
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,600
Focus more on lung cancer and breast cancer

2632
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,800
Actually I didn't let it go

2633
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,200
But if you want to see there is

2634
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,600
Actually quite sick

2635
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,200
i took it off

2636
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,600
just a lot of sickness

2637
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,400
many cancers have

2638
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,400
then new blood vessels

2639
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,600
like just asked

2640
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,400
Alzheimer's Disease Wang Chujun

2641
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,000
They are all in the plan

2642
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,800
very many diseases

2643
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:00,000
Not just chronic diseases

2644
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,400
Yes, the whole world is not only our Taiwan

2645
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,320
In collecting this so-called age-based

2646
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:07,720
and keep track of them

2647
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:09,240
many places have

2648
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,440
I know it's like Europe

2649
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,320
they have a very large

2650
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:14,680
Then they also recently asked

2651
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,320
Should Taiwan participate?

2652
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,440
But something from Taiwan

2653
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:20,600
As far as Taiwan's regulations are

2654
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,600
Simplified cannot be sent out

2655
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,360
so there is no way

2656
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,680
The one in the European Union is

2657
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:27,720
They can be exported in simplified form

2658
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,320
So if I join that league today

2659
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,240
I can apply Simplified to analyze

2660
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:32,120
European Union

2661
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,360
That's also in Hupo

2662
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:34,640
As for the Hupo I just mentioned

2663
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,320
We have signed the MOU

2664
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,880
Then Japan also has this small database

2665
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,840
There are also some in Japan

2666
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:42,320
other places

2667
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,280
I think Taiwan

2668
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,080
Should be quite large

2669
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:47,080
So I think this is a Taiwanese

2670
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:49,080
very important asset

2671
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:49,800
right

2672
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:52,120
The one in Japan has been in business for 50 years

2673
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,280
So I told Shen Zhiyang

2674
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,240
You better live another 50 years

2675
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,240
to support this database

2676
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,200
50 years old

2677
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:00,120
If you want to track a group

2678
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
50 years is not easy

2679
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
that's a very important asset

2680
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
May I ask the professor, how does cancer arise?

2681
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Thanks

2682
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Maybe I'm not the best person to answer

2683
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
is there any

2684
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Maybe we should invite Principal Yang Tengci to explain

2685
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I say it like this

2686
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
There are many, many causes of cancer

2687
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
That is, it may be like the mutation of the gene I just mentioned

2688
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
A genetic change is a

2689
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
like many so-called autocancers

2690
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Genes that cause cancer are well known

2691
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
that protein will also

2692
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
But in the end then this happened

2693
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
related to environmental factors

2694
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
like i just said about smoking

2695
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And that one, a woman who gave birth to a D child very late.

2696
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Cancer is relatively intense is high

2697
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
many environmental factors

2698
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,000
but if you want to ask

2699
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Which is the main reason

2700
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,040
no standard answer

2701
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,440
Like that Lee Harvey just now

2702
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,480
when he came to taiwan

2703
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:10,960
We held a careful workshop

2704
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,000
Then I asked him

2705
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,080
because they america do everything

2706
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:16,540
This gene sports also do

2707
01:44:16,540 --> 01:44:17,360
Agents also do

2708
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,160
do everything

2709
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:18,840
ask him

2710
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,160
Which is the most important molecule in nature

2711
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,320
he said his statement was funny

2712
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,040
He said that so far there is no standard answer

2713
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,280
so everyone doesn't know

2714
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,240
So each one should be done

2715
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,440
this is his answer

2716
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:35,520
So there are many causes of his cancer

2717
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,400
that seems to have a theory that says

2718
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:40,680
you have some so-called cancer stem cells in your body

2719
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,160
he hides over there

2720
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,560
Then when environmental factors come out

2721
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:47,440
he is activated

2722
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,720
There is also such a saying

2723
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:51,600
May ask Yang to rebel

2724
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,480
He is better suited to answer this question

2725
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:58,440
this professor chen

2726
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:00,240
you start researching

2727
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
I've been thinking about it now, there's no skipped stitches

2728
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
And the speech and the setting are all normal.

2729
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Didn't start coughing until 93 minutes

2730
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
then i want to ask a question now

2731
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
ask a question

2732
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Now we know all about Genesis

2733
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
But cancer is still a mystery

2734
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Maybe we have a better understanding of the topic we just talked about

2735
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
protein analysis

2736
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Come as once Hanayama cancer time

2737
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
It is more reliable to track its treatment

2738
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
is it possible

2739
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
We are now old people looking forward to

2740
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Inside this protein study

2741
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
more thorough words

2742
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Huashan who can control this cancer

2743
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
is it possible

2744
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
of course it is possible

2745
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
We'd love to get to this point

2746
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
so we're doing some

2747
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
just doing some analysis

2748
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
For example, when we first arrived

2749
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
We have some cooperation with Academician Chen Peizhe

2750
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
We hope that with Teacher Yang Fuliang

2751
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
some are doing together

2752
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
It is hoped that some molecules can be found in the blood of newly arrived patients for testing

2753
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,720
Then Teacher Yang Fuliang and the others are doing the super fast one

2754
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:10,720
Reagents that can be tested at home

2755
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,320
that small instrument

2756
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,760
That's not good at talking

2757
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:15,760
kit

2758
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:16,760
right

2759
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:17,520
Am looking forward to

2760
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,320
right

2761
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,320
and certification

2762
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:20,040
right

2763
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,040
We would love to be able to reach the internal

2764
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,040
so we should have that

2765
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,440
Find that Guo Dong through the relationship

2766
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:28,720
Guo Dong today more than 100 National Taiwan University to do IZEN

2767
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:31,720
Why not come and do our blank paper research

2768
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,720
actually

2769
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,720
In fact, I think there are some three-season industries over there.

2770
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:36,720
but

2771
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,720
I think it's a pity

2772
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:38,720
sorry to say

2773
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,720
Taiwan's biotech industry is small

2774
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:44,720
So they make sure you develop it to a very mature stage

2775
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:46,720
For example, five hundred people

2776
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:48,720
The result is very sure that they are willing to become a class

2777
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:52,720
At the very early stage of so-called development

2778
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:53,720
no one wants to give you money

2779
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,720
The Central Plains Institute is willing to give us the

2780
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:57,720
thank you very much tonight

2781
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:58,720
Thanks

2782
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:14,800
You are probably doomed to eat more when you are born

2783
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,200
You ate too much earlier, you just explained

2784
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:18,200
eat less

2785
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:21,200
Did my professor just say a statistic

2786
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,400
Is it right now that I read some books

2787
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:26,300
He said that a person is born like a car

2788
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:27,500
You probably use a lot of connections

2789
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,500
probably fixed

2790
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,500
You just say about this

2791
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:34,000
Is there a corresponding saying that a person is like this

2792
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,000
You can roughly explain or eat too much has a fixed

2793
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Because I can still calculate this data

2794
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:46,500
This is probably not possible from a scientific point of view.

2795
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:48,000
but i can only say

2796
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,500
You take good care of your body, take care of your daily routine and do a good job

2797
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,000
it must be ok

2798
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Of course another angle is

2799
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,500
I'm still full of trust in things I can't see

2800
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:59,500
There are things that science can't explain

2801
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,960
man's fate

2802
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:03,460
Is it a well-structured network?

2803
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:05,160
I personally believe it

2804
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:06,960
it's not science

2805
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,660
This is not the angle of the flaming meatball

2806
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,860
Yes but in this way

2807
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:16,460
That is to say, use this biochemical method to do this thing

2808
01:48:16,460 --> 01:48:17,760
currently there is no way

2809
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,660
We can only measure these

2810
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,260
Whether protein or gene

2811
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,360
It actually just tells you an instant status

2812
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,960
that sample

2813
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,660
Or if I draw your blood now

2814
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:29,600
I will test

2815
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,060
I just detected your current state

2816
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:33,460
but i can't tell you

2817
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,860
what's your future

2818
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:36,400
or how you used to be

2819
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,200
We can only measure your current state

2820
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,060
So this problem is still rare

2821
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:48,960
You seem to be talking about the world of spirits, right?

2822
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,200
that too big effect

2823
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,760
you laugh so hard that he thinks

2824
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:57,660
There is also something about listening to the professor

2825
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,360
also believe so

2826
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,960
i like to read some other books

2827
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
I can't say too much about my identity today

2828
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,000
It's okay, professor, I'll ask for advice

2829
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
So what we just mentioned is

2830
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
The professor has about this software data analysis aspect

2831
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:20,000
So we are currently in Taiwan to test

2832
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
For example, Mr. Tanaka

2833
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Mr. Donnakar, they pour gold

2834
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
What is worth the capabilities of this developed technology

2835
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Has our current Taiwan caught up?

2836
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
when you are researching

2837
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
In the use of this instrument is there

2838
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
That's what they're making

2839
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Has been making analysis faster and more accurate

2840
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
In fact, this problem is our field

2841
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
a big challenge

2842
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Because the cost of paper Puyi is actually quite expensive

2843
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
a general instrument

2844
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Maybe 20 to 30 million

2845
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
So when your instrument comes out

2846
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
continue

2847
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,800
But from an academic point of view

2848
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,000
Unlikely to keep buying new instruments

2849
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,100
so our

2850
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,900
My own thoughts are usually

2851
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:08,800
what equipment do i have

2852
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,400
what instrument do i use

2853
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,200
Then what we hope is from

2854
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,800
Maybe go from the methodology side

2855
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,600
go do it well

2856
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,400
Of course, if Academia Sinica supports us very much

2857
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,600
or the country is very supportive of us

2858
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,900
Give us constantly new instruments

2859
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,400
that is of course ideal

2860
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,800
But I think Taiwan resources

2861
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,700
Going to talk to people like the United States or the mainland

2862
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,600
keep buying keep buying

2863
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:30,500
we may have a little difficulty

2864
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:31,500
that information

2865
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,900
In fact, Taiwan's information is very strong

2866
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:35,100
I think Taiwan's information is very strong

2867
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:37,200
Like our analysis software

2868
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,800
Teacher Song Deyi Teacher Xu Weinian

2869
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,000
their software

2870
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,700
that is very

2871
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:44,100
That is, the level of analysis is very good

2872
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,000
I think the whole world

2873
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,700
Must be the first few

2874
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:47,900
Then there's that big data

2875
01:50:47,900 --> 01:50:49,500
It is also a powerful

2876
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,200
So I think bioinformatics in Taiwan

2877
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:53,300
In fact, we can make good use of it

2878
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:55,700
an advantage

2879
01:50:55,700 --> 01:50:57,200
As for the salary of the instrument

2880
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:59,500
Or in Zhipuyi's research and development

2881
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,100
Actually in Taiwan

2882
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
some people are doing

2883
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:04,200
Like Chen Zhongxuan and Academician Chen of Genome Center of Central Plains Institute

2884
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:08,000
He has done a very good job in the research and development of Zhipuyi

2885
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,360
There is also a researcher Wang Yisheng

2886
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,360
He is also doing instrument research and development

2887
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:13,960
well done too

2888
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:29,760
Today, it is also mentioned that he only started at 93 minutes

2889
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:31,960
I'm coughing now

2890
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,760
let us thank chen

2891
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:34,720
thank you all
