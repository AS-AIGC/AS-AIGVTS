1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
music

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
music

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
music

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:42,000
music

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In the Central Research Institute,

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the lecture will begin on August 4th.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please welcome Wang Huijun, the Deputy Director of the Dean of the Department of Education.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
applause

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Dear friends and colleagues,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I AM Wang Hui Jun.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you very much for coming to this feast of knowledge

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The feast of knowledge in the Central Plains has a history of many years

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There have always been very, very good speakers to give us incisive speeches in simple terms

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Here I want to remind me that after the speech is over, the next time will be announced

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think it's better to announce it first, or I will forget later

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Therefore, the feast of knowledge in September is organized by Associate Researcher Lei Xianglin

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Our Institute of Modern History of the Central Plains

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He's going to give a lecture that has something to do with life.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Due to the meaning of Du Congming

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Mystery of Du Congming's Chinese Medicine Research

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Traditional Medical Sciences and Modernity in East Asia

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So it must have been a pretty good speech.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So please come to participate in September

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I am very happy to invite you to the feast of knowledge in the Central Plains today

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Institute of Molecular Biology

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
We all have a branch office

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,240
early annullosis

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,440
Why is it called split life?

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,520
Because wife and husband are often

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
live in a different place

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,320
So either the wife is in the US

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,880
Or the wife is in Taiwan

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,880
So this branch office was established around 1988

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,560
So it has a history of more than 20 years and almost 30 years

35
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,960
Our Sun Yihan designated researcher

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Is that time to come into the branch office

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,960
In the early days, I also participated in the establishment of some branch offices

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,760
Dr. Sun Yihan

39
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,960
What he writes here is very interesting

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,680
He said he graduated from Hsinchu Middle School

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,080
In 1974, he gave up the medical department of National Taiwan University

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,320
Then the first choice was to enter the Department of Botany, National Taiwan University

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,120
I don't know why you do this kind of thing

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,120
but anyway

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But I also gave up on this

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't have a medical degree from National Taiwan University

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I said that at that time, I heard that the score seemed to be able to enter Kaohsiung Medical University.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I didn't read one either

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I went to study chemistry

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Anyway, after he graduates

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
After graduation in Taiwan

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
to America's top universities

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Caltech to do research in biology

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
biological research over there

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Caltech I also took

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
that very small school

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But all professors are top professors

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Who is Mr. Anyway?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Leah Wood

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Leah Wood is also a very legendary figure

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Maybe wait a minute, Mr. Sun can introduce us

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Like the sequencing of this modern DNA

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Also developed by Leah Wood

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
commercialize it

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So Mr. Sun at Caltech

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
After a very solid training

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Go to 125th University as a postdoctoral fellow

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,500
It's been a while

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,500
He returned to Taiwan in 1988

70
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Join us as an associate researcher

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
that he made very contact

72
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,000
but you can tell

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He did not become a professor in three years

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
why do you know

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,500
Because Mr. Sun is very rigorous in running the academy

76
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
he must do

77
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Either do the best or don't do it

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
So he worked hard

79
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
to make these studies very touching

80
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
That's a coincidence too

81
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
After our recent Dean Liao Junzi came back

82
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
He just emphasized that we should plant but not quantity

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
In the past, everyone was aiming at a lot of papers

84
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
But that plant is not so good

85
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
What Taiwan lacks now is high-quality research

86
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Whether it is innovation

87
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
or to have a lot of this

88
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,500
How do you say this in basic research?

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,760
Guide to the updated field

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,720
So Mr. Sun is the cultural hygiene in this area

91
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,880
he did very well

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
However, in addition to doing a good job in this research, he

93
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,280
Twenty or twenty years ago, he was known as our so-called Special Review Researcher

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
That's a very rare thing

95
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Teacher Sun has been using this fruit fly

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,280
He just told me the reason why his eyes are red

97
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
wait a minute and he'll explain it to us

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:38,160
Drosophila was used very early to create what we call animal models

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Actually, you already talked about using animal mode once

100
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,960
A few years ago, it seemed that there was a self-made response

101
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,240
Today we are going to talk about the fruit fly

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,760
I just saw that fruit fly and I figured it has six legs

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,080
I asked him why

104
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,600
what are those eight legs

105
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,360
He said spiders have eight legs

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Fruit flies are something different

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
fruit flies are insects

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
what is a spider

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
anyway so do I really understand

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But the fruit fly because of its disease model

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
or wait for the creation

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
has been around for many years

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
it has something to say

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
has several nobel prizes

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
from the study of fruit flies

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
especially genetically

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
it requires understanding of development

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
words of development biology

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Drosophila is indispensable

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There are quite a lot of people who make fruit flies in our country

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There are also very touching

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There is a group of people in our Central Plains Institute

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Animals that specialize in different disease models

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
for neural research

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This Teacher Sun is a teacher in this field

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He leads a group in our Central Plains Academy

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
specialized in neuroscience research

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Our English name is NPASS

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Neuroscience Program at the Academia Cineca

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This laboratory with thirty or forty researchers is participating in this program

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Our Teacher Sun has led this group of people from the very beginning

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So he plays a very important role in neuroscience in Taiwan

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
A pusher in many fields

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So he has won many awards

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have seen this young researcher's book award

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is very rare in Academia Sinica

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
NSC End-of-Research Award

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Ministry of Education Academic Awards

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is already top in our Academia Sinica

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because we can't take the award as the professor's award here

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hou Jindui, etc.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
so many honors

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But what I admire most about him is

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
His spirit of public service is very important

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
very very rare

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He was the convener of the Biology Department of our National Science Council

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then in our TCM Hospital Academic Consulting Association

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Also served as our Deputy Executive Secretary for Life Sciences

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A while ago, he also became the vice-chairman of the National Science Council.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
that is very difficult

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's in the vice-chairman's tenure

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He also promotes these recombinations of these biological

153
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So contribute a lot

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Recently, of course, the Ministry of Science and Technology has a neuroscience project

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
he is our convener

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So today he is going to tell us some research about the fruit camp

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In addition to their very touch

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He will introduce other relevant

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So his topic "Little Fruit Builds a Great Communist Party"

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The contribution of this fruit camp to human development and disease research

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
what the hell

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
so welcome to take care of the teacher

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Soft Block Mineral Gaster

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Mineral Gaster Gaster

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So we divide it into AQ

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that is also called wind

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The fruit flies like this are what you usually think of

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the kind that endangers business

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Chinese style

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then the inner class feels different

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Fruit flies coexist with humans

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
as long as someone is in one place

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
or in spark water

174
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
can see

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,340
eat rotten fruit

176
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,840
so it doesn't harm us humans

177
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,900
Doesn't it carry anything on it that affects what

178
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,400
or some of our accelerated

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Then it can also take anything

180
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,300
Will affect the fruits and watercolors you think it doesn't hurt us

181
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,700
it eats rotten fruit

182
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,700
has rotted

183
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,900
But such a

184
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,700
it is at...

185
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,300
Its life is very fierce

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,200
from a city from

187
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,500
hold very poor mating

188
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,600
It should have a setting on it

189
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
This platform is below our normal temperature at 25 degrees

190
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,700
Just give it a piece a day

191
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Then it will go through 30% to 60% of the period

192
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,500
Then it will separate its exoskeleton

193
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,400
Do not return it and then make an impression

194
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,200
then just give it life

195
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,300
Life in this fruit camp is very interesting

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,420
Here we emphasize that its development

197
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,920
I will tell the temperature

198
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,360
Because insects it is not like we are cross-temperature

199
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,560
so the temperature inside its body

200
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,760
changes with the outside temperature

201
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
so the temperature is higher

202
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,520
Its whole development process will be faster

203
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,860
The lower the temperature, the slower its growth

204
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,960
So we can use temperature to adjust

205
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,160
Then its life is probably normal

206
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
We can be between 16 degrees and 30 degrees

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,800
can raise it

208
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,560
So we're talking about 25 degrees here

209
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,800
On that day, the embryo will be skinned.

210
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Then one day after another

211
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Twenty Another Bug Day

212
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,660
Three Zeros and Worms have three days

213
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,660
The only thing it has to do at this point

214
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,060
Just eat in the food

215
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,000
So its behavior is backlight

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
then to the ground

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,260
It burrows into that fruit and eats it

218
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,700
When it arrives, its body grows

219
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,360
In the late period of the three zeros and worms

220
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,120
it has a huge transformation

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Its behavior changed, it became like a light background

222
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
it crawls out of the food

223
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,900
then find a clean place

224
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,900
its shell hardens

225
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,100
Then it starts to form a yong

226
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,200
that's in this yong

227
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,100
Its entire body was almost completely knocked out and redone

228
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Many of these heavy cells are dying

229
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,100
Then part of the cells start to rebuild a body

230
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
so we call it a complete metamorphosis

231
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Because the individual that grew up

232
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,100
It's totally different from heavy

233
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,100
That's the same thing as a caterpillar turning into a butterfly

234
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
So what about this life history?

235
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
it basically develops twice

236
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
first time its in a short time

237
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,100
In a day it makes a heavy body

238
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,100
It can move, eat, and perform various behaviors

239
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Then when it's time to kill and redo

240
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,100
long a completely different

241
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,100
it's late

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,640
Chest is about five days

243
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Then he will open the chest shell

244
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,440
he has a sac on his head

245
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,040
He'll beat his bodily fluids into the sac

246
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,840
There is a bag on the head

247
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,040
Then let him break through the cover on the chest

248
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,840
then he crawled out

249
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
crawled out with his wings tucked together

250
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,440
Then he slowly spread his wings

251
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,600
then become a mature individual

252
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,440
What about the adult worm that hatched like this?

253
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,120
It takes about 12 hours to believe that they are mature enough to mate

254
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,200
and then the next generation

255
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,080
So very interesting life history of a

256
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,760
Why do we use fruit flies as materials

257
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,640
Then we are now doing research on many organisms

258
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,440
A very important center is the gene

259
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,640
The fruit flies are being studied because

260
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,080
He can easily find genetic mutations

261
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,240
his genes can

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
we can do screening

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, any living thing can mutate

264
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
However, the probability of mutation is usually not high

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Not high, about one thousandth of a thousandth

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's say one in ten thousand

267
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You need 10,000 fruit flies

268
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you can pick a mutant

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
is what you want

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If it is a mouse

271
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You need 10,000 mice

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then this is huge and expensive

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If you want to use elephants

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Those 10,000 elephants are unlikely to be able to conduct experiments

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So Drosophila is a multicellular organism

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
easier to feed

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Its life cycle is short

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Can give birth to many at a time

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
then we can control its mating

280
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
easy to feed

281
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
can reproduce in large numbers

282
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
that its body is small

283
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We live in a small bottle

284
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You can raise two hundred

285
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So it takes up very little space

286
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
that's basically cheap

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And fruit flies I'll talk about later

288
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
it's been over a hundred months

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,700
years of research so there are very, very many

290
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,160
resources for this research we have established a very good

291
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,460
Purebred strains, so-called purebred strains are

292
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,960
Between one of its fruit camps and another fruit camp

293
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,160
This change is very small, it is very different from people

294
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,080
Each person, this inheritance between two people

295
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,120
Variations are very, very many

296
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,300
So this makes it an experiment

297
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,340
It's a little simpler and then we also

298
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,340
After many years of research across the field

299
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,840
built many, many tools that allow us to manipulate

300
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,140
So it has a lot of the convenience of these experiments above

301
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Then with these conditions, we can go to filter

302
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,340
The picture changes, let's talk about it later

303
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,840
Then Tubian will find the gene of Tubian

304
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,340
Find this gene, it causes the result of this map change

305
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,840
We know that this gene is related to this function

306
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,840
So build it like this

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
know that if the gene is mutated

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
it causes some kind of disease

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
then we can ask

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then why does this disease occur?

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Except for this gene

312
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What other genes are also involved

313
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So in this way we will treat the disease

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Mechanism of healing

315
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
will have a more in-depth understanding

316
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Once we know the mechanism

317
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
why do you get sick

318
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Which genes are changed

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We can design some strategies to treat

320
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
you target a gene

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Design certain drugs against a certain protein

322
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
or drug screening

323
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So this is what fruit flies can use in

324
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The human disease we're going to talk about today

325
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Use above

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
then why fruit flies

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Just said it's cheap

328
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and it's fast

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
because you make a fruit fly

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you're only two weeks old

331
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
12 days

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,400
We can easily do several generations of genetic experiments

333
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,800
As long as you use a mouse, it will take a long time

334
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,200
As long as you use elephants, it will be even worse.

335
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,800
So just do a few things quickly

336
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,800
And after more than a hundred years of accumulation

337
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
have a lot of knowledge

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Presumably there isn't a single other multicellular organism

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,200
we know so much

340
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,000
Accumulated a lot of research resources

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Another very important thing is

342
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,800
The group of people who studied the fruit camp from the very beginning

343
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,800
It is the tradition established by the first big brother

344
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,400
makes everyone think

345
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Resource information for all research

346
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Should be to share is to share

347
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,800
that this is very important

348
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,800
This is actually why I chose to do fruit camp back then

349
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,800
Because at that time I wanted to say that I would go back to Taiwan in the future

350
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
that was nearly 30 years ago

351
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
we are very worried

352
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I am worried that if I return to Taiwan, I will be cut off from the world

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So as a fruit fly, I feel like I can get all this information

354
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I can get all the mutants from others

355
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Until now, the tradition of this community has been maintained like this.

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The third important thing is that fruit flies are actually very similar to people

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
About 75% of these genes cause disease in humans

358
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We can find it all in fruit flies

359
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So fruit flies can be used to study human disease

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We'll talk more about this later

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
One more thing I think is also very important is

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There are also single-celled organisms that are more convenient for us to study

363
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Siomyces bacterium

364
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's faster and cheaper for all the things just said

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But it's a little boring

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
it is not a multicellular organism

367
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Look at a Xiaomai fungus, it is round like that

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it looks boring

369
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,600
The various conditions it can have

370
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,100
Also different from us

371
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,400
But what about fruit flies?

372
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,200
Even its nervous system is similar to ours

373
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,900
it has various behaviors

374
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,700
are very close to people

375
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,300
so we can use it to study things that humans are interested in

376
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,400
it's simple enough and complex enough

377
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,700
So the complexity is just right

378
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:31,900
The study of the fruit fly began in 1910

379
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,600
I just said fruit flies are everywhere

380
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,700
So in early labs it was very easy for you to have fruit flies coming in from outside

381
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,600
Then just raise it and play it

382
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,400
Until 1910 this Thomas Hunt Morgan

383
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,500
He is at Columbia University

384
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,600
Then he started to find a fruit fly

385
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Fruit flies normally have red eyes

386
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,900
The one he found was white eyes

387
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,900
And this white-eyed fruit fly he mated it

388
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,760
I found out that white eyes are hereditary

389
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,720
And this white eye always follows the gender

390
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,200
it only appears in males

391
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,260
So we know it's a recessive mutation

392
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,300
Then it's sex-linked

393
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,960
It follows the sex chromosome X chromosome

394
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,960
So from here it published a paper a paper

395
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,060
that proves the gene

396
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,160
This was originally an abstract concept

397
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,760
gene it proves it's located on a chromosome

398
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,460
Chromosomes are things we can see under a microscope

399
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,160
So let's make this gene an entity

400
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,820
Then you can do research and experiment

401
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,960
So because of this study

402
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,920
it won the nobel prize in 1933

403
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,720
That early Drosophila research

404
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Found that Drosophila has this giant chromosome

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's just a chromosome its DNA replicates replicates replicates

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But it doesn't separate, unlike our normal chromosomes that will separate after duplication

407
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
it's all connected

408
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So it will replicate ten times. Two to the tenth power is a thousand times.

409
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
A thousand chromosomes, a thousand pieces of DNA glued together

410
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
so it becomes big

411
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
under the microscope when very large

412
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
At that time, only optical microscopes

413
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Under the microscope, you can see such a dark and light-colored

414
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
This type of pattern is fixed

415
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Every cell in every fruit fly is the same

416
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
so it can position it

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Sometimes such chromosomes will appear

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
There will be a sweep in the middle

419
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Because you can see the shape of the chromosome, you will know which section to scan

420
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
what kind of mutation

421
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You know that gene is located in this section

422
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So utilize a tool like this

423
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
twenty or thirty years

424
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
just did a lot of work

425
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Know the behavior of chromosomes

426
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
How chromosomes recombine

427
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
How come something missing these

428
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
How are the genes passed on?

429
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Then the location of the gene on the chromosome

430
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So about thirty years or so

431
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
just two things

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
is extremely important in genetics

433
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
one is fruit camp

434
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
one is corn

435
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
one animal one plant

436
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's all because their chromosomes are special

437
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So you can track chromosomal changes

438
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So this is Morgan

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
His Fly Group at Columbia University

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
very shabby one

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,960
Bananas hanging on a laboratory wall

442
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,800
Then there are glass jars with fruit flies

443
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,700
But such a laboratory

444
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,860
Dominate modern genetics for about 30 years

445
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,400
Then there's Morgan

446
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,860
Then Muller et al.

447
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,300
He also took the Norbell speech

448
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,360
Then the other two disciples of Morgan

449
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,800
Both Britjus and Sturdivus are masters of genetics

450
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,200
about 30 years

451
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:36,500
Genetics is fruit fly plus corn

452
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,100
That Morgan's students include this one

453
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,400
Herman Muller

454
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,300
He also made a lot of contributions

455
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,300
The most important thing is

456
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,200
He discovered that taking fruit flies and taking them to X-rays

457
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,600
will produce a mutation

458
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,200
X-rays break chromosomes

459
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,100
genetic changes

460
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,000
So this one is

461
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
is to tell us that radiation can damage our DNA

462
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,900
will cause mutation

463
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,600
Well, this was way before the atomic age.

464
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,200
But later it affected our consideration of this radiation.

465
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,000
The other is that you can artificially take X-rays

466
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,600
Later, I switched to taking some drugs to produce mutations

467
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,800
Mutation can be done for research

468
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
why is this important

469
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,600
Because Morgan when he found that one mutation

470
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,700
It just fell from the sky

471
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,700
the chances of that are very very low

472
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,000
then you take your luck doing research

473
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,700
But once you can artificially promote mutations

474
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,600
You have a much higher chance of getting the mutation

475
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
So it becomes very convenient

476
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,200
But the good times don't last long

477
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,100
it's the same tool

478
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
If you ask these questions to a certain level, you will not be able to continue asking them.

479
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
all done

480
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So to 1940 5060

481
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Drosophila becomes obsolete

482
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
has fallen to such an extent that almost no one is doing fruit flies anymore.

483
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Bacteria and viruses were the most popular at that time

484
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Do these genetic studies faster

485
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So a lot of people put in

486
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that ushered in a new era

487
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Fruit flies are eliminated

488
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It was 1970

489
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Only then did someone apply these new molecular biology techniques

490
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
brought it back and used it on fruit flies

491
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Because fruit flies have a very good knowledge in the past

492
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So he introduced this new technology

493
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
As a result, a lot of previous

494
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It is important to know that there is no way to study these issues

495
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Take it back for research

496
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The second golden age of the fruit fly

497
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
until now

498
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I should have said a moment ago

499
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
this chromosome

500
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
When I was in college, I told Wang Feichang

501
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I study botany

502
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
we'll have genetics

503
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Geneticists did genetic experiments

504
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
raising fruit flies

505
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and look at this giant chromosome under a microscope

506
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That fruit fly raised

507
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That food smells bad after fermentation

508
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
we have to wash the bottles

509
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Stinks

510
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I swore I would never touch a fruit fly again.

511
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Then look at this microscope

512
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
i get dizzy

513
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
because of the quick movement

514
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
will be dizzy

515
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I also swore never to touch a microscope again.

516
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's too early to say

517
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
As a result, later

518
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
will do it for decades

519
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Ok so I'm back to this fruit fly picture

520
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
here are some

521
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,200
these funny pictures

522
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,000
This is Wild Type

523
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,200
that's what we call normal

524
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,400
red eyes with wings

525
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,000
then have six legs

526
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
This is the first Baiyan Guoying I found

527
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,200
The pigment in his eyes is gone

528
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,700
Then the same gene can have different forms of pictures

529
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,100
This one is called White Apricot

530
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,500
his eyes are not so red

531
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,900
Pigment becomes lighter

532
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,100
Still a picture of the same gene

533
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,700
This fruit shadow with its wings rolled up is called Curly

534
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,400
This one has his body turned into Yellow

535
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,100
from black to yellow

536
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,700
It's also a matter of pigment

537
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,900
This one will be mentioned later

538
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,100
Called Illus and he has no eyes

539
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,200
He's all right, but his eyes are missing.

540
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,200
So earlier studies did a lot of this

541
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,000
image above form

542
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
We know that such mutations are related to development

543
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What about some other mutations?

544
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
he died

545
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Mutation occurs and he dies

546
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What can you do when you die?

547
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You told me that this gene is very important

548
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
so without him

549
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
what else to do

550
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Someone used it to study his death

551
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
when did he die

552
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
What happens to your body when you die?

553
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
You know he can develop to this stage

554
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Indicates that the gene is at this stage

555
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
before is not important

556
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Then at this stage it is important

557
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
so he can't go on

558
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
so you can know a lot

559
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Then you can also design various

560
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Interesting way to screen for mutations

561
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
For example, someone did a screening

562
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Because he really can fly

563
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
He put Guoruo in a cage

564
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Same network power

565
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
then go knock

566
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Those who can fly will fly up and hit the Internet

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
electrocuted

568
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,400
the flightless fruit camp

569
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
just survive

570
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
that won't fly

571
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,100
you can imagine it has several possibilities

572
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
one is that it may not have wings

573
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
so you can study wing development

574
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,500
one is that it has wings

575
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,900
but it can't fly

576
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,900
won't fly it may be because

577
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,700
Problems with the muscles that control flight

578
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,500
Or a problem with the nerves that control the flight

579
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,900
Or a problem with the control of the brain

580
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,700
So it can be divided into many more

581
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,500
So the same filter

582
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,100
you can find a variety of these mutations

583
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,800
So how to design this screening mutation

584
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,900
it's a very interesting place

585
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,900
Then as the years passed, we continued to

586
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
There are several important techniques

587
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,700
Then we can put the genes back in the fruit camp.

588
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,000
we can do whatever we want

589
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
want to control this gene

590
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
let it show where

591
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
what time to show

592
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,700
We can be inside a fruit eagle individual

593
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,100
Let some of its cells be damaged

594
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
some cells are good

595
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,400
So making this genetic fit

596
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Now we have new technology

597
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,100
let us do whatever we want

598
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,200
you don't rely on mutations

599
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
just happen naturally

600
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,700
But I just want to change this one gene

601
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,800
I change it like an engineer

602
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
So for Guoying

603
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,500
Now we can pretty much do whatever we want

604
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
in any particular cell

605
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,100
specific time

606
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,200
we can have a way to change

607
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,800
A certain gene its expression or its function

608
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,600
The precision of such manipulation

609
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,900
Can also be done in other creatures

610
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,600
But the precision is far less than

611
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
here

612
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,700
We can do the same in mice

613
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Of course it is much more expensive and much slower

614
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But the precision of manipulation

615
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
far inferior to fruit eagle

616
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Fruit eagle has many benefits

617
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Its genome was sequenced in 2000

618
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
this ordered paper

619
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
There are so many authors working together

620
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Not just the genetic sequencing of a fruit eagle

621
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Also did 12 different sequences

622
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
the total can be compared

623
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
If we take two total DNA sequences and compare

624
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
what they have in common

625
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
may be more important in evolution

626
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
so will be kept

627
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
they will change

628
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Probably something less important

629
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So this allows us to quickly

630
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
to focus on the important parts

631
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'll talk about it again

632
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
this development

633
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
Drosophila begins with a fertilized egg

634
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,100
just a cell

635
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,100
This cell divides many times

636
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,800
after the split

637
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,600
It's going to look like this when it's an embryo

638
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,700
You can see that this already has some body segments

639
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,400
it is divided into many body segments

640
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,000
That's a total of fourteen verses

641
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,400
The basic structure of an insect is the head

642
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,600
boobs then belly

643
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,000
The three parts of the head, chest and abdomen

644
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
what about the chest

645
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,600
Always three quarters

646
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
This is SORAC

647
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,500
So T1 T2 T3

648
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Each of the three sections grows a pair of legs

649
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Then the second section grows a wing

650
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,900
In the third section, a small wing will grow

651
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,200
called a balance bar

652
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,600
That abdomen has A1 to A8

653
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
eight knots

654
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
That

655
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,340
Abdomen no longer have legs

656
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,740
that such a heavy body structure

657
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,740
Actually

658
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,540
Black Fetus, Late and Larval Stages

659
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,540
can already see

660
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,240
so it's in a short time

661
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,340
somites

662
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,900
Let me show you one

663
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
Movie

664
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,340
Um

665
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Um

666
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,840
I just tried it and it still works

667
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,700
ok then

668
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,640
No way, I was going to show you this one

669
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,400
early developmental process

670
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,140
that same

671
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,300
You can tell it has these segments

672
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,040
someone made one

673
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
screening mutations

674
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and it finds this with all sorts of mutations

675
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
This dying embryo

676
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
dead in embryo

677
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
like this one

678
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
just compare with normal

679
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
it's like the body

680
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
this colored piece

681
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
all gone

682
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
so is this

683
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
All these colored parts are gone

684
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
gone here too

685
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So from the analysis of these mutant species

686
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The order in which they discovered

687
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
A very important structure like this comes out

688
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That is, the embryo must first determine the head and tail from the early stage

689
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Then through a series of genes

690
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Divide this embryo step by step into 14 somites

691
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
that part is very important

692
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But it's complicated

693
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
easy to bring

694
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Such research won a Nobel Prize

695
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,700
After it is divided into 14 body segments

696
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,300
grow into a mature individual

697
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,500
Each body segment has a different structure

698
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,000
I just talked about this T2

699
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
The second section of the chest will grow wings like this

700
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,100
What about the third part of the chest?

701
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,300
Such a small balance bar

702
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,100
Nothing grows in the first section of the chest

703
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,600
have a mutation in a gene

704
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
This gene is called UBX

705
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Just let this T3

706
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,100
The third section grows exactly like the second section

707
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,600
So what about a fruit fly?

708
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,600
Now there are two T2

709
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,600
there are two pairs of wings

710
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,600
that's very interesting

711
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,600
except this one looks like a monster

712
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
very interesting

713
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The change creates a difference between the two body segments

714
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
However, the two body segments are quite different in shape.

715
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So a genetic shift changes the past

716
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
another one

717
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
This is Guoying's head and this side is the secondary eye

718
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
this is the mouth

719
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and here are its tentacles

720
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
antennum

721
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Here's another mutation

722
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It makes this tentacles completely into feet

723
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
This is a very complete leg

724
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
The legs are divided into many knots

725
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So this one mutation is called antennanum pedia

726
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
pedia is feet

727
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Same it a gene change

728
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Make the original two forms above

729
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
very different structures

730
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
One tentacles and one foot transforms

731
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
say these two

732
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
The difference in the two body structures is only in the

733
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,820
a gene

734
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
So this gene controls

735
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,620
the development of a part of the body

736
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:13,860
The part of the embryo mentioned earlier

737
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,300
these two did it

738
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,660
And then the double-breasted fruit camp behind this

739
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,620
This Al-Louis did it

740
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,620
The three won the Nobel Prize together in 1995

741
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,300
Then you say OK this

742
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,920
You found the gene that controls fruit wing development

743
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,060
So what's so great

744
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,020
Right, man has no wings

745
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,720
What about in the fruit camp?

746
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,660
find a gene at the beginning

747
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,320
It was later discovered that there is actually a series of such genes

748
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,520
that and this set of genes is interesting

749
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,520
the order in which it is arranged on the chromosome

750
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,540
is consistent with the order in which they affect body parts

751
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,900
This one affects the development of the first tone

752
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,700
Then this will affect the development of the tail

753
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,900
come in order

754
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,600
Then such things exist in fruit flies

755
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,700
It is more interesting to find

756
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,800
It's not just fruit flies

757
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,800
Assuming only fruit flies exist, I won't talk about it today

758
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,600
Then it's because in mice and in people

759
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
in various creatures

760
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,000
have these genes

761
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,800
There is a group of fruit flies

762
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,400
In humans or mice there are four groups of these genes

763
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,100
Then they basically correspond like this

764
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,900
So basically if there are fruit flies, there are people too.

765
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,700
It's just that people are a little more complicated, a little more

766
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,200
Even more interesting is the order in which they are arranged

767
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,600
It's roughly the same order as the fruit fly

768
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,600
So it means that the order must be important

769
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,400
So why does this order matter until now?

770
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,700
Why is it left behind in evolution

771
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,000
Not very clear

772
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Diverse

773
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Then such a gene affects development in Drosophila

774
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Are there any rats?

775
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Then we see these genes

776
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Indicated here in different colors

777
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
where they appear on the body

778
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
that will affect

779
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
I just saw that fruit flies are body segments

780
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
segmental passage

781
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,500
So what kind of segmented structure do we humans have?

782
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The most obvious is our spine

783
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,500
The spine is divided into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, shoulder, and coccyx

784
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Every single one of these spines you take out to see

785
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,000
its shape is different

786
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
Especially the part of the thoracic spine

787
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
I still need to grow this rib

788
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,500
The different genes are called Hox genes

789
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,500
it manifests itself in this

790
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Different positions of the body from front to back

791
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
that this is different

792
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,400
It determines where you grew up

793
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
what kind of vertebra

794
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,200
we watch mice

795
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,600
This cervical vertebra of the mouse is here

796
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,000
There are seven vertebrae

797
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
What about chickens? There are so many cervical vertebrae.

798
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
about a dozen sections

799
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,200
Then he has less thoracic spine

800
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,200
And this mouse has more thoracic vertebrae

801
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,200
The demarcation points of these cervical and thoracic vertebrae

802
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,200
These are the Hawks genes just mentioned

803
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
expressive boundaries

804
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,200
So these boundaries the range they represent

805
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,200
It determines what kind of bone will grow in this position

806
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Another place is

807
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,200
This is also Hawks content

808
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,660
13 or 11

809
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,160
Then if under normal conditions

810
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,500
This is the metacarpal bone of a mouse

811
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,300
dye here

812
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,000
This red is dyed cartilage

813
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
blue stained bones

814
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,660
If this gene is broken

815
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,660
Its development is slightly different

816
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,160
If both genes are broken

817
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,660
it becomes like this

818
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,820
It just doesn't grow the bones at the far end.

819
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,820
Mutation of another gene on mating

820
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,820
This is another one called Glycery

821
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,320
If there is something wrong with this gene

822
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
look at this time

823
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,820
fingers become more than five

824
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,820
it has about seven to eight here

825
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,820
Then if both genes are completely destroyed

826
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,820
it has thirteen fingers

827
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,980
And it's not as long as the front

828
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
None of the remote

829
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,000
So these genes affect the development of many different parts of our body

830
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Let me talk about the eyes again

831
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Then the facts of my own experiments study this eye

832
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This is restudy

833
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
very beautiful very regular

834
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
This was filmed with a wire

835
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This is an optical microscope

836
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Taken by Jiebo Microscope

837
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
normal it is red

838
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
this one is a mutant it's white

839
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Because the arrangement of this eye is very regular

840
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
so any small change

841
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
you can easily detect

842
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So this is a

843
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
you see this and you think

844
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the surface is very rough

845
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
irregular

846
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
This is also a mutation

847
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This is another mutation

848
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
The whole eye is gone

849
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Then there is another mutation

850
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
his eyes got small

851
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
and small he is

852
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
from top to bottom like this

853
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Straight

854
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So just look at the type

855
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
we can see

856
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Various can affect the eyes

857
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
developmental mutations

858
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Then you can do it from here

859
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
a lot of analysis

860
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I think the funniest thing is

861
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
this one mutation

862
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
just said Eilus

863
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Then he mutated and the whole eye disappeared.

864
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So this means

865
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
This gene is

866
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Necessary for secondary actor development

867
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
If his eyes are broken, they won't grow back

868
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that's more interesting

869
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
If this gene

870
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
bring him to show on the wings

871
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
or on the head

872
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
he can be on the wings

873
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
on the legs

874
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,600
On the legs, and then on this antennae, there are eyes

875
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,100
So without him, the eyes can't grow

876
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,800
Then you show him in that place

877
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,400
Just grow an eye

878
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,000
So this gene determines

879
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,000
Do you want to develop into eyes?

880
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,400
decide his fate

881
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,600
Then this experiment is a Swiss

882
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,000
A Water Garing made in his laboratory

883
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,500
Then you see the eyes are very beautiful

884
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:43,500
Then the same if this gene directly affects the effect

885
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,800
i won't talk here

886
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,900
The same gene exists in both mice and humans

887
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,700
In mice, this gene mutation is called small eyes.

888
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,900
His eyes became smaller

889
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,400
this is normal

890
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,000
What about human genes?

891
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,500
He doesn't have red membranes in his eyes

892
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
The man, the mouse and the fly, this gene

893
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,300
are very similar in structure

894
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,800
So if this gene

895
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,000
It controls the development of the eyes

896
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,200
Some people say that this is called a master gene

897
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,000
it is master

898
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,000
Then he decides whether the eyes should develop or not

899
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,000
That other study said

900
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,500
It takes about 2,500 genes to make an eye

901
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,500
There is a very complicated process

902
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,000
So we can imagine saying

903
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This I-LUS this gene

904
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,500
it is a switch

905
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
it turns on the whole

906
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
a program of reenactment of development

907
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
a program

908
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,000
Well, someone did an experiment like this

909
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,000
he put human genes

910
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I just said that it is very similar to the genes of fruit flies

911
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,460
It is used in fruit ants to express

912
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,160
Do exactly the same experiment as the fruit ants.

913
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,160
what do you think will happen

914
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it turns out

915
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,000
Human genes are put in

916
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,760
put it in fruit ants

917
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,000
can still produce an eye

918
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,500
So the resulting eyes are the eyes of fruit ants

919
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,660
or human eyes

920
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
What we put in is this switch

921
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,500
it opens the city behind

922
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,800
The whole city is still a city of fruit ants

923
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,700
So it grows out as the secondary eye of fruit ants

924
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
This is very interesting, it means

925
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It's been so long since evolution

926
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The original switch is still in use

927
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Obviously this switch is very important, it cannot be changed randomly

928
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So from fruit flies to people

929
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Someone pushes it further to simpler organisms

930
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
This gene was also found

931
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Some even push it all the way to single-celled organisms

932
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
we won't talk about that

933
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Anyway, there's a gene that matters

934
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Then as long as you let this gene express

935
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
it makes an eye

936
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That power is a bit too much

937
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
In case it accidentally behaves wrong

938
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
expressed in a cell

939
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That one cell becomes the eye

940
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
then we should

941
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Inexplicably, there are some places with eyes

942
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
but it didn't happen

943
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So our laboratory has done such an experiment

944
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,500
is that we found such a gene

945
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,000
It actually manifests in the embryo

946
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
The location is not just where the eyes are

947
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
it behaves elsewhere

948
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Apparently in those places it doesn't cause eyes

949
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So it's not that it's that powerful

950
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
In addition we can also in this

951
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,000
On this tissue that will develop into wings in the future

952
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
performance, for example, in such a circle

953
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It is only at this point that the cells of the eye are produced

954
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So it doesn't spawn eyes everywhere

955
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Then such research can be said later

956
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Then it must cooperate with other factors.

957
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
The one it wants to cooperate with only appears in this place

958
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So it's only in that place that it can produce eyes

959
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So this follow-up

960
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,500
did a series of studies like this

961
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,000
one of his collaborators

962
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It was our lab that found this gene called Igon

963
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
As the name suggests, this gene is also broken.

964
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The eyes are gone, just gone

965
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So he is very similar to Iless

966
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,500
Let's find out his genes

967
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
It is found that the structure is also very similar

968
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,500
But the two do different things

969
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,500
Express the Iless gene in places other than the eyes

970
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,500
he will have eyes

971
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,500
But expressing the Igon gene in the body

972
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,500
He is still only next to the eyes

973
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
can produce eyes

974
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,500
But it doesn't work anywhere other than the eyes

975
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,500
So he doesn't decide the fate of the eyes

976
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,500
This one decides the fate of the eyes

977
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
But we want to add the two together

978
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
I saw that every extra eye grew very big at this time

979
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Then our experiments found that

980
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
It turns out that the Eros gene controls developmental destiny

981
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Naegon, the gene that controls cell division

982
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So if you want to generate eyes in this place

983
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It has very few cells, so it grows very small

984
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But adding this one can increase the number of compound eye cells

985
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
so the eyes get bigger

986
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So normally both genes need

987
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
to produce a true compound eye

988
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
From these studies of the eyes, we can also see

989
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
There are various mutations that affect eye size

990
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
The normal eyes here just now are so big

991
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Some mutations make the eyes smaller

992
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
more serious eye disappears

993
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So this is to make the eyes smaller

994
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
There is another direction to make the eyes bigger

995
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
At this time, the eyes become a little swollen

996
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
That's more serious and it becomes like this

997
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
so it wrinkled

998
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
because it has too many cells

999
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Then you can't become such a big

1000
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
so it folds up

1001
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So that's a lot like cancer

1002
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
grow a tumor

1003
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
So some people use fruit flies to study cancer

1004
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Some people say that cancer has been studied for decades

1005
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So now you join in the research with fruit flies.

1006
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Any chance of finding something new?

1007
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
it did find

1008
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
that's normal

1009
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
This is a mutation found

1010
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,600
it overproliferates this cell

1011
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
The growth area is very large

1012
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,600
so wrinkled like this

1013
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,400
This wrinkled look is a bit like a Shar Pei

1014
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,200
basically an increase in surface area

1015
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,700
your body hasn't changed

1016
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,200
So it just has to fold the skin

1017
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,200
Shar Pei

1018
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,200
So this gene was originally called

1019
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,800
Shopey Sharpei

1020
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:28,100
Later, it was named earlier because of another person.

1021
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,700
So it's called Sovodor

1022
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,300
This series of genes

1023
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,900
Then I found out how they work

1024
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,400
transmission of such a signal

1025
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
from cell surface

1026
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,000
And then all the way to the cell river

1027
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,400
control gene expression

1028
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,200
such a signaling chain

1029
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,200
hyperactivation

1030
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,200
will produce such a situation

1031
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,900
it's a normal

1032
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
A piece of tissue will develop into a wing in the future

1033
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
If this HIPPO is excessive, it will become like this

1034
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
grow very big

1035
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Such a PASSWARE was first found in Drosophila

1036
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Then it was discovered that in the rat people there are

1037
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:26,000
In experiments with mice

1038
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
If you overactivate this PASSWARE

1039
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
The whole liver becomes so big

1040
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Then in this signal transmission chain

1041
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
There is a gene that is Selvador, Sarpy mentioned here

1042
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Another gene is called HIPPO

1043
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
that's what makes this organization big

1044
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
just like homer

1045
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So this HIPPO PASSWARE was the first to be found in fruit flies

1046
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
In the past in human cancer research

1047
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
did not find this one

1048
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Then this password is very important

1049
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Because cancer takes a tumor to grow

1050
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
He wants cell division

1051
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
he will grow a lot

1052
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Then our body has some mechanism

1053
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
you split too much

1054
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
i'm going to kill you

1055
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
So the cell kills itself

1056
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
After such a password is activated

1057
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
On the one hand, he makes the cells divide more

1058
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
On the one hand, keep him from dying

1059
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So the one who was supposed to die didn't die

1060
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So many and not dead

1061
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Then it becomes like this

1062
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
so this is a

1063
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
used to study cancer is now a very important part

1064
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
that could do more cancer research

1065
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's cancer, usually you have a tumor

1066
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
The tumor itself is usually not fatal

1067
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
We can see news reports that

1068
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
A certain person has a 20-kilometer

1069
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
It can also walk around with this 20 kilograms and live for a long time

1070
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
fine

1071
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Unless the tumor just presses on your blood vessels or nerves

1072
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
you will have problems

1073
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
What about the most common and deadly cause of cancer?

1074
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
is it shifted

1075
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
It's not just a tumor

1076
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Instead, it travels to all parts of the body

1077
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Attack more now

1078
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
that's more serious

1079
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Therefore, a very important aspect of our research on cancer is

1080
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Inhibition of asking how this transfer occurred and what it looked like

1081
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So someone did this beautiful experiment

1082
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
it puts part of the cells

1083
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
make it express a cancer-causing gene

1084
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
This is called RES

1085
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
After the performance, this small piece of tissue will proliferate a lot

1086
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
grow up like this

1087
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
This kind of organization we call it

1088
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
and make it express a green fluorescent protein

1089
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
so you can see this piece

1090
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,160
It's bright green and grows a lot

1091
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,160
but it won't run around

1092
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,600
it stops here

1093
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,200
So this is a normal tumor

1094
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,900
use such a basis

1095
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,500
Then look for any genetic mutations

1096
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,500
Let this one tumor start running around now

1097
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,500
start transfer

1098
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,300
For example, a new mutation is found here

1099
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,100
It will make this group now run to other parts of the body

1100
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:39,800
Take out this piece of cells that will transfer

1101
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,600
Transplanted into another fly

1102
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,100
found that it would continue to run around

1103
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,800
So start this way

1104
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,600
so we can find out which genes affect cancer cells

1105
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,800
Will it transfer

1106
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,100
And then you can even screen for drugs

1107
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Another one is related to cancer.

1108
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
This is also a very unexpected thing that happened in basic research

1109
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,000
He found that if we put such a real organization

1110
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
This piece will grow into wings in the future

1111
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
go and x-ray it

1112
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Then do some damage, some cells will die

1113
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
So these cells with red dots and red dots have changed

1114
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
will die

1115
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
So after a while this gets smaller

1116
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
because those cells die

1117
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
then you give it time

1118
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
it will grow back to its normal size

1119
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
it makes up for it completely

1120
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So this is our body's normal repair of external damage

1121
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
What's interesting is that if in an experiment like this

1122
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I'll take an X-ray of it

1123
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
the green half

1124
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I express a gene to

1125
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
make those damn cells

1126
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
won't die now

1127
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So some

1128
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
damn cell

1129
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It turns out that this group of cells

1130
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Blooming now

1131
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
become a large tumor

1132
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
then from here

1133
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
derived a series of studies

1134
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
the dead cell

1135
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
dying cells

1136
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
it will send out a signal

1137
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
tell the next cell to say

1138
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
I'm going to say goodbye

1139
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
make it up to me

1140
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So there is an empty

1141
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So you split up to make up for me

1142
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Then if this group of cells is now

1143
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
damn it

1144
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
you let it stay there

1145
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
It continues to play such a signal

1146
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So the cells next to it have a lot of rope

1147
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Then tell the side

1148
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,760
when we say we cure cancer

1149
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,560
Usually you give me a medicine

1150
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,460
kill that cancer cell

1151
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,600
the cells that kill

1152
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,200
if not quickly drained

1153
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,760
it actually sends a signal

1154
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,160
Let the next cell grow again

1155
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,960
so you kill the cells

1156
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,200
There are supplements on the side

1157
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,360
So that cancer becomes unkillable

1158
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,960
So this becomes saying now

1159
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,360
cancer treatment considerations

1160
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,960
a very important thing

1161
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So you see although fruit flies look

1162
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,160
so small

1163
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,400
But only on the matter of cancer

1164
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,560
It has many important new contributions

1165
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,760
the other one

1166
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,360
let everyone know

1167
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,000
A hot topic is stem cells

1168
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,200
stem cell is a cell

1169
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,800
then it will split

1170
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,600
become two cells

1171
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,960
these two cells

1172
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,120
these two cells

1173
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,400
One of them will differentiate into other cells in the future

1174
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,900
The other one is himself

1175
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,400
so he split forever

1176
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,200
He made himself up again

1177
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,800
so I will never change

1178
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,000
He keeps producing new cells to differentiate out

1179
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,800
This ability to self-renew is stem cells

1180
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,300
Stem cells often just sit there

1181
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,400
when we come of age

1182
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,100
Stem Cells Might Stop Over There

1183
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,300
when you need it

1184
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,300
it split

1185
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,000
In studies of fruit flies, it was found that

1186
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,700
Stem cells are influenced by the environment next to them

1187
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,800
This is the stem cell

1188
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,400
it has some cells next to it

1189
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:51,200
It will be controlled by certain signals

1190
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,300
Then once the stem cell divides

1191
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,700
This stem cell is out of this environment

1192
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,760
it is not controlled so it differentiates

1193
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:07,200
It can't be differentiated if it's always connected here

1194
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,800
so it maintains the stem cells

1195
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
So there are many experiments telling us that

1196
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,100
This Nich is called a seat

1197
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,300
It is a microenvironment

1198
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,700
a small environment

1199
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,400
this seat is important

1200
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,200
The size of the seat determines how many stem cells

1201
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,400
can stay here

1202
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,400
Seats got smaller

1203
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,600
or as you get older

1204
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,800
This Nich might get smaller and older

1205
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,200
Its ability to maintain stem cells becomes worse

1206
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,400
so we reach old age

1207
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,400
Our stem cells also get worse

1208
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,000
So this seat it can control stem cells of trees

1209
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,800
it controls aging

1210
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,000
stay here and go out

1211
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
to form an appropriate proportion

1212
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,700
it goes out too much

1213
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,200
Your stem cells haven't stayed here yet

1214
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,900
it also becomes differentiated

1215
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,700
it reduces the number of stem cells

1216
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,500
so these are very important

1217
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:19,000
Then this microenvironment will affect stem cells

1218
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,600
this nitch

1219
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,600
It was also first discovered in Drosophila

1220
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:31,600
Then some people use fruit flies to study immunity

1221
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,600
It puts fruit flies on it and puts some of this needle fungus

1222
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,600
Then this needle fungus will infect fruit flies

1223
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,600
then grow very fast

1224
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Like this fruit fly, its immune system has problems

1225
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,600
So it gets eaten quickly by the needle fungus

1226
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,600
So the same from here

1227
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,600
You can then screen for mutations

1228
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,600
There is no resistance to needle bacterial infection

1229
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,600
or super resistant

1230
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,240
Then a series of genes were found

1231
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,840
What's interesting about this set of genes?

1232
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,640
It was later discovered that there are also

1233
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,360
So this series of human grapes

1234
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,360
very close to fruit flies

1235
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,800
So let's do some research with fruit flies

1236
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,840
So because of this study this

1237
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,600
Jules Hoffman in 2011

1238
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,000
He won the Nobel Prize with two others

1239
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,800
It's also about disease

1240
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,520
it's this fruit fly

1241
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,920
This fruit fly was the first mutation found

1242
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,720
Then it's called Windless

1243
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,880
just no wings

1244
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,160
It has such a mutation that both wings are missing

1245
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,680
some are missing a wing

1246
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,320
like this one it's this side

1247
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,320
The wings on this side are missing

1248
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,840
The first gene was later studied a lot

1249
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:09,340
It plays an important role in all stages of development

1250
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,540
He discovered that this gene is called Windless in the fruit camp

1251
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,340
It is found in people that it is called Int1

1252
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,500
is an early study of cancer that found one

1253
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,140
genes associated with viruses

1254
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:29,340
So this gene was later called Wint

1255
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,680
Take this W and NT

1256
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:38,880
This Wint Passway is very close to the fruit camp and people

1257
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:43,980
It was later discovered that he developed with various

1258
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,140
All kinds of diseases are related

1259
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,080
So you can even make a book

1260
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:53,380
It is Winds Signaling in development and disease

1261
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:57,380
There are many similar

1262
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,380
I found it from the fruit camp

1263
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,400
an interesting mutation

1264
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,160
Affects certain developmental processes

1265
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,880
It was later discovered that the matter involved

1266
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,400
his role

1267
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,440
are very much related to human diseases.

1268
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,240
Another one I saw recently

1269
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,880
Someone did such an experiment

1270
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,280
Studying Diabetes Using Drosophila

1271
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,760
obesity

1272
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,000
heart disease

1273
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,280
He gave fruit flies this high-fat diet

1274
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,000
fruit flies become fat

1275
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,440
a lot of fat accumulation

1276
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,840
this accumulation

1277
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,360
Not only in his fat tissue

1278
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,920
will also accumulate to other organizations

1279
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,040
just like people

1280
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,000
In this example inside

1281
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,640
he will accumulate to the heart

1282
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,640
Then the heart accumulates too much fat

1283
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,520
there will be some diseases

1284
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,800
this lesion

1285
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,200
like human heart disease

1286
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,640
a certain kind of like

1287
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,240
So you can also use this

1288
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,000
to study some of the heart disease

1289
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,000
so he can find some genes

1290
01:05:59,280 --> 01:05:59,920
will go

1291
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
affect the process

1292
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,400
In the last period of time, I will talk about this brain

1293
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,400
We can use fruit flies to study brain function

1294
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,600
this is the first one

1295
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,400
Also a professor at Caltech

1296
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,600
Seymour Banser

1297
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:27,600
He was an important figure in early molecular biology

1298
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,200
he was born a physicist

1299
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,900
Then he went to study the virus

1300
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,200
That's a great contribution to molecular biology

1301
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,400
Then to class 1960

1302
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,000
He just said it's done

1303
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,300
Important questions are done

1304
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,900
so he's looking for something new to do

1305
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,900
So he said I'm going to use fruit flies to study neurons

1306
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,500
What about the nervous system of the fruit fly?

1307
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,800
This is our human brain

1308
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,600
There are about 10 to 11 times that nerve cells

1309
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,100
A mouse has 10 brains

1310
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
There are 10 to the 8th power

1311
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
That's all the brains of fruit flies

1312
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
There are 10 to the 5th power

1313
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
There is also a nematode

1314
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Proportionally above

1315
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You can't see that point at all

1316
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
The nematode has 302 nerve cells

1317
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
very precise

1318
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Nematodes are a very special research material

1319
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
we know it very, very well

1320
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
but too simple

1321
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So fruit flies have 10 to the power of 5 neurons

1322
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Compared to humans and mice

1323
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
this is smaller

1324
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Then it is better to study

1325
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Then wait a minute to show everyone

1326
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Its behavior is quite complicated

1327
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So SIMO BANZER started

1328
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
He said I came to find the mutation

1329
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
What mutations affect neurological function

1330
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Then he did a lot of different screening

1331
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
This one is a biological clock

1332
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,460
It puts fruit flies in a tiny tube

1333
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,160
This fruit fly will walk around

1334
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,760
It has an infrared Motion Detector

1335
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,460
to detect whether the fruit fly has holes

1336
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,500
So a hole here is a black spot

1337
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,500
This sidewalk is time

1338
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,500
so you just watch

1339
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,800
From this line above

1340
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,160
Been going down this fruit fly for a while

1341
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,500
been in the hole

1342
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,360
then for a while

1343
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,960
almost banned

1344
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,120
hole again for a while

1345
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:38,120
From this cycle is about 24 hours

1346
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,620
So fruit flies have a parity clock of almost 24 hours

1347
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:46,460
Almost half of the 24 hours it was in the hole

1348
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,120
half of it is sleeping

1349
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:52,960
Using this letter, it will do the screening

1350
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,960
Then we got three mutants

1351
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,200
The first is the Wu cycle

1352
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,200
It can move at any time of the day

1353
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,700
The other one is a short period of 19 hours

1354
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,700
Then one is a long period of 28 hours

1355
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:15,500
Then the last three mutations were found to be the same gene

1356
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,200
that its a different mutation

1357
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,800
So the same gene, this gene is called period or per

1358
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:27,200
From here, there are many people looking for

1359
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,100
These genes affect the biological clock

1360
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,400
Then finally find a complex regulation like this

1361
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,500
Then such regulation in mice and humans

1362
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,400
Actually very close

1363
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:44,800
it's basically a negative feedback

1364
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,900
It's just my things are slowly increasing

1365
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,800
After increasing it inhibits its own generation

1366
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:51,900
it goes down

1367
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,700
down to a degree

1368
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,700
it has no way to suppress its own generation

1369
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,800
it grows again, it grows again

1370
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,000
so there is a cycle

1371
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
This cycle is about 24 hours

1372
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So now I know quite a lot about such a process.

1373
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Our cycles are regulated by light

1374
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,000
There is also light that will pass through a certain photosensitive rate of fire

1375
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Then affect this passage

1376
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Similar to just now, some people also use that method to study the sleep of Guoying.

1377
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:38,000
it has different activities and sleep times

1378
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Various mutants can also be found

1379
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
From here you can find some genetic influences

1380
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Then know where these genes act in the brain

1381
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So if this goes wrong you won't be able to sleep

1382
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,240
so start here

1383
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,840
Just ask Deputy Wang

1384
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,840
how do we adjust the time difference

1385
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,240
you sleep disorder

1386
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,840
how to treat

1387
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,560
Start here with some

1388
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,560
have some help with this

1389
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:22,960
Then someone used fruit flies to learn and remember

1390
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,120
Don't think fruit flies are stupid

1391
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,880
actually it's not bad

1392
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,680
That's the first experiment

1393
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,680
it smells to fruit flies

1394
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,680
you have two flavors

1395
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,680
You give it a smell first

1396
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,680
then give it an electric shock

1397
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,680
inside this pipe

1398
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:41,680
you put fruit flies in

1399
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,680
Then the outside of the pipe is the same way

1400
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,680
so you give it flavor on the one hand

1401
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,680
give it an electric shock

1402
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,680
after those few times

1403
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,680
it learns

1404
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,680
It combines this taste with

1405
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,680
Will be linked together by electricity

1406
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,680
then you put it

1407
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,680
From this electric tube

1408
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,640
move to another tube

1409
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,840
Then give him two flavors to choose

1410
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,600
Two flavors one A and one B

1411
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,600
He knows that A will be electrocuted

1412
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,200
He ran towards B

1413
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,840
so he can learn

1414
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,240
and he still has memory

1415
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,840
because you can live for hours

1416
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,200
Come back in a few days

1417
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,640
His memory will slowly fade

1418
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,040
so he remembers

1419
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,040
can be found here

1420
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,200
Many mutants can affect this memory

1421
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,400
Then know these genes

1422
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,800
then probably know

1423
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,360
this sequence of their actions

1424
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:43,840
Sure enough, there are other studies

1425
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,200
the study of other organisms

1426
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,960
We can now take this memory

1427
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,000
into several stages

1428
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,000
have short term memory

1429
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,160
mid-term memory

1430
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,200
long term memory

1431
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,760
Another memory is anti-anesthesia

1432
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,920
there are some memories

1433
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
If something happens, then you anesthetize him

1434
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
When he wakes up he doesn't remember that

1435
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Because after the incident he needed to go

1436
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
save him

1437
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
If you were anesthetized for a period of time

1438
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
He can't save it, that memory is lost

1439
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So there are these different stages

1440
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
There are many studies to distinguish those different stages

1441
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
including different mutants

1442
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Each affects memory at different stages

1443
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So this way we can differentiate it

1444
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That's the distinction we'll probably know by now

1445
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
at the location of this nerve cell connection

1446
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
what kind of changes happened

1447
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
The mechanism of this basic memory

1448
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
after some understanding

1449
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
someone to develop

1450
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Is there any medicine that can enhance memory

1451
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It is also said that many genetic

1452
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,600
sexual intellectual disability

1453
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,400
Those genes are now identified

1454
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,200
Discovery is related to these

1455
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,800
So it might also be possible to use

1456
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,500
Solve some problems of mental retardation

1457
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,200
We now know a lot about the brain

1458
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,500
So in a causal brain

1459
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,000
We know that memory passes through this organization

1460
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,900
This is called a mushroom body

1461
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,800
It's this red and green

1462
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:32,800
So it seems like the mushroom has one sticking out like this

1463
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,200
Then it can be divided into many cells

1464
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,700
We roughly know which cells are in which stage of memory

1465
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,200
what role to play

1466
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,300
Academician Jiang Anshi of Tsinghua University

1467
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,600
he did some experiments

1468
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,100
he said long term memory

1469
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,100
There are two cells here that are very important

1470
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,600
The fake two cells don't work

1471
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,800
Your long-term memory won't be able to form

1472
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,200
So we now have a function of these neurons

1473
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,000
Can know very, very finely

1474
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,200
Another interesting thing is

1475
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,300
Drosophila's Wine Book

1476
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,200
Someone made a design like this

1477
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,700
He took many funnels and stacked them together

1478
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,200
Then pass the alcohol vapor through

1479
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,300
put fruit flies on it

1480
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,300
fruit fly trap drunk

1481
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,100
he just fell

1482
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,300
If you are not drunk at all

1483
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,900
He is standing on top of the drunk

1484
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,700
if a little drunk

1485
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,700
He just dropped one floor, two floors

1486
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,200
So you just see how many layers he dropped

1487
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,000
You can tell how drunk he is

1488
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,700
So there is a very bright observation

1489
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,600
The same can be used to screen for mutant species

1490
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,000
that also said

1491
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,900
This looks like a wine book

1492
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,300
Just give him a long tube and let him go

1493
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,600
That also passes through alcohol vapour.

1494
01:15:58,800 --> 01:15:59,700
then you use

1495
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,260
this camera to take pictures

1496
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:05,760
You can analyze whether its steps are messed up

1497
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,760
can you walk in a straight line

1498
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,860
Then here is to see if alcohol is addictive

1499
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:17,500
It fills the capillary with water

1500
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,660
there is plenty of water

1501
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:21,800
some water plus alcohol

1502
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,000
Then you can choose

1503
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,560
Then it puts a different salt

1504
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,600
So one is blue and one is red

1505
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,600
You just eat it last and look inside its stomach

1506
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
more blue or more red

1507
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,800
you know which one it likes

1508
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,900
Let's see if it's addictive to alcohol

1509
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,100
There is an interesting experiment that says that

1510
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:46,000
If the public courtship is rejected,

1511
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,000
then it will drink

1512
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,500
There are two students from Hsinchu Experimental Middle School

1513
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,100
Come to me for an experiment

1514
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,400
he does that

1515
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
they repeat that experiment

1516
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Turns out they didn't quite

1517
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
After being denied state leave

1518
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
at first he was very depressed

1519
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
he doesn't drink anything

1520
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
But if at this time he still drinks occasionally

1521
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
After he drank alcohol

1522
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
he started to like

1523
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
So there are two stages

1524
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
start with frustration

1525
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
and then a sobriety

1526
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Such research is very important

1527
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
because all over the world

1528
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
especially alcohol or drug addiction in the United States

1529
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
is very serious

1530
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So you can use this to do research

1531
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
The state also has neurodegeneration

1532
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So there are a lot of mutants

1533
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
he has these holes in his brain

1534
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Similar to our neurodegeneration

1535
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
So these genes are now being identified one by one

1536
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
this is a normal brain

1537
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
we can also put him

1538
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Take some of these genes that are already known to cause neurodegeneration in humans

1539
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Take it and put it in the fruit fly to express

1540
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So you see this is a normal fruit fly

1541
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
This is if a human disease-causing gene is put into it

1542
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
has become like this

1543
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,000
It's basically a lot of cells dying

1544
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So the red pigment is gone

1545
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And then there are these plaques left by dead cells

1546
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
When you see eyes like this, they become very small

1547
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
most cells die

1548
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
So from here we can study neurodegeneration

1549
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
There is also a type of picture that is very similar to our epilepsy

1550
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
These pictures are very interesting

1551
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
It's called BandSensitive like this

1552
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
This is called Knockdown

1553
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
This picture is usually fine

1554
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
You hit its tube hard on the table

1555
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
it just falls down

1556
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Some will start to draw like this

1557
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
So just like our point display

1558
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
then it's been a while

1559
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
it will slowly recover

1560
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
in the process

1561
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
This sequence is similar to the onset of human dots

1562
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
The process seems to be very similar

1563
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,000
So this set of these genes

1564
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Many people are now researching

1565
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Sure enough, the names of these genes are very interesting.

1566
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
You see this is called Knockdown

1567
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
This is called Eastly Shot

1568
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
easily scared

1569
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
This is Technical Knockout

1570
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It's a technical knockout in boxing

1571
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
This is called Couch Potato

1572
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
it just sits there

1573
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Different kinds

1574
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Then our current research on the brain

1575
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
very very fine

1576
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,200
Then it can be in this brain

1577
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,500
ten to the power of five cells

1578
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:10,200
It turns only one of the cells green at a time

1579
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,300
it can draw its this position

1580
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,500
where are these extensions of it

1581
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,800
Then it made tens of thousands of

1582
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,700
Hundreds of thousands of such samples

1583
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:25,800
The accumulation wants to know the whole brain

1584
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,500
The relative position of each cell

1585
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:34,000
So this is something we'll know soon

1586
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,500
The structure of the whole brain of Drosophila

1587
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,500
Then we know the structure of these nerve cells

1588
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,500
to go one step further and try to control it

1589
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,500
So someone developed this called

1590
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,500
Optogenetics

1591
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,500
it's inside certain nerve cells

1592
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:55,500
Express some special genes

1593
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,000
This gene responds to light

1594
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,700
so we use a different light

1595
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:06,540
can turn off or activate this neuron

1596
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,540
So you can do something like this in the fruit camp

1597
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,040
This is also an experiment in Jiaen Temple

1598
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,240
its under the microscope

1599
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,740
This has a plate inside and two nuts

1600
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,200
it uses lasers to track

1601
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,900
have this camera

1602
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,300
so it can track every fruit

1603
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:35,000
the direction it goes

1604
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,600
Which foot lifts up

1605
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,200
which wing move

1606
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,900
Everything can be analyzed

1607
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,700
Then the following may not be able to put

1608
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,100
it's here

1609
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,200
come back

1610
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:07,700
It's two fruit flies, a bee, and a gnat

1611
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,500
The bee will chase the bee

1612
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,300
This is normal courtship behavior

1613
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:17,700
It makes the bee close to a certain distance from the bee

1614
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,200
just give it a pad

1615
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,700
It's not a pad it's a light burn it

1616
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:27,900
Burned, this laser burns fruit flies will hurt

1617
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:35,400
So it will learn that it can't get close to this fruit fly

1618
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:39,100
look here it will light up

1619
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,200
it's too close so light up

1620
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,400
it goes away

1621
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,400
light up again

1622
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,400
you see it and run away

1623
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,700
After training like this for a while

1624
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,400
you come to test again

1625
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,240
Didn't pad him one female and one male

1626
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,100
If the mother gets close to him, he will run away

1627
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,100
look at

1628
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,940
so this

1629
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:21,200
The duke will learn and you can train him

1630
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:26,200
He knew that it would not work if he got close to a certain distance.

1631
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,700
he will be burned

1632
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,400
In that case, we can use this system to ask

1633
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:37,200
So which nerve cell is related to this matter?

1634
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:42,300
So you can decide what kind of neural circuit

1635
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:44,800
to control such behavior

1636
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,800
That's probably the last example

1637
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,300
This is state-run and can also be used to study long pets

1638
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,400
There is only one state run called Mesucela

1639
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,000
this is a

1640
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
This is a normal fruit fly

1641
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
this is its lifespan

1642
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
cross elbow is time

1643
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
number of days

1644
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Then how much is the vertical elbow alive?

1645
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
So it's 100% from the beginning

1646
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Then slowly some die

1647
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
eighty days

1648
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
just die

1649
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
this is normal

1650
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
What about the Messerlada fruit fly

1651
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
eighty days

1652
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
more than half of it is still alive

1653
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
that most often survives

1654
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
more than one hundred days

1655
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
So why is it called Messerlada?

1656
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
because this is

1657
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
oldest person in the bible

1658
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
tell him to live

1659
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Nine hundred and sixty-nine years old

1660
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
just make an appointment

1661
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
at that time

1662
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I don't know if it's exactly the same year as we are now

1663
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
anyway it's documented

1664
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
think the oldest

1665
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So this one is called Messerlada

1666
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
that's very interesting

1667
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
it lives long

1668
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
But

1669
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
and at the same time

1670
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
It's an anti-tumor drug

1671
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,500
then it works against muscle

1672
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,000
it can withstand high temperature

1673
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So these resistance to stress are related to longevity

1674
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
there is an important point here

1675
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It's a broken gene

1676
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
This picture is to make this gene broken

1677
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
As a result it grows longer

1678
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,000
This means that the normal function of this gene

1679
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
to keep you from living so long

1680
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
So tell us about the design of this creature

1681
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:41,000
You may have passed a useful point in evolution

1682
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
you should not go on living

1683
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So it has a genetic design

1684
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
just let you die

1685
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Then let's go back and destroy that gene

1686
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You can live longer as a result

1687
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And it doesn't just live long

1688
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
it's still healthy

1689
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Then of course this becomes

1690
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Many people are very interested

1691
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
you know this...

1692
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
this is a receptor

1693
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
This is a GPCR receptor

1694
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
it's on the surface of the cell

1695
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
So it must be receiving some signal

1696
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
So this signal

1697
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Later, this signal in the body was also found

1698
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
someone to design one

1699
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Inhibition of such a segment of this receptor

1700
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
a period of ecology

1701
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
PEPTI

1702
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Such an inhibitory fruit fly eats

1703
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Its lifespan can also be extended

1704
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Then this gene is also present in humans

1705
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
So apparently someone is doing it right now

1706
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
How to increase human life span

1707
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
from fruit flies and from mice

1708
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And from the worms just mentioned

1709
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Some people are studying these genes of longevity

1710
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Discovery of the mechanism of this lifespan regulation

1711
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
These different creatures actually have one thing in common

1712
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,100
So do research with simple biology

1713
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:08,200
Of course it is more convenient and faster

1714
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,300
So in the end it's

1715
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:18,800
We can use fruit flies to study some things about people

1716
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,600
including development including disease

1717
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,000
Traditionally, we depend on the sky for food

1718
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,400
we filter

1719
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,100
These mutations occur randomly

1720
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,400
some is what we want

1721
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:35,600
You find the mutation, you find the gene

1722
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,000
then do research

1723
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,900
We can now do the reverse

1724
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,100
That is, many genes we already know

1725
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,300
maybe from people

1726
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,300
we can target this gene

1727
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,000
to create specific mutations

1728
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,300
To simulate some human diseases

1729
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,500
From these we can understand

1730
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,100
The function of these genes

1731
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,200
Learn about the genes they regulate

1732
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Only after you understand these basic things

1733
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Only you have the means to find a way to treat it and change it

1734
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
So from here we can get the mechanism of healing

1735
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Strategies for treatment, even using fruit flies to screen for drugs

1736
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
fruit flies are fast and cheap

1737
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
It also allows us to deeply understand the mechanism

1738
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
But in the end, fruit flies are not people.

1739
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Therefore, the drugs screened out by fruit flies may not be effective in humans.

1740
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
it has good reference value

1741
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
But the final experiment still needs to be done by people.

1742
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Or it’s not easy for humans to conduct experiments, so we need to use creatures that are closer to humans to do it.

1743
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,000
It is interesting to give an example at the end

1744
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
This is an old friend of mine Ross Kagan

1745
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,000
He was also the first to do eye development in Drosophila

1746
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
In recent years, he said that he would come for personal medical treatment

1747
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
He was a cancer patient

1748
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Then I found your tumor

1749
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I can sequence and know which genes are mutated

1750
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Then I put this mutant gene into fruit flies to express

1751
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
So I'm basically replicating your disease in fruit flies

1752
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So he called this the Avatar of Fruit Flies

1753
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
this stand-in

1754
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,000
So this fruit fly has certain mutations

1755
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,000
It fully reflects the condition of that patient

1756
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Then he targets this person

1757
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
These are the fruit flies that are used for drug screening

1758
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
drug screening

1759
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
He said I don't want to find new medicine

1760
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
There are already so many medicines

1761
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Every medicine has side effects

1762
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
So medicine often does not mean whether you can kill cancer cells

1763
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,240
How much damage do you do besides the cancer cells

1764
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:07,240
So he said I'd use a lower dose

1765
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,440
Then I take three medicines and five medicines together

1766
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:13,440
Every dose is low

1767
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,140
So his side effects are also low

1768
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:18,740
Then I thought there might be several mechanisms

1769
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,000
So I heal every mechanism

1770
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,840
So this is for the condition of this patient

1771
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,040
he can do large-scale screening

1772
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:33,040
Then find a certain combination of drugs

1773
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:35,040
kinda like cocktail therapy

1774
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,040
for this patient

1775
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:42,540
I don't know if this is successful yet.

1776
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,540
but an interesting attempt

1777
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:48,040
And he's in New York, he's looking for that rich guy

1778
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:52,240
Many rich people get sick

1779
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,840
are willing to invest in such a thing

1780
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,040
So he has quite a few patients who are currently

1781
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
doing these tests

1782
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,500
Maybe soon we will know this one strategy

1783
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,000
will it work

1784
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,500
This strategy is also due to the fact that in Drosophila

1785
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,000
You can do it cheaply enough at scale

1786
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,500
I will simply introduce to you today

1787
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,500
What kind of research can fruit flies be used for?

1788
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,000
I hope everyone knows

1789
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,500
Why is there a group of people who like to play fruit flies so much

1790
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,000
it's cute

1791
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Finally, thank you all

1792
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Many thanks to our Dr. Sun for his excellent speech

1793
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
I've seen a lot of people raise their hands

1794
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
So let's open some Q&A

1795
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
come please

1796
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

1797
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,500
but very sorry

1798
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:59,000
The question I want to ask is

1799
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
so

1800
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,520
Why on earth did you abandon your wife?

1801
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,140
But what I want to ask the teacher more is

1802
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:08,960
The teacher himself said in the speech that it is very annoying and enjoyable

1803
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,020
But it's been so many years

1804
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:14,600
So how does the teacher know when he encounters something he hates?

1805
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:16,380
This is what I will do in the future

1806
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:17,920
Then decide what you want to do in the future

1807
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,720
How to get over the nasty feeling

1808
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,280
I think many people want to know besides me

1809
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,060
please thank you

1810
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,860
good

1811
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:29,960
I'm interested in genetics

1812
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:34,320
So when I was a freshman in high school, I decided to

1813
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,360
Do basic biological research

1814
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,680
Then I am interested in genetics, so the candidate department

1815
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:43,520
I went to see some departments related to biology.

1816
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,320
I'm not particularly interested in plants

1817
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,140
But the heredity of plant lineage is very much

1818
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:50,960
They have a lot of lessons on genetics

1819
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,260
No need to learn a second foreign language

1820
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:55,560
So I chose the plant department

1821
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,920
In the Department of Botany, I took a lot of courses on genetics

1822
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,600
At that time, fruit flies gave me the feeling that it was a very traditional thing.

1823
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,000
decades ago

1824
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,400
So I went to Caltech

1825
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,600
People say that you choose the laboratory

1826
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,000
Someone recommended me this fruit fly laboratory

1827
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,400
I will talk about the Seamwater Benser later

1828
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,800
Then my immediate reaction was this old-fashioned thing

1829
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,000
i have no interest

1830
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,000
After studying for a few years, I read a lot of these papers

1831
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:34,400
I just knew that fruit flies are great stuff for a lot of things

1832
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,200
Then when I was doing my postdoc

1833
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,400
I also want to say that I will return to Taiwan in the future.

1834
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,400
Think fruit flies are cheaper

1835
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,000
At that time, I wanted to say that if I go back to Taiwan and have no money

1836
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,800
At that time, Taiwan had no money

1837
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,000
Just wanted to say you can afford bananas

1838
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,400
I have a microscope and I can do research

1839
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:58,200
Then once you feel that the question you want to ask

1840
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,000
Using fruit flies is a good material

1841
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Those who don't like it will admit it

1842
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
The microscope will make you dizzy

1843
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
just learn how to see

1844
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I watch eight hours a day

1845
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Then it got better and better

1846
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
So there's more to do

1847
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
come on the one behind

1848
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,000
please teach me

1849
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:26,000
It was in the process of the complete metamorphosis

1850
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Except for that knot that didn't change

1851
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Is there anything that hasn't changed?

1852
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
such as organs or neurobrains

1853
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Are you perverted?

1854
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Then the second question is that

1855
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Do householders have any advantages over those in the past?

1856
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,000
That is to say, why is he really a developer?

1857
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Instead of the development book

1858
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
After this family member mutated

1859
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
growing in other parts of the whole

1860
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I think it works like this

1861
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
ok what is the first question

1862
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:10,000
That's totally perverted

1863
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
this is very interesting

1864
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
That is, if he completely knocks out the rework

1865
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
You might want to call him a different entity

1866
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
He actually preserved his central nervous system

1867
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
His brain is not knocked out

1868
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
But the brain has also changed a lot

1869
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
a big change in his behavior

1870
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
part of his digestive tract is preserved

1871
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
also changed a lot

1872
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,000
But still change him on the basis of the original

1873
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,000
those cells on the surface of many other bodies

1874
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Just kill it and rebuild it

1875
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
so it was a very interesting process

1876
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
the second is

1877
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
that encore

1878
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Reenactment and solo performance

1879
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Sure enough, there are reprises and solo performances

1880
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
There are three solo stars on his head

1881
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
What you see on the two sides is not the same

1882
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
The monocular is very small so it basically has no resolution

1883
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Those eyes are bigger

1884
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Then its area can be seen from a very large angle

1885
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Just now there was a very interesting Wang Fu mentioned

1886
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
It's that Guoying's eyes are red.

1887
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
But this red is not a photosensitive pigment

1888
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
It has about 800 ommatidia in its secondary eye

1889
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Each ommatidium is a long tube structure

1890
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
The structure of the long tube is surrounded by pigment cells

1891
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
is to express this red

1892
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
So light can't get in from the side

1893
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
can only come in straight

1894
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
This means that it is on a spherical auxiliary eye

1895
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
every ommatidium every single eye

1896
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Seeing from a certain angle in space

1897
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
So as long as the monocular has light coming in

1898
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
It knows from which angle in the space the light comes in

1899
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,820
As for the difference between reenactment and our eyes

1900
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:08,820
also difficult to analyze

1901
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:13,320
But reenactment appeared very, very early in evolution.

1902
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:17,420
In the three night insects, that is, inside the painted stone

1903
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:19,920
Trinite bugs have the structure of repetition

1904
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,920
In fact, another question is

1905
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,920
when you fuck him

1906
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,920
Let's say another pair of reenactments

1907
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,920
Can the other reenactment be seen?

1908
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:36,920
Is it a functional reenactment?

1909
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,920
same with wings

1910
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,920
he has four wings can he fly

1911
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,920
still he can't

1912
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,920
coordinate

1913
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:45,920
Well, I don't know about the wings

1914
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,920
probably not good

1915
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,920
But it's a repeat, it grows on the wings and it's a repeat

1916
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:52,920
If you poke an electrode in

1917
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,920
then give him a light

1918
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,920
he'll have a reaction, a normal reaction

1919
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:58,920
So that photoreceptor cell is normal

1920
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,800
It grows in the position of the body, the brain is far away

1921
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:08,240
So its axis map can't be connected to the brain to connect

1922
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:11,440
So your brain doesn't feel the light.

1923
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,440
The brain does not receive the signal

1924
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,120
But just now you also mentioned

1925
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:19,880
Is its photosensitive color different from ours?

1926
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:23,480
Are we red yellow blue or red green yellow

1927
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:26,480
anyway it's going to fall outside the line

1928
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,400
it has a green

1929
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:32,400
There's a blue pigment and then there's an ultraviolet pigment

1930
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,400
so different

1931
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,400
it's not red

1932
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,400
There seems to be a problem just now

1933
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,400
green place

1934
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:46,400
Hello, teacher

1935
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,400
just put one

1936
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,400
Photos of Cang Ying's state camp chaos

1937
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:57,400
Then its right weight seems to be according to its

1938
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,400
it has a major axis

1939
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,440
So it was decided when it was still fertilized

1940
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,440
How does his body plan grow

1941
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,560
Isn't it just a matter of accepting him?

1942
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,960
I forgot what the name of that hormone is

1943
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:17,960
The effect is that the hormone will also cause fertilization

1944
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:22,360
It is the structural change inside a single cell

1945
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,240
well this is a very important question

1946
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:27,240
There are many people in the state-owned enterprise doing such research

1947
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:31,240
It's how the head and tail of your body are determined

1948
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:35,240
Let's see before the egg is fertilized

1949
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:38,240
In fact, his shape is already different

1950
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,240
So there are fronts and backs and burdens

1951
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:45,240
So this means that part of the decision

1952
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:49,240
The body axis decision is already decided when the mother

1953
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:52,240
how does mom control

1954
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:56,240
Then a lot of genes control this matter

1955
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:00,240
before and after

1956
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,760
it is consistent with mother's

1957
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:08,260
The back and belly are random

1958
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,660
But when the egg was formed

1959
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:12,660
These have already been settled

1960
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,560
its this egg

1961
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:23,200
Does a female eagle have only one egg?

1962
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,160
or is it?

1963
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,600
it can lay eggs continuously

1964
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,160
Can lay about two to three hundred eggs

1965
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,000
it's a lifetime

1966
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
almost

1967
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,400
good nutrition

1968
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,000
It can lay an egg in an hour

1969
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
So it's not the same as a crab

1970
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
crab words

1971
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
it is soft is one to one

1972
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
it's one down

1973
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
it also has two soft tides

1974
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
also like people

1975
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It's the one on the left

1976
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
There is one on the right

1977
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
in this way

1978
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
come please

1979
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

1980
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I think one problem is

1981
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
the same gene

1982
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
its on that fruit fly

1983
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Symptoms of its manifestation in humans

1984
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
are different

1985
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,500
So if we want to study the genetics of a human

1986
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,000
its words for some changes in human behavior

1987
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,700
So if we don't see some behaviors of diseases like that in fruit flies

1988
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,500
presented words

1989
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:15,000
So how should we proceed with our research at this time?

1990
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,500
Yes, now that you are doing research, of course you should find someone who can do it.

1991
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,000
So I saw some traits in fruit flies

1992
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Some behaviors can be similar to people

1993
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,500
Of course the man has something that the fruit fly doesn't have

1994
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:34,500
That's actually a lot of people do a lot you can't imagine

1995
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:38,500
Someone uses fruit flies to study depression, avoidance

1996
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,000
That is once you can analyze its behavior

1997
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,500
A lot of these things actually have similar

1998
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:49,000
So is this similar to the real thing?

1999
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Still need to do a lot of research to know

2000
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Sorry, there will be another problem like this

2001
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,500
Then if we start from

2002
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Some genes in Drosophila

2003
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,400
and found out that their behavior is different from human genes

2004
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:09,100
Then the research value of this gene in Drosophila

2005
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:11,400
For some of our human clinical medicine

2006
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,600
what kind of contribution

2007
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:19,600
We're all mostly focusing on that similar part now

2008
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,300
But it's interesting

2009
01:42:22,300 --> 01:42:24,400
Fruit flies are different from people

2010
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,100
so that different place

2011
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,600
In fact, there are many things worth studying

2012
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:33,600
It just doesn't sound very appealing.

2013
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:38,000
Especially less attractive for research funding

2014
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,800
But this is also a difficulty in our drug development

2015
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,400
In fact, fruit flies are far away from people

2016
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,700
He said it was 75% similar

2017
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:49,000
the mouse is closer

2018
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,800
We also use a lot of mice to test drugs

2019
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:54,900
People who are useful on mice are not necessarily useful

2020
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:58,300
So it's still time for the final drug to be developed

2021
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:00,500
still do some clinical

2022
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Only when the bed experiment is really useful

2023
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Are there any other questions?

2024
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
come over there

2025
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
wait a moment

2026
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
can you use the microphone

2027
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
You feel

2028
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
That's our research with nuts

2029
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
mainly to see

2030
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
just listen to see

2031
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
From DNA to infer its influence on disease

2032
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
but if i today

2033
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
just very simple

2034
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
from a functional point of view

2035
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
For example, I study nuts

2036
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
The neural circuits of the brain are healed

2037
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
But we know for sure

2038
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Nuts have the same number of nerves as

2039
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Complexity and the Human Brain

2040
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
there is a great feeling

2041
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
So if I research today

2042
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
It's me trying to get the nuts

2043
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
After the circuit coupon is created

2044
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
what do you want to build

2045
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Functional of human neural circuit

2046
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
It is a functional neural circuit

2047
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
how big is the gap

2048
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I think there must be a gap

2049
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
but we think

2050
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Hope from the structure of the brain of the nut

2051
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
how it works you'll learn some basic principles

2052
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,500
This principle can be applied to more complex brains

2053
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:11,500
like you go and get a simple computer

2054
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:17,000
Its operation must have a lot to do with supercomputers or related

2055
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:23,000
So you can make some progress in understanding supercomputers from the simple

2056
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,000
At least this is something that can be done

2057
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Now there are many difficulties in studying the human brain.

2058
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So many places have to

2059
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Please tell me that I just had that UBX picture

2060
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Will grow wings Will grow two wings

2061
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Is it possible to grow a third set of wings?

2062
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Then ask me how the UBX picture came from

2063
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Thanks

2064
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
That picture is actually very complicated

2065
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Those genes and their regulation

2066
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
very very complicated

2067
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,000
So just that one picture

2068
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
In fact, it is not a picture of a single point

2069
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
it is several genes

2070
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Several pictures put together

2071
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
to get that result

2072
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
That

2073
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Front

2074
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
yes it will be longer

2075
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
long third

2076
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
No

2077
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Probably many people have tried to find a way to do it

2078
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
So what I just saw was

2079
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Second pectoral knot and third pectoral knot

2080
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
It is possible to do a conversion like this

2081
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
The first chest knot is very different

2082
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
that so

2083
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
it must have some

2084
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
This mechanism is blocked

2085
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
So you can't activate it

2086
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
so far no one has found

2087
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I'm very interested in that longevity gene

2088
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
That

2089
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
you say he

2090
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,500
When using that peptide to suppress it

2091
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,500
You said it was alive and well

2092
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:09,000
My impression is that it is like in that place called Xian Chong

2093
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
C.L.N.E.L.E.R. People Go for This Longevity Gene

2094
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It turns out that it seems

2095
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,500
those who do not eat well

2096
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,500
Those who are thinner live longer

2097
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:22,000
But you said your vagina

2098
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,500
Don't talk about gut

2099
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,500
seems to be very healthy

2100
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,500
Has anyone tried to find small molecule drugs?

2101
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:35,000
Then I will live longer if I eat one a day

2102
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Well

2103
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
In the article just now, it used peptide

2104
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
that's been years

2105
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,500
So I guess someone used

2106
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,000
go find little medicine

2107
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,500
that small molecule

2108
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:48,000
uh haven't seen anything yet

2109
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
not yet

2110
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
All right

2111
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
hurry up or i

2112
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,500
Ha ha ha ha

2113
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,500
no

2114
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,000
Are there any other questions?

2115
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,000
good if

2116
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
if not we then

2117
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Thank you next time Professor Sun
