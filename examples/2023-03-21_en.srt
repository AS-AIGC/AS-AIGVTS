thank you all

76
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,840
Family members of Vice President Hua and then former President Wang Shijie

77
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,520
And hello to all the audience friends here

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,400
Thank you so much friends for coming tonight

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm sorry, it's reversed

80
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,320
Come to this occasion to hear this speech

81
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,280
That

82
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,480
Chen Rugang, Vice President Wang, talked about this period of time

83
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,000
I saw him quite a lot

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I can recognize it if I want to

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,280
special thanks to him

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,000
because during this time

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
including from to

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
At the beginning of this visit, there are actually a lot of troubles to Vice President Huang's place.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then let Vice President Huang be the host and introduce today

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
For me, it is actually a very, very great honor

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Especially on such an occasion today is the commemorative lecture given by former President Wang Shijie

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
As Vice President Wang mentioned just now, it means that Europe and the United States are actually in the

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
President Wang promoted the establishment of

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And he is very concerned. In fact, this morning he even read some of the techniques in his diary.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It can be seen that during the period from 1968 to 1969, he was constantly promoting and facilitating the establishment of such a new unit

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So for me to be the host of this lecture today

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a great honor and a lot of pressure

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
never thought to say

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In fact, I have given so many speeches today, I feel that the special pressure is a little bit greater.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But today's speech has a big purpose, in fact, the research institute faces the public

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
To make some such an attempt on the popularization of humanities

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then this also means that apart from doing its own research in the depths of Xiangyata, the research institute

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
In fact, we also hope that our research can bring some inspiration to the public and point to some different concerns.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mr. Lin, who was here just now, reminded me that many friends may also be very concerned about this issue of refugees.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I am curious if the refugee issue I am talking about today is related to the practice of saving refugees in the real world

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Of course there are some details that are close, but there are also some big differences.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then what I want to say is actually in the context of humanities science popularization

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What I want to bring to you today is not so much about the experience of the refugees themselves

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
more is to want through literature

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Learned such a perspective and media

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,240
how to discuss the story itself

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
Shaping Refugees

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,160
And what about the refugees themselves

114
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
stories about themselves

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
then why talk about refugees

116
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Why talk about refugees at this time

117
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,240
Why put refugee stories in

118
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,240
In today's historical time and space in Taiwan

119
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
Let's talk about this now

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,160
I think

121
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I believe many, many friends

122
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,360
should feel

123
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
for me

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,080
Discussion and development of this topic

125
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,160
actually in

126
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
during my own research

127
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
by reading in Yayi

128
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,280
these writers who grew up in america

129
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,160
They write their own

130
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,520
so-called discrete experience

131
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,080
especially vietnamese writers

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,960
Talk about how they escaped from Vietnam

133
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
came to america such a story

134
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
And at the beginning I felt something about him

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,920
interest and concern

136
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,560
then it's a bigger trigger

137
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,960
Actually two years ago

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,600
In other words, it was two years ago and three years ago in 2020

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,000
That is, the United States will withdraw its troops from Afghanistan in August 2020

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't know if you guys still remember the scene of the withdrawal

141
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
The helicopter took off from that platform

142
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,000
Then there are the many Afghan people everywhere

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,300
or can't get into the airport

144
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,500
or can only wave on the platform

145
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Or hope to catch the last class to leave Afghanistan

146
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
So today in 2023

147
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,000
Taiwan is also facing the threat of war in a certain sense

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Even when I accompanied Boxi to Taiwan last year

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I even have a very apt feeling that

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,500
in case something happens

151
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,000
Will we become refugees too?

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
In this sense

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Just from such an experience

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Makes me think about the refugee problem

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,500
May not be those others who are waiting to be rescued in the distance

156
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,000
It's right next to us and maybe even ourselves

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,400
own history and process

158
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
But let's hope it doesn't become our future

159
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,600
That's why I feel that from this time on

160
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Concerns over refugee issues

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Perhaps it is at this time that Taiwan society

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,200
a reminder that might be important

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,400
So let's talk a little bit more about this topic

164
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,600
refugee story

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
Of course the main character is a refugee

166
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,200
But at this angle of my entry

167
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
more important may be the story itself

168
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,000
Then I'll put this part of the story back later

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
Let me explain to you

170
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,800
Then in the subtitle

171
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
power liberty and dignity

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
In fact, several issues surrounding refugees

173
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
related concepts

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
For example, why do you want to become a refugee?

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
why be a refugee

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
because of lack of freedom

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
or hope for freedom

178
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,600
Why refugees deserve our attention

179
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,800
because they are also subjects of power

180
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,800
or worthy of our considerable power

181
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,400
even the existence of refugees

182
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
He needs more than freedom and power

183
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,000
more

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
may be dignity

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
those different levels

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Maybe it can help us to build a

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
our one for refugees

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
A more three-dimensional understanding

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So let me start today's talk

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I start with the W.H.O.D.N.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is a poet in England at the beginning of the patriotic century

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
is also a very famous modernist poet

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Have traveled to China

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And then there are some interesting ones like these

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
what is this called

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
poet's love relationship

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But love relationships I'm not here today

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Simply put, in the 1930s

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He actually paid attention to this

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The so-called German

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
these jewish refugees from central europe

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then I wrote such a poem

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I simply translate a little bit

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He said there are tens of millions of souls in this city

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
but also live in these

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But some people live in mansion villas

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
some people live in mansions

208
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
live in a hole

209
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Then what

210
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
for us

211
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
In fact, we are the group of people who have no place to live.

212
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,400
And we're the ones who don't have a place to live

213
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
that once we had a country

214
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
And we also used to think it was beautiful

215
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,400
But look at this map right now

216
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,900
you can also find where it is

217
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,400
but we can't go there

218
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
honey we can't go there

219
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,400
On the grave in this village

220
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
An old red mountain tree like this grows

221
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
every spring

222
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
it will re-germinate and re-grow

223
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
But what about our old passports?

224
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
won't regrow

225
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Our old passports don't grow back

226
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
These officials of this half times

227
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
knock and talk tell us

228
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
if you don't have a passport

229
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Then you are speaking from an official point of view

230
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
you no longer exist

231
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
but we're still here baby

232
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
but we're still here

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,300
Then this is his care and concern for the Jewish refugees at that time

234
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,800
Then let us also see

235
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,300
refugee to refugee

236
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,500
In terms of description, there are actually a lot of layers

237
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,000
A big part of it is actually his lack of power.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
or a view of the dispossessed state

239
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Well, this is also the most basic thing we usually do for refugees.

240
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,100
know

241
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,300
But the most interesting thing I think is in this kind of strength

242
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
He especially emphasized the matter of passports

243
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,700
These refugees are not without passports

244
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,000
It's that his old passport is no longer valid

245
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,000
And when you don't have a passport

246
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
you no longer exist

247
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,100
So what is this reaction

248
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,900
This reflects the fact that we are

249
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,600
This social life is actually in a very realistic sense

250
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,800
we live in this society

251
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,800
Sometimes our credit cards and our ID cards are more important than our people

252
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,400
There was once such an example in the United States

253
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,000
one famous on the one hand at harvard

254
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Not a professor in America a black professor

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,700
Because of this, I can't get his ID on me at the moment.

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
by his this

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It was the administrator of the residence who blocked the door.

258
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's ironic that the admin doesn't recognize his face

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I only recognize the ID he has on him.

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So for refugees

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do not have a certificate or a legal certificate

262
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
how to make him

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Documents that allow him to move

264
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
become part of the whole refugee story

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
a very core key

266
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Although in our daily life

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
may be a trivial thing

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you don't have any documents, just go ahead and do it again.

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But when war comes

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Documents may be the only thing that can prove you

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
a material that still exists

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Then further I want to use such a

273
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
simple expansion

274
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's think about our past few years

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
In the past three to five years

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
In fact, refugees are the international

277
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
a huge huge issue

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You can see these photos

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In fact, I deliberately unselected

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
as several

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
several perspectives to understand

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
so-called refugee status

283
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,080
One perspective is of course the most famous one in the lower left corner

284
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,800
Fleeing from Syria

285
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,680
on this beach in greece

286
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,800
This little sea that fell dead over there

287
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,600
Then also because of this photo

288
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,960
Syria's Refugee Crisis

289
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,680
Gaining great attention in the European Union

290
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,320
It also makes this Greece slowly unfold

291
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,880
including the refugee camp

292
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,280
Then more such an action of humanitarian relief

293
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,920
This picture in the lower right corner

294
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,640
what we can see is

295
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,040
It turned out to be changed

296
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,440
We can see that it's actually a boat

297
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,720
And it's a boat full of people

298
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,120
If you remember the so-called

299
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,320
Our Memory of Vietnamese Refugees

300
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,520
so-called boat people

301
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Probably such an image

302
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,960
And the funniest thing is this

303
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,680
This group doesn't just stuff the boat

304
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,640
and in

305
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,040
How to say

306
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,920
not just on board

307
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,640
on a boat full of people

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,560
Seeking this place to dock in the middle of the ocean

309
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,800
So in flight or in flight there is death

310
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,520
in danger while fleeing

311
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,520
what about when you arrive

312
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,400
After arriving, in the upper right corner is a photo of the refugee camp

313
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,120
then in the refugee camp

314
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,800
Actually these people live in tents

315
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,600
Then it is very likely that these people are in our impression

316
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,960
The so-called refugees are also people with darker skin.

317
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,920
In fact, if you take a closer look at the ethnicity of Afghanistan

318
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,120
or a false race

319
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,000
They may not all be so dark.

320
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,240
But in our current understanding and experience of refugees

321
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,040
I'm afraid it's the same as us for the so-called

322
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,120
Weak or poor countries are of the view that

323
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,960
or imagine being combined

324
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,240
So what I want to emphasize in these photos is

325
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,280
This is a group photo with no faces

326
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is a reality that can be seen as miserable or tragic

327
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,500
And this one is actually the one on the right, which may be the Naiming we most often see or may meet

328
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
But it's often the people we can't see

329
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Either they live in the camp far away from us

330
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Or they might just hang out with us

331
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
But it never occurred to us that they might come from somewhere else

332
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Or we might recognize them from somewhere else

333
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,500
But we don't understand what his past and experience are

334
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Then this goes into, for example, the experience of Naiming.

335
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
probably a lot about narrating this thing

336
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,500
How to tell Namin's story so that they can be accepted

337
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,500
How to describe his own experience so that his trauma can be alleviated

338
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:54,500
How do you describe your experience so that you can meet the requirements of the International Rescue Agency?

339
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,000
the required image and be able to obtain certain assistance

340
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
These are actually stories from Naiming’s experience

341
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,020
plays a very important role

342
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
exactly like his politics

343
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,360
OK

344
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,020
So simply a little bit in this

345
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,020
This is for refugees under the context of the United Nations

346
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Judgment or specification to do a simple combing

347
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,020
Then we go into

348
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
in other stories

349
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,020
On the left is this so-called 1948

350
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
human rights convention

351
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
then at the beginning

352
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
In fact, what I want to emphasize is probably that

353
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
We all agree that human rights are a

354
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,040
human beings are born

355
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
In this convention, the specification is as follows

356
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
It is an inherent dignity

357
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
man as man

358
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,040
A kind of dignity that should have or will have

359
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
and is one that cannot

360
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
are equal

361
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
And it is an inalienable right

362
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
As long as you are a member of human society

363
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
you have these things

364
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,060
What about this thing?

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,340
about liberty about justice about one of the most basic foundations of world peace

366
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:11,280
I'll put one like this in a moment about the so-called refugee status

367
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:20,480
And these discussions about these so-called freedoms and military exercises that they surround refugees so-called derived from

368
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,680
give a more in-depth explanation

369
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:28,160
But for now let's just walk through a simple illustration like this

370
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,720
Then he said that in this so-called

371
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
at the end

372
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,440
The last part he said

373
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,360
If people don't want to be forced to have other

374
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:52,840
Forced to resort to measures as a last resort to rebel against oppression and hegemony

375
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,560
Then human rights must be protected through legal norms

376
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
This is referred to in the Human Rights Convention

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,720
Why human rights matter because

378
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,240
If people don't want these people

379
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,200
take a violent and drastic action

380
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
to overthrow the government

381
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,120
If you come to protest, to carry out acts of violence,

382
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,720
Then we need to protect the human rights of these people

383
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,240
I think there is a hidden

384
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,400
A paradox in the relationship between the state and the people

385
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,440
This is when we talk about human rights today

386
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,840
A subject that is often likely to be encountered first

387
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,200
but i'll come back here later

388
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,560
on the right is

389
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,960
In 1951, the United Nations Refugee Agency formulated

390
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Regarding these treaties related to this so-called refugee

391
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,880
Well here is a

392
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,280
A definition of the word refugee

393
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,360
What did he call a refugee?

394
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,520
In addition to the above is to want to be in these specific time points

395
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,200
Those who are recognized as refugees are other than refugees

396
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,320
There is also an expanded definition in the second clause below

397
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
that is

398
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,040
if they were

399
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,840
If they have concerns about being

400
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,380
because of their race, religion, nationality

401
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,220
or the identity of a particular social group

402
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,880
or his political opinions

403
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,000
And if you have fear or worry about being oppressed or persecuted

404
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,500
Or leave his own country

405
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,580
or other than nationality

406
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,080
or there is no way because of fear

407
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,580
or unwilling to allow themselves to be protected by the state

408
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,500
And left the place where he used to live

409
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,960
These people seek elsewhere

410
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,540
seek settlement opportunities

411
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,740
in such a situation

412
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,000
These people can be called refugees

413
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
because they can't

414
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Because they are unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin

415
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,240
Well, to put it simply, what needs to be emphasized here is probably that

416
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,340
The Difference Between So-Called Immigrants and Refugees

417
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,000
Immigration means you can come back after you leave

418
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,580
A refugee is when you leave and don't come back

419
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,160
Then here we can see

420
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,620
to a certain kind of refugee or immigrant

421
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,840
In fact, there is a relationship that overlaps but differs

422
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,560
So here's a quick look at

423
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,680
In the past few years, in the relevant statistics of the United Nations refugee category

424
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,400
the real situation of some refugees

425
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,820
For example, in the world

426
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,280
The forcibly displaced population has reached

427
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,920
I'm not good at math

428
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,520
This should be about 89 million yuan

429
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,760
that's a very, very high number

430
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
then the next

431
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,400
For example in this

432
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,640
Among the so-called low- and middle-income countries

433
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,440
they refugees

434
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,280
83% of low- and middle-income countries

435
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,560
In fact, they have become places for these refugees.

436
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,400
Then there are 72% of refugees

437
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,560
In fact, he was taken in in a neighboring country.

438
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,960
or temporarily stopped

439
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And then let's say in Verenea which is a very special case

440
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
One out of every six is ​​actually a refugee

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Then stay on a small island in South America like Aruba, the so-called China Travel Island.

442
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And what surprised me the most is that a country like Türkiye

443
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
A country that may not seem particularly advanced to us actually hosts 3.8 million refugees

444
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
This is also a very astonishing number

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Then every year, for example, there are 1.4 million refugee applications in the United States to become refugees

446
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
To become a refugee is not enough to say that I am a refugee, you have to apply and be recognized and accepted

447
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Then, of course, I think the world on the right is very interesting.

448
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Or should I say something very important

449
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
very important one this

450
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,400
The numbers mean that among the world's population

451
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,100
Children make up 30%

452
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,040
But among these forced displaced

453
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,240
41% of the population is children

454
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,200
So you can imagine that among these displaced people

455
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,800
most of nearly half of

456
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,540
actually a minor

457
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,940
ok

458
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,500
These data are just for everyone to understand

459
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,400
That is to say, from the data

460
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Refugees are a very real

461
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,000
And this problem that is happening

462
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,040
And the refugee problem is a big one

463
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,300
facing several difficulties

464
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,100
one of course is to say

465
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,300
Do you want to accept refugees?

466
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Do you want to accept it, how to accept it, how to choose or not to choose

467
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
If you don't let them all in

468
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,000
Then how to arrange these people

469
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,300
after settling down

470
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,800
what happens to these people

471
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,000
how long will this placement take

472
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,800
How to solve the problem of refugees

473
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,000
In today's Europe and America

474
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,200
It's actually a huge debate.

475
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,400
especially in europe

476
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,200
Then I can discuss this in detail later.

477
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,600
So let's move on to the topic of refugees

478
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,800
Especially in the context of our East Asia

479
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
There are probably two parts that I particularly want to mention

480
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,200
One is what is the reason for the movement of refugees

481
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,800
why do these refugees show up

482
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,600
The second is the relationship between refugees and the history of our place

483
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,200
Is there any clear and specific relationship?

484
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,000
For example, from the history of the Vietnam War

485
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,800
Obviously, including in Syria or in Afghanistan

486
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,200
War is actually one of the reasons for the large number of refugees

487
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,000
Of course, there are other

488
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Including Tianhou, this change in climate

489
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Also, for example, hunger

490
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We'll probably mention this later

491
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This example from North Korea

492
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
In fact, a lot of it is related to hunger.

493
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
But politics is also an important factor

494
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
What's more interesting is that

495
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,000
What happens when refugees appear because of the war?

496
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
The rescue of refugees is only related to the existence of the base

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
There is a certain connection

498
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,100
For example, the photo on the right

499
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,100
It's actually in this place in San Diego, USA.

500
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,900
There is one called Campandleton

501
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,800
It's actually a Marine Corps base.

502
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,500
And in 1975 the outskirts of the base

503
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,800
Just set up the refugee forest below

504
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,600
As a facility to receive these refugees from Taonan, Vietnam

505
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,700
That is, here we can see

506
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
The movement of refugees is actually the same as the movement of the military

507
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,000
It has a state that cooperates with or intersects with each other

508
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
as if we just thought of

509
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
For example, in the experience of Afghanistan

510
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,300
These refugees actually just left on a U.S. military plane.

511
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,300
So at this time, let us think of a question

512
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,300
So what is the relationship between these military interventions and humanitarian assistance?

513
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,100
Then these refugees who were rescued

514
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,800
or accepted refugees

515
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,900
Are they enemies or allies?

516
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,600
Are you a foreigner or a compatriot?

517
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,100
Then this is the only one in Vietnam

518
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,760
These refugees speak from the experience of immigrants in the United States

519
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,720
so strong

520
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Because after the fall of Saigon in 1975

521
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,560
refugees coming to america

522
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,840
In the hearts of many Americans

523
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,760
refugees from vietnam

524
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,240
and most likely their enemies

525
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,560
But the reason why these people can come to the United States

526
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,000
Precisely because they used to be in the U.S. military

527
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
Be their ally in Vietnam time

528
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,280
or their translator

529
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,360
Or their other places that match these

530
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,720
Or simply put, these South Vietnamese regimes

531
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,360
person

532
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,760
They had the opportunity to come to Vietnam

533
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,000
sorry for coming to america

534
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,160
So in this sense

535
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,280
All refugee movements are related to the military

536
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,400
In fact, it is worth our deep thinking

537
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,000
It's also worth thinking about

538
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,240
For the identity of those who move

539
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,920
In fact, it often follows us

540
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,320
Judgments about politics are relevant

541
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,440
further in Taiwan

542
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,840
what is our own experience with refugees

543
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,720
In fact, not long ago, this documentary was screened on official business

544
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,640
It is said that there is a Jiangmei camp in Baisha, Penghu.

545
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,800
Once in 1978 to 1988

546
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:21,440
It is a refugee camp received as this so-called Vietnamese descendant refugees

547
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,560
Well, this Jiangmei camp is actually

548
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,460
This is the original

549
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,560
It is also the army or the camp where the army is stationed nearby

550
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,360
So again we see this relationship between a military and this refugee camp

551
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,460
But what's more, it's

552
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,260
The existence of this camp is actually in our memory

553
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,760
In fact, especially for young people, they may never have thought of such a thing.

554
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,360
So this director Liu Jixiong and his team

555
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,160
In fact, it took a lot of effort to rearrange and introduce such a history

556
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,960
allows us to see that in 1975

557
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,580
After the fall of Vietnam in 1975

558
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,740
In fact, Taiwan is also participating in the entire anti-communist camp.

559
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,780
played a humanitarian role

560
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,560
Although not particularly prominent

561
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,880
But it's also part of our history

562
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,940
But it is often not remembered

563
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,780
It is very interesting that in these coming to Taiwan these

564
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,060
Vietnamese refugees

565
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,860
Actually there are some good parts

566
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,900
In fact, the so-called Chinese

567
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,740
So this involves the whole of this guy in Vietnam

568
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,540
this so-called

569
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,180
Vietnam’s socialist identity actually includes Chinese

570
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,980
Chinese are also a very important presence

571
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,540
And the Chinese are also in this process

572
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,840
Come to Taiwan or even stay

573
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,140
Of course a large part also

574
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,700
Passed through Taiwan to other places

575
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,240
So this batch

576
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,320
Refugee compatriots in the atmosphere of the times at that time

577
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,840
Are they treated as refugees or as compatriots?

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Or possessed person or own person

579
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
They are refugees surviving in the dry sea

580
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Still regardless of some for the sake of freedom and democracy

581
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And the anti-communist consciousness that came to Taiwan

582
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Then I ask these few questions

583
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
In fact, I keep wanting to outline

584
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Probably through the refugees

585
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
stories and history

586
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
how to rethink

587
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
in this through the refugees

588
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Nearby we can see

589
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Political, military and humanitarian assistance

590
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
very complicated relationship

591
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
that soon i want to pass

592
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
A few stories from North Korea

593
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
talk to you further

594
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
This so-called refugee

595
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The relationship between refugees and stories

596
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's put it this way

597
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I chose these three works

598
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I won't go into specific details

599
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
but i think it's worth it

600
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Let me explain to you a little bit

601
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
This one on the left is called Puyanmei

602
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Actually

603
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
If you are on facebook

604
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
or easily found on Google

605
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
his photo

606
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Because he published such a book

607
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In order to live this book

608
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,280
Also has translation in Chinese

609
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,760
And then translated many other languages

610
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,440
It has been followed up and several books have been published.

611
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,160
The book is basically one of its own as a North Korean refugee

612
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,480
So-called

613
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,960
Testimonial A Testimonial and Narrative

614
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,960
So

615
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
Of course it now puts

616
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,080
what should i say

617
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,520
that is

618
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,160
This testimony and narrative speaks for itself

619
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
such an experience

620
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,280
Then in the middle this one is a

621
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Korean-American writer named Chris Lee

622
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,720
Wrote a novel written in 2013

623
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,080
叫做 How I Became a North Korean

624
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,760
that's how i became a north korean

625
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,240
This part of the novel is about

626
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,640
On the border between China and North Korea

627
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,360
this we now understand

628
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,240
It is the serious emergency on the China-North Korea border

629
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,840
Then strictly border this ethnic knowledge area

630
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,120
such a space

631
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,680
In fact, there were many in the 90s

632
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,080
There are many North Korean refugees

633
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,760
From North Korea to China

634
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,760
so so this story

635
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
It was in such a 90's

636
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,340
North Korean refugees North Korean refugees to China in the background

637
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,340
to talk about a Korean in China

638
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,140
Actually went to America

639
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,060
And then back to the border between China and North Korea

640
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,280
saw or encountered these refugees

641
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,780
And because of China's opportunity

642
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,980
Also considered part of the refugees

643
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,140
So How I Became North Korean

644
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:29,780
It's actually about showing an immigrant turned refugee.

645
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,900
Such an interesting but complicated relationship

646
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Then the novel on the right is a translation of

647
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,740
It was originally a novel written by a Korean writer in Korean

648
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,400
then translated into english

649
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,700
It's called I met...

650
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,860
Can't see Beauty now

651
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,140
I met Loki on Loki

652
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,860
It’s just that Beauty is very simple, that is, I met a person like Logic Magic

653
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,460
Logical fantasy is actually in this story

654
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,940
The refugee who didn't show up until the very end

655
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,020
But this story...

656
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The protagonist is actually a journalist in Korea

657
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
He saw this one about logic sickness

658
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This is the introduction of Escape

659
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And there is a touch to go after him

660
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
What is the experience of being a refugee?

661
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Then this probably has something to do with what happened to him in the story.

662
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Personal experience has an interesting contrast

663
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But I'll leave this part for now

664
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
The reason why we talk about these three is because

665
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
One is the self-narration of the refugees themselves, right?

666
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The other is through a very external perspective

667
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
To imagine being on the border between China and North Korea

668
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Possible Refugee Opportunities and Correlations

669
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And the other one is actually a projection entirely at a distance.

670
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But through this projection he initiated a process of seeking refugees

671
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
one of these three stories

672
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The juxtaposition actually presents an interesting

673
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
triangle structure

674
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
that refugees are often in the story

675
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Well

676
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,800
Among all the refugee stories on the Internet

677
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,440
He is often the one who is forced to

678
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,960
should say so

679
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,760
He is often the one imagined

680
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,640
But at the same time he was placed in a specific position

681
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,200
to express refugees

682
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,800
I'm not very clear about this

683
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,240
I simply put it this way

684
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,800
as a refugee

685
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,160
He was actually expected to tell a story about him

686
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,720
And the story that is expected to be told

687
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,280
has his script

688
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,080
For example we will see later

689
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
here it will be

690
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,040
I skip here first

691
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,880
It's clearer here

692
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,880
For example, the author Pu Yanmei is a North Korean defector

693
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
also a human rights fighter

694
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,440
his story is

695
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,480
His story brings people together

696
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,880
Behind the Iron Curtain regime in North Korea

697
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,640
The life of ordinary people

698
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,960
This is a video of him and his family trying to escape North Korea

699
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,920
Overcoming the pressure of freezing

700
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,040
Will escape the clutches of ex-pats and gangsters

701
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,720
Into the Gobi Desert to Mongolia

702
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,600
Defector's story on the flight to South Korea

703
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,240
If you read the introduction of such a book

704
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,440
you will find wow

705
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,120
it's simply a

706
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
an adventure story isn't it

707
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
then this adventure story

708
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
It is actually going to outline

709
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
such a thrilling escape

710
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So so included here

711
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
English is partly actually

712
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
An illustrated direction of the beginning of its story

713
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
In the first paragraph it says

714
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
On the cold black night of March 31st

715
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
at

716
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
This March 31, 2007

717
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
such a cold night

718
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
my mother and me

719
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
This squats very low

720
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Then press the green river

721
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
this frozen green river

722
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
crawling along the coast

723
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
This presses the green river to separate

724
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
North Korea and China

725
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Well here are a lot of

726
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Patrol guards in

727
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
above and below us

728
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
and then these

729
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
These guards will be here

730
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
per white foot

731
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Sorry, what is the name of every two in Chinese?

732
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
scold each other for nothing

733
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
There will be these guards in this episode

734
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Then

735
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
there will be soldiers and they say

736
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,580
anytime to those involved in crossing the border

737
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,380
so so we don't know what's going to happen

738
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,880
We just want to leave North Korea and go to China in a positive way or in a very extreme way

739
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
we might have a chance to survive

740
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,380
The story of Napu Yanmei tells a very typical

741
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,200
We're almost a typical refugee

742
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,320
In fact, this typical refugee image also reflects the image of refugees.

743
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,800
The story about refugees is placed in an almost stereotypical position

744
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,960
As a refugee, he must go through a lot of risks

745
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,840
As a refugee he must have gone through all sorts of brutality

746
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,640
as a refugee he must be

747
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,300
OK

748
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,440
Well, if you think about it, you will know

749
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,240
The millions of refugees we just saw

750
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,680
In fact, not all have the same experience

751
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,920
In other words, everyone's experience cannot be compared with pain.

752
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,680
OK

753
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,200
Well, but we need or say that among these solemn

754
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,600
but often as a reading

755
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,040
Perhaps more of what we are consuming is the suffering and experience of these people

756
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,960
as one of our wonders

757
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,680
So through this spectacle we inspired a

758
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,360
A kind of sympathy for the suffering of refugees

759
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,840
Well, of course this is to a certain extent

760
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Not necessarily a bad thing, right?

761
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,640
because we can see

762
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,560
In fact, we also have such an experience in our hearts.

763
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,600
It is possible to have a heart of silhouette

764
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,480
And not because it's from, say, North Korea

765
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,640
rather different

766
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,240
But here I think a very interesting question is

767
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,360
Will we because it's because of North Korea

768
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,040
And think differently about such refugees

769
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,720
Will we because of today's refugee

770
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,880
is from Syria or Afghanistan

771
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,240
and think differently

772
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm not asking this question as an answer

773
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,280
but a question

774
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,120
Actually let's think about it

775
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,240
When we're dealing with refugee stories and refugee status

776
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,480
Do we have some inherited ideas and concepts

777
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,160
These things are exactly what I hope through today's speech

778
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,240
able to propose

779
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I brought it up to think with everyone

780
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,200
ok then let's move on to this

781
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,700
How it Became North Korean

782
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,500
This is also in Guardian

783
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,500
One of the British Guardian newspapers for this book

784
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
brief introduction

785
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
let's take a look

786
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Most of these North Korean defectors

787
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,500
We are in Chinese and we have a term called defector

788
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,500
or this rebel of politics

789
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
They came to North Korea where they left

790
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
North Korea leaving via China

791
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
At any given time

792
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
anytime

793
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,500
There would be thousands of these refugees here

794
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,500
hiding in this state of living in hiding

795
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Scared they might be caught and deported

796
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Women may be trafficked into this

797
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,500
The so-called new workers or married people

798
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
These Chinese farmers who can't get wives

799
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Then men may be violently oppressed by this gangster and become a special park

800
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
These teachers of the church, these teachers of the Jesuits may also

801
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Why, no matter what, they may come to aid and resettle these refugees

802
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
But sometimes, they are treated as criminals.

803
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:39,000
even force them to read the bible and ask them to change their religion

804
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
in exchange for their freedom, or their loyalty to the country

805
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So he said this novel, he is among several different narrators

806
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Make an exchange where the male lead is called Yongju

807
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
He's a kid who was supposed to be a high ranking North Korean general.

808
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Then because of this

809
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,440
Killed for political reasons

810
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,880
So he and his mother fled

811
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,440
and my sister escaped

812
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
During this escape

813
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,040
Mom and sister are lost

814
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,560
He's left alone at the Chinese border

815
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,000
stay above

816
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,600
Then the other one is called Johnny

817
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,840
is a female

818
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,240
Then she was pregnant before fleeing.

819
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,200
so you can see

820
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,280
Just before this description

821
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,880
This part about this so called sex trafficking

822
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,320
Maybe it's related to Johnny's story

823
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,520
Then there is another fact that

824
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,680
the one we were talking about

825
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,920
originally grew up on the edge

826
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,280
then went to America

827
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,880
back to the edge

828
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,600
During this experience

829
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,360
Accidentally mistaken for a North Korean

830
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,320
Such a person is called Danny

831
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,920
so so i think this story is very interesting

832
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,200
He sees through this Danny's point of view

833
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,400
let's see say

834
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,120
when you don't have a passport

835
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,480
when you have no documents to prove

836
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,680
who are you when

837
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,080
in the Sino-Korean border

838
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,600
you are likely to be treated as

839
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,000
One who fled North Korea

840
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Then this as a

841
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,560
is highly risky

842
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,060
OK

843
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,640
Then the only salvation is in this story

844
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,440
The only salvation is through this assistance of the Church

845
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,740
And the church has become another

846
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,820
Another form of coercion for this institution

847
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,120
they may threaten you

848
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,160
if you don't listen

849
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,440
hand you over to the police

850
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,500
Or like this unit report in the locality, etc.

851
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,560
Then this is the description in the story

852
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,100
Then I think these descriptions are also

853
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,400
Based on my understanding and research

854
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,440
there are also some

855
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,600
basic

856
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,540
Sometimes the writer actually did some research and investigation

857
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,200
wrote such a story

858
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,800
Then this story shows us another

859
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,000
This one from Taonan in front of this one

860
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,800
Beyond the template and the typical

861
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,600
What is less noticed is that

862
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,680
A dialectical relationship between the seekers of the South and the rescuers

863
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,440
And the core of this story is that Danny became the hero who saved everyone

864
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,480
And why does he have such an ability

865
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,200
He actually grew up on the edge of a rock

866
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,840
So he also has a family background that can help

867
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,760
He recovers his identity in the process of fleeing

868
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,600
At the same time, he also rescued his fellow sufferers

869
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,800
I think the last story is also very interesting.

870
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,200
I'll introduce you soon

871
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
In fact, it is about such a person as Locking One.

872
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,000
He is also a North Korean defector

873
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,200
then in this story

874
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,600
I didn't describe how he defected from North Korea

875
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,800
Just simply stating that he has experienced difficulties from scratch

876
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,400
came to belgium

877
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
He came to Belgium without knowing a word of French

878
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,200
I don't know how to live in this place

879
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,400
He only has a few hundred euros in cash

880
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,400
must live every day of his stay in belgium

881
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,600
through for this

882
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,000
It is in this story that the heroine

883
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,160
North Korean defector's recourse for this refugee

884
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,160
he experienced again

885
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,880
This North Korean defector was in a Belgian

886
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,480
each step for example

887
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,760
How to get to the hotel where he stepped down at the time

888
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,120
To face those who may have been for this refugee at that time

889
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,360
Those who are not very polite in the interaction

890
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,360
The hotel staff

891
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,880
how to face the possibility

892
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,640
It's not the people who really bullied him back then.

893
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,080
But in his experience

894
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,600
those who are very sure

895
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,240
Very self-sustaining these European whites

896
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,120
Interacting with Asians

897
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,520
So in my opinion the story

898
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,200
actually put the story

899
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
In fact, using refugees as a figure

900
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,520
a clue

901
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,520
His clue allows readers as well as writers

902
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,520
Be able to recount experiences that a refugee might have encountered

903
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,320
while putting yourself in

904
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,120
in that experience

905
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,800
in this sense

906
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,000
He and the one in front

907
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,400
I became North Korean

908
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,600
a little bit like

909
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,120
In fact, we are all asking us to put ourselves

910
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,800
plunge into that refugee experience

911
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,320
then in this sense

912
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,000
he left

913
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
he left on the one hand

914
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,680
This so-called third-person description

915
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,080
also left a first-person

916
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,600
The so-called subjective refugee

917
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,200
spectacle self-narrative

918
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,880
Instead, it creates a

919
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,240
reflective space

920
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,160
let's think about it

921
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,960
How to tell refugee stories

922
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,280
to be able to tell the stories of refugees

923
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,680
Three-dimensional

924
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Speak well

925
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,360
To be able to make the refugee experience

926
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
not just as a

927
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,080
to be consumed

928
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,640
but one that can help us

929
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,080
such a possibility of self-reflection

930
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,960
So in this story

931
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,240
there is a very classic

932
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,360
very important in my opinion

933
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,520
and a part of the classic

934
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,480
That's Loki 1 in Belgium

935
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,360
ended up staying very successfully

936
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,280
So I won't expand on the details of the head.

937
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,400
but what about after this stay

938
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,200
he is attending

939
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,360
Working in a restaurant, I met a guy from the Philippines

940
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,960
illegal immigrant

941
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:07,800
That's because of this illegal immigrant woman from the Philippines

942
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,200
don't speak french

943
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,600
So he always wanted to go to an English-speaking country

944
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,600
After Lokkawang met her

945
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,000
The two of them are actually just this colleague in the restaurant

946
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,200
But the application for a long time

947
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,300
So when this girl decides to go to England

948
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,400
Lokkawang is also disregarding himself

949
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,200
Willing to follow her to England

950
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:32,800
So for the heroine of the story, the narrator,

951
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,600
He thought it was an unimaginable thing

952
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,500
He had a hard time getting out of his refugee status.

953
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,800
why is he willing to let go

954
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,800
The chance to finally get settled in this Belgium

955
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:45,700
And once again became a refugee and ran to

956
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:48,600
Or at least an illegal immigrant to the UK?

957
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,400
In the course of this pursuit, he discovered that

958
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,300
it's actually really easy

959
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,900
Because in their step by step

960
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,000
in the process of creating your own life

961
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
They're no longer the subsidized, doled out refugee

962
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
In the process of no longer being self-reliant and self-reliant

963
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
These refugees have their own dignity

964
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
He knows he can live like everyone else

965
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Learning another language is hard work

966
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Adapting to another environment is not easy

967
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
But this provides an opportunity for them to strengthen themselves

968
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
So so I want to pass through these few stories

969
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
What I want to outline is probably such a simple thing

970
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
that's what we know about refugees

971
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
cannot just stay at one

972
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
In the relationship between the recipient and the sympathizer

973
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
At the same time, our experience with refugees cannot only be

974
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
treat it as outside this visible window

975
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
such an invisible being

976
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
They are likely to be around in our daily life

977
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
maybe as we know these

978
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The so-called migrant workers from Southeast Asia are also good

979
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
or the previous

980
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,340
others from different places

981
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,160
These moving crowds of different cultures are also good

982
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,120
Not necessarily in our extreme vision

983
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,280
But they are equally important

984
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,800
They are also fighting for their freedom and dignity.

985
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,440
Soon I will provide a little bit of good context

986
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,040
Let everyone understand why North Korean Namin is in my discussion

987
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,880
play a relatively important role

988
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,640
On the one hand, if you still remember the numbers I mentioned earlier,

989
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,960
Stories about the Vietnam War

990
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,280
In fact, the whole Vietnam War story is an anti-Communist story

991
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,400
if we can

992
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,000
A slightly rough word for understanding

993
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,760
So so today we are imagining

994
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,800
when North Korea or North Korea

995
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,120
In fact, the supporters of North Korea are often placed in a

996
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,320
To understand from the anti-communist narrative

997
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,080
These people turn north means they are against Kim Jong Un's regime

998
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,520
Against such a state of North Korea

999
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,760
The freedom they fought for was in a larger sense

1000
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,400
It affirms the value of democracy and freedom

1001
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,760
But if you look closely at these people

1002
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,920
The experience of these North Koreans who came to South Korea

1003
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,700
When you come to experience in different places

1004
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,760
you realize

1005
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,260
that democracy and freedom

1006
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,200
In fact, it is not as tolerant as imagined

1007
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,600
that democracy and freedom

1008
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,200
Actually asked these people

1009
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,700
conform to a particular image

1010
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,700
provide a specific function

1011
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,000
No matter what we talked about in the early years

1012
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,600
An imagination of anti-communist consciousness

1013
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,700
Or today we talk about North Korean defectors

1014
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,700
or some other attempt at such expression

1015
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,300
In fact, to a certain extent

1016
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,600
Otherize this so-called refugee

1017
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,900
Othering means

1018
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,700
There is actually a distance between you and me

1019
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,100
I can see you so much

1020
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,100
But that distance exists

1021
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,800
of course here

1022
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,500
So to simplify the context of this detail

1023
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,700
That is to say, during the period from 1994 to 1998

1024
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,100
In fact, there was a big famine in North Korea

1025
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,900
Then in this frenzied state

1026
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,900
Many people left North Korea

1027
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,500
Then this departure is for North Korea

1028
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,840
For the people before 1994

1029
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,140
Before a big move

1030
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:10,500
Actually, it's not a serious matter for them.

1031
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,080
Because the border between China and North Korea is not so tight

1032
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,880
a state of strict

1033
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,200
Many residents in North Korea

1034
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,500
probably during the cultural revolution

1035
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,340
It happened to be the one who fled from the border to North Korea

1036
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,960
So these groups where a lot of people trade across the border

1037
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,780
It may also be in the process of border

1038
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,820
form a so-called cross-border group

1039
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,640
Not to mention the so-called Koreans along the border

1040
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,740
In fact, in a long historical context, in the rainy environment of Northeast Asia

1041
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:44,040
In fact, there are many cross-border mobile

1042
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,880
So it's actually the border that separates the two sides.

1043
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,520
In other words, the state system actually separates the people living on the border

1044
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,340
Then in the context of the 1990s

1045
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,400
Those who escaped from North Korea

1046
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,440
In many cases, it will be regarded as a so-called economic immigrant.

1047
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,400
But in China there is no way to recognize them as economic immigrants

1048
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,600
Because there is actually a treaty of friendship between China and North Korea

1049
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,760
What this treaty subsequently stipulates or requires is

1050
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,280
China should not be concerned about the stability of this regime in North Korea

1051
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,280
pose any threat

1052
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,200
So if China accepts these fleeing refugees as economic immigrants

1053
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,720
To some extent, the above is the opposite.

1054
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,680
The political situation and economic instability in North Korea

1055
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,720
As a result, possible conflicts between the two countries

1056
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,000
Then it is also impossible for him to admit that they are so-called defectors

1057
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,640
is to defect from North Korea

1058
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:39,760
politics

1059
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:40,880
the rebellion

1060
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,880
not a rebellion

1061
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,320
meaning in politics

1062
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,640
Because it also shows that China may become accommodating North Korea

1063
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,640
a space of meaning molecules

1064
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,520
So in this sense

1065
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,480
Whether it's a North Korean defector

1066
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,080
It doesn't matter if it's meaningful

1067
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
whether economic refugees

1068
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,800
economic migrants or refugees

1069
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,080
These different identities

1070
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,280
In fact, it is impossible to know exactly

1071
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,520
and explain a dilemma and experience they encountered

1072
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,600
That's why

1073
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
So we need to compare a

1074
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,840
The concept of immigration and this imagination are further investigated

1075
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,320
Those few stories help us build a simple context

1076
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,120
This is what I was probably just trying to say

1077
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,120
After 2000

1078
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,320
because of the tightening of border controls

1079
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,240
so that also changed the policy

1080
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,720
Also reject North Korean defectors from South Korea

1081
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,120
So some defectors

1082
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,680
In fact, through China

1083
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,320
maybe to thailand

1084
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,440
Then I went back and forth to Europe and the United States

1085
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,840
then this brings us to

1086
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,560
Among the problems of survival and freedom in disasters and politics

1087
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,680
It might just be a formal number

1088
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,880
or outline a state of refugee existence

1089
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,760
That also reminds us

1090
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,760
The whole is in the rainy environment of East Asia

1091
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,800
Whether it's civil war

1092
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Whether it is the Cold War or not, it is actually a situation that has not completely ended.

1093
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So after defecting from North Korea, Po Yeon Mi had a saying

1094
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
He said why he left

1095
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
just want to live like a human

1096
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Then this imagination of wanting to live like a human being

1097
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Back to a discussion about human rights

1098
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Let us see a couple of very complex paradoxes

1099
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
For example, where do the human rights of refugees come from?

1100
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
If we go back to these conventions

1101
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
stipulated in the convention

1102
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
But these provisions of the convention

1103
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Which unit is there to implement, realize and guarantee?

1104
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So Hanna two rounds in the 1940s

1105
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
In these notes written in the 1950s

1106
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
In fact, we are constantly discussing this issue about human rights.

1107
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the issue of citizenship

1108
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
from his point of view

1109
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
without citizenship

1110
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
In fact, it is almost equal to no human rights

1111
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Because you don't have a country to provide your human rights protection

1112
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Human rights are actually the very people who are deprived of human rights

1113
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
the one that was attached

1114
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
imagined political rights

1115
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So if we go back to the whole political practice of refugee movement

1116
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It is often seen that a situation like this occurs

1117
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
That is to say, when he has no way to obtain any local acceptance and status

1118
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
These people are excluded

1119
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Whether it's cast adrift at sea

1120
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
or simply be resisted or shut down in this

1121
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Beyond this so-called barbed wire

1122
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So Allen said that this Paradise is

1123
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
after you lose your human rights

1124
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
This makes the issue of human rights a key

1125
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
so what

1126
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
how about this from citizen

1127
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
through the protection of citizens to make these people

1128
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
have access to the same human rights protections

1129
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
become an important starting point for the entire human rights discussion

1130
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
But this is only one end of the human rights debate

1131
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I skip here a little bit

1132
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
come back later

1133
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,600
Also recently on the sidelines of the human rights debate

1134
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:08,060
Because from another French sociologist

1135
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,060
From Huang Siye's point of view

1136
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,060
The idea of ​​talking about human rights

1137
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,560
In fact, it is a process of political consultation

1138
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,060
It is precisely because these people have no human rights

1139
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,560
But you admit that they are human

1140
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,560
So human rights have become a topic worthy of everyone's concern and discussion

1141
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,960
So that means when we discuss human rights

1142
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,480
In fact, we are comparing the human problem with the mobile problem and the refugee problem

1143
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,480
Put it on a political god

1144
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,480
Here we can directly think of

1145
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,980
For example, think about Hong Kong, which we supported very much a while ago

1146
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,480
Many Hongkongers want to come and stay

1147
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,480
Whether you can stay or not is actually a lot of questions here.

1148
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,580
It's not that we verbally

1149
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,580
Conscious support for them

1150
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,080
we can easily hijack them

1151
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,580
This involves the revision of the presidential decree

1152
00:53:54,580 --> 00:54:00,080
to all kinds of national borders and national political imagination

1153
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,400
these topics

1154
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,280
Those things are actually

1155
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,440
view throughout the

1156
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,080
Our current imagination of politics

1157
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,440
above this question

1158
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,040
are very closely related to

1159
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:12,960
So Hong Siye said

1160
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,760
There is a saying that is

1161
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,200
These refugees fighting for human rights

1162
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,600
or wait for human rights

1163
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,800
Humanitarian Refugees

1164
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,800
In fact, in the whole social community

1165
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,840
no share

1166
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,160
It's just that they don't actually have such a share

1167
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,840
But what?

1168
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,440
It is precisely this lack

1169
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,320
is that we are worth discussing and working hard

1170
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,880
to make it up

1171
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,520
That's also in a sense

1172
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,120
pushes us to imagine

1173
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,360
In the context of Taiwan

1174
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,280
to imagine the existence

1175
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,200
or that name

1176
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,480
such a

1177
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,640
A possible advance on the law

1178
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,880
Do we have such a tolerance

1179
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,800
is there such a one

1180
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,280
willing to accept one's own mind

1181
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,680
to receive those who might come into our territory

1182
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:55,680
these refugees

1183
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,200
Today we are almost

1184
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,640
This issue is not discussed in this society

1185
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Surprisingly

1186
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
In fact, we also have such a meaning of accepting refugees.

1187
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
If you go back to Peng Hu's story about the Meiying area,

1188
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
then today we will

1189
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
what can we do

1190
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
participate in the international community for these

1191
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
People who drift and suffer in the world

1192
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Offer some of our possible assistance

1193
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Where are our formal conditions and our legal conditions

1194
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
This may be our further

1195
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
worthy of discussion in this society

1196
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
then time is limited

1197
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm going back a little bit quickly to two snippets

1198
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I especially want to emphasize

1199
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Especially in these two segments

1200
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Wanting to repeat the further misfortune is

1201
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
In fact, for refugees

1202
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
the situation they live in

1203
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
What we can see is

1204
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
language and writing

1205
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
In fact, it is a very important ability

1206
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,120
with the condition

1207
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,240
because it's about whether they can be seen

1208
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,840
so many refugee stories

1209
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,400
in a certain sense

1210
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,120
Although there is such a book market

1211
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,440
These needs for spectacle

1212
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,200
but a larger part

1213
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,080
record keeping

1214
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,280
The experience and experience of these people

1215
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,960
So that is to say

1216
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,320
we can't just blame the book market

1217
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,080
may want specific marketing

1218
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,320
For example, a type like Puyanmei

1219
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,520
image

1220
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,000
or put all these

1221
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,200
The refugee experience has become a

1222
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,280
Very orientalized story

1223
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,040
At the same time beyond such a critique

1224
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,320
we should also see

1225
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
behind these stories

1226
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,160
the moods it wants to record

1227
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,200
follow the sound

1228
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,600
Because these sounds may just be

1229
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,080
a possibility that they can be heard

1230
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,360
Back to Erlan

1231
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,080
When Erlan was discussing that there were too many refugees

1232
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,760
there is a very

1233
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,040
self-deprecating

1234
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Or a statement like Synical

1235
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
He said what refugees need most

1236
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
What refugees need most is people's livelihood

1237
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
what kind of livelihood

1238
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
What kind of livelihood is good

1239
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
as long as you can make trouble

1240
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
able to be seen

1241
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
then you have a chance for power

1242
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Think about it, everyone

1243
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
In fact, in our society

1244
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
in today's world

1245
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
probably a lot of the time

1246
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
those who can't be heard

1247
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
with those who can't be seen

1248
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Or the crowd is actually not recognized by us

1249
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
remember and understand

1250
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
So so language and story

1251
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
ID, diary, write these things

1252
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
i think it might be in

1253
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
researching refugee stories

1254
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
An action that is particularly worthy of our concern

1255
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
From this point of view

1256
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
all

1257
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
or in my understanding of

1258
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
so-called literary studies

1259
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
or cultural studies

1260
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
It's not just closed doors

1261
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Only read novels and stories

1262
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
is a consumer behavior

1263
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It's actually all one

1264
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,560
Our one conduit to the world

1265
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,360
That is to say

1266
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,420
If we have any connection with the world

1267
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,500
What we often have to ask is our connection with the world

1268
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,280
where did it come from

1269
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:16,120
Where do we start our relationship with the world?

1270
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,460
I am borrowing, for example, one from Teacher Qian Yongxiang

1271
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,240
i think he has a

1272
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,040
It's an interesting question, he said

1273
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,600
Especially when talking about cross-strait relations, he said

1274
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:28,160
People of their generation may not know

1275
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,200
Teacher Qian Yongxiang

1276
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,520
Also in the Institute

1277
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,580
A retired professor at this human center

1278
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,400
retired researcher then he is this

1279
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,940
contact ideas

1280
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,720
an editor in chief of this publication

1281
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,280
He actually cared for so long

1282
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,880
The interaction between the two sides of the strait, especially the exchange of ideas

1283
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,180
So he said that in their generation, he was probably

1284
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:51,460
the 50s

1285
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,520
Born in the late 40s and 50s

1286
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,560
This so-called

1287
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
people of this generation

1288
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
He said that in their interactions with mainland Chinese people

1289
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
There is this care of a modern China

1290
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
That is to say, for them, communication between the two sides of the strait

1291
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Talking about modern China is a common language for each other

1292
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
or shared care

1293
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But our generation

1294
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Or the generation later than us

1295
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
When communicating with the mainland

1296
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
what is our connection

1297
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
our relationship today

1298
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Probably Rising China, right?

1299
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Maybe it's a Chinese threat or something

1300
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So from a conversation like this

1301
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
What I'm actually going to expand on is that

1302
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
not the point is not to say

1303
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Are we already in the world

1304
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Or do we lack an international outlook

1305
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
No further connection to the world etc.

1306
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The point is that

1307
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
How do we connect with the world

1308
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
i think the president's reading

1309
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
different novels and stories

1310
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
In fact, it provides exactly one

1311
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
a way to bring us into the world

1312
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I feel special in this

1313
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,300
how to say

1314
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:08,700
Thanks to myself for being able to work in such an academic field of literature

1315
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,000
to grow and develop

1316
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,340
because it really drives me some

1317
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,180
Opportunities that may not exist in other fields

1318
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:22,020
And these opportunities are actually some of our different channels to the world.

1319
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:28,420
So today on this occasion I can share these discussions with you

1320
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,180
Actually a big expectation

1321
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,180
In fact, I hope that the friends here

1322
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:39,180
In addition to understanding what a researcher's research colleagues are doing

1323
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:44,540
Also think about the ways in which we can interact with the world

1324
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,140
What topics and topics are worthy of our development and concern?

1325
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,460
From this we can reconstruct

1326
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,700
even develop a Taiwan society that is different from the past

1327
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,800
and the relationship between Taiwanese society and the world

1328
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,100
Then I think it's almost time to talk about this place today

1329
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,700
If you say something bad, please include more

1330
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,300
Thank you very much Vice President Huang and

1331
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,400
Dean Wang Qin's family members and friends present

1332
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,800
very happy to have this opportunity today

1333
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,500
I can meet you here

1334
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,100
thank you all

1335
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,900
this we thank you for this

1336
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,200
Professor Wang's explanation of this

1337
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,900
Real Refugees and Refugees Presented in Literature

1338
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,200
The relationship between the two is of course very complicated

1339
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:41,100
There are thousands of threads in this intricate relationship

1340
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,200
I think everyone must have different questions in their minds.

1341
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,700
want to ask questions

1342
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,600
So I think we're going to open it up to the audience right now.

1343
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,700
to ask questions

1344
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,000
then we have a good one

1345
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,800
Do you want to explain the small gift?

1346
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,100
We have a quota of 10 small gifts

1347
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,160
That's an alcohol bottle, although the epidemic has slowed down

1348
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,500
But this may take a while so we'll

1349
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,080
Give everyone a souvenir made by Academia Sinica

1350
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:14,840
Thanks

1351
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:15,360
yes

1352
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,920
now please everyone

1353
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,720
speak up

1354
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,040
Hold your hand, this gentleman raises his hand first

1355
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,580
Please say

1356
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,540
Send the day first

1357
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,100
then come join the army just aired

1358
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,640
i see them

1359
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:38,200
At the beginning they also knew that there was a shortage

1360
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,240
Medicine, in March last year

1361
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,040
full drug shortage

1362
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,320
food

1363
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,900
That's when they were all pitiful

1364
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,680
The east belt lacks everything

1365
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,520
In the end, the Taiwan government was always missing, and they didn't forget about us.

1366
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,600
In this way, after joining the army, give me the Taiwan flag

1367
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,620
I think

1368
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,380
impossible

1369
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Would you like to stand in the middle

1370
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Because you are the protagonist under this brow light

1371
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Thank you very much for sharing this friend

1372
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Indeed, I think we are actually on this matter in Ukraine

1373
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But it should be said

1374
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I think Taiwanese society has

1375
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
This desire and imagination for participation in the international community

1376
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
desire, will and ability

1377
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
In fact, it is much stronger than before

1378
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Glad to be there to actually visit

1379
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
See this friend who Naiming helped

1380
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I probably think

1381
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
if stretched a bit

1382
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
What I'm trying to say is probably

1383
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Our Contact with Naiming

1384
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Including myself, I didn't actually have any real contact with Naiming.

1385
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
so i can't say

1386
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
what should we say

1387
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But from the context of a literary study

1388
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
In fact, what keeps reminding ourselves is an ethical issue

1389
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
That is, in the context of this contact

1390
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
what was their response

1391
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
what is our attitude

1392
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And are there any other expectations that interfere with this relationship?

1393
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
In fact, it may be a very simple relationship of mutual assistance and assistance.

1394
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Then when I understand that means

1395
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
A lot of international aid today is in the context of Taiwan

1396
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
There is such a need to see Taiwan or the expectation of Taiwan Can help

1397
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Then I think it's understandable, and it's what we've been doing for so many years.

1398
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
The accumulated political, cultural, and economic power

1399
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
An opportunity worthy of international exposure

1400
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
But what I keep thinking about is probably

1401
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Then, are there some ethical issues that may be deeper in this, and we will think about it later?

1402
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Then I just throw this question out for everyone

1403
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
and no further criticisms or thoughts on this

1404
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I also hope to take this opportunity to hear more about your experiences and ideas.

1405
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
That's because our central research

1406
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Because Ukraine has accepted many Ukrainian refugees since the war

1407
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Not to mention some compatriots from Hong Kong like this

1408
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
So this is a process where you can see a lot of hard work.

1409
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Well, we're actually lucky too.

1410
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
This hope does not become a refugee

1411
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
that other

1412
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
This woman is fine, let's start with a woman

1413
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
one man one woman one man one woman

1414
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Hello teacher, I am a student of the Institute of Literature

1415
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,120
is also a nonfiction writer

1416
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,560
Then I focus on the topic of "Tibetans in Exile"

1417
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,160
Then I just heard the teacher say

1418
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,840
Do you think language and writing are very important

1419
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,880
because need to be seen

1420
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,320
I agree with this

1421
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,960
Well, I have a small question,

1422
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,720
Because the "Exile" we are in contact with

1423
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,920
In the process of telling the story, in fact

1424
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,160
found out that one thing is

1425
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,280
In fact, the so-called traumatic memory

1426
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,080
They are likely to be in the present moment of memory preservation

1427
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,240
because it hurts

1428
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,600
So they have to do the preservation in a twisted way

1429
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,920
which is very likely what we recorded

1430
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,360
the story we heard was

1431
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,680
There will be this truth of truth and falsity of the story

1432
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,080
that being a writer is because a recorder

1433
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,400
what do you think teacher

1434
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,760
but we have to write we have to say

1435
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,440
But I really have no way to verify the authenticity of the story

1436
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,080
thank you very much for your question

1437
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,480
It's really common

1438
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
A common discussion on refugee issues

1439
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
For example, when a

1440
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
How about this refugee seeking asylum?

1441
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The story he told, how do you verify that what he said is true?

1442
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
It's fake, it's included in the novel I just described

1443
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
In fact, there is one, the third book

1444
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
In fact, there is a very important plot is

1445
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
He this Loki One when he came out

1446
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
In fact, no, I don't have any documents on me anymore.

1447
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
can prove who he is

1448
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
So he needs a third party to help him

1449
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
the process of doing a test or piece together a story

1450
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Therefore, in the process

1451
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
delayed the time he was able to obtain detention

1452
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
So the question you raised is a very crucial one.

1453
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
one question but

1454
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Then this key issue will be in the field of practice

1455
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Formation is sometimes a form for refugees

1456
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Further make things difficult for example

1457
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Ask him to keep repeating the things he went through

1458
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It can be a very painful experience for him

1459
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
or

1460
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
the truth of what he said

1461
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
make him helpless

1462
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
make him feel that he is not only not accepted

1463
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Even being further questioned and suspected

1464
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Then this may all be at the same scene

1465
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
A key issue in ethics

1466
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
But another level of problem

1467
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
is in this part of the story

1468
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Then this involves the process of writing the story.

1469
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
it is a collaboration

1470
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
For example, his narration was written down by another person

1471
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Or he worked hard in his own way

1472
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
talk about his experience

1473
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
But it may not be able to make everyone understand

1474
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Or in other words, there are many of these

1475
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
very strange thing

1476
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
let me give you an example

1477
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
In this Campo-Le

1478
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It is the refugee experience in Cambodia

1479
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
There is a saying that

1480
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,000
One of the sayings circulating as this refugee experience is that

1481
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
You have to plant a tree

1482
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It has a saying that is

1483
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
you need to

1484
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
planted like a tree

1485
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
That statement is incomprehensible to most people.

1486
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
People in the veins will find it strange

1487
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
what is like a tree

1488
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
So the explanation of these advances is that

1489
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
The reason to be like a tree

1490
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
it's because we're going to keep silent

1491
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
we will continue to grow

1492
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
But let's not touch the others

1493
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Don't let our language oppress us

1494
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Because during the process of fleeing in Cambodia,

1495
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Probably because of this, of course there are a lot of details

1496
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I can't speak very clearly and clearly now.

1497
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
but in simple terms

1498
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
If we plant this into a tree

1499
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
If it is a metaphor for the escape experience

1500
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
In fact, the ability to read these metaphors when we need them

1501
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Then this ability involves saying

1502
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
How do we contextualize the place where these metaphors take place

1503
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
How to provide the context of this pair of metaphors

1504
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
How to understand the context of these metaphors

1505
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,200
in the course of history

1506
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,920
The meaning in this historical context

1507
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,160
Then I think the most important possibility

1508
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,840
Back to the question of authenticity

1509
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,800
The fact is that we should not simply doubt

1510
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,520
should say so

1511
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,320
Let's not be too obsessed with judgments of authenticity

1512
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:19,520
because as an outsider

1513
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,680
In fact, it is difficult for you to judge the authenticity

1514
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,200
Right, if you're not the party

1515
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,240
if you haven't experienced

1516
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,880
If you have no other supporting materials

1517
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,360
I'm afraid it's hard for you to judge

1518
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,280
Is this story true or false?

1519
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,400
or in this story

1520
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,800
is there any exaggeration

1521
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:35,840
But what we want to hear is

1522
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,520
Or what we're going to read is in

1523
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,680
something beyond these rhetoric

1524
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,880
It doesn't matter if it's his heart

1525
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,240
Whether it's his trauma

1526
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:47,040
Whether it's some clues he wants to leave behind

1527
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,480
I think this is as a

1528
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,600
I think where we should pay attention

1529
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,240
instead of saying

1530
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,960
Because there's probably some exaggerated material here

1531
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,560
So he cannot be further adopted

1532
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,680
what i want to say is

1533
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,560
so i care

1534
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
stories about refugees

1535
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Actually, I just had a slideshow that didn't say anything in particular.

1536
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,600
That is, it is often a so-called future-tive history

1537
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,600
or future-tive documentation

1538
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,600
The records of these stories are actually very fragmented.

1539
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's all accidental in its retention

1540
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,400
So we actually need a lot of effort

1541
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,000
To piece together these fragmentary and incomplete ingredients

1542
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,400
And here we must run the risk of facing the real embarrassment

1543
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:35,000
So my advice would be to try to stay out of its sight

1544
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
trying to read between the lines

1545
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Rather than just grasping the so-called truth

1546
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
this is my simple answer

1547
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
ok sir

1548
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Hello teacher, this thank you very wonderful

1549
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And very, very responsible speeches

1550
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Usually in speeches I think of an issue like race in America

1551
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
just like black people

1552
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,900
They played the role of black slaves to Delamin

1553
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,960
So they're sort of a refugee.

1554
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,080
They also spent a lot of effort to fight for freedom.

1555
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:13,320
Then just know the racial inequality of black people now

1556
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,160
Or socioeconomic inequality is still a very, very big problem

1557
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:17,960
So I want to ask the teacher if

1558
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,400
This is actually quite

1559
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,880
quite

1560
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,360
I think it's pretty

1561
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,160
quite

1562
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,360
don't know how to solve

1563
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,400
That is, what kind of resettlement will refugees have in their new countries?

1564
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,400
how to make them follow

1565
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,680
how to make them better

1566
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,800
Do you have any opinions or indirect shares from the young teachers?

1567
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,080
ok thank you very much for this question

1568
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,080
I'm afraid it's a bit beyond my ability

1569
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,160
Sounds like such a huge mission to save Kasen

1570
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,320
But I think it's fair to say that

1571
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,080
racial issues

1572
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,120
Actually in this refugee story that I was trying to describe

1573
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,440
In fact, there is a side

1574
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,880
is the difference of identity

1575
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,200
This difference in identity may be racial

1576
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,640
probably an accent

1577
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,520
Maybe even today is a regional

1578
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,320
So it is not surprising that there are various differences in human society

1579
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,440
But the way we treat differences

1580
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,040
But it often adopts a method of exclusion and violence

1581
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,080
then this will be

1582
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,000
This should be our human society

1583
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,840
A question that should be constantly reflected on

1584
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,960
So back to that question about black people

1585
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,600
Or this question from ethnic minorities

1586
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,000
including the question of placement

1587
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,680
Here I think there are two aspects worth considering

1588
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,560
the first is

1589
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,280
Talk about the problem of placement

1590
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,800
In fact, there is an angle to say

1591
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,920
how do we bring him in

1592
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,800
So we, for example, through various

1593
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:41,280
Funding e.g. speaking language courses

1594
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,480
send them to language courses

1595
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,760
so that they can quickly integrate into the society

1596
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,400
So in this sense

1597
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,240
We are expecting these names to be us

1598
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,240
OK

1599
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,400
Then you should think about it

1600
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,400
We expect others to be us

1601
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,840
it sounds like nothing is wrong

1602
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,840
right

1603
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Right

1604
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Do you think this is not possible? Shouldn’t it be?

1605
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It doesn't sound like anything is wrong, does it?

1606
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Since you came to our country, you should

1607
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
when you're in Rome do what Romans do

1608
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
When you come to Rome, you have to learn how the Romans live

1609
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
But for Naming

1610
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
His coming may not be what he wants to come

1611
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
He was accidentally

1612
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Or because of these accidents that he couldn't resist

1613
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and came to this place

1614
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
then one

1615
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Police have a lot of help

1616
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But such a request or expectation

1617
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
he became what we imagined

1618
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
good no missiles

1619
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Then the well-behaved and kind Nai Ming

1620
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Even Nai Min, who is very grateful

1621
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
In fact, it is a big burden for him.

1622
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
So in the Naming study

1623
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It should be said that in the critique of Naming studies

1624
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
there is a big discussion

1625
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
In fact, for this debt

1626
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
It's just that Nai Ming has a feeling of apology

1627
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,560
This discussion because this debt reflects the

1628
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:04,600
His freedom was actually given

1629
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,900
His freedom is not what he fought for

1630
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,740
but because of these various external factors

1631
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,800
gave him such a free opportunity

1632
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,340
So he should survive

1633
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,160
This seems to be in line with our general social logic

1634
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,180
such an idea

1635
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,240
But when you go back to the refugee experience and history

1636
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,780
In the context of movement

1637
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:25,340
you'll find that for them

1638
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,140
That's actually a bigger burden

1639
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,500
As a result, we encounter many so-called

1640
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,780
This so-called immigrant group

1641
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:36,100
In fact, in the end, they are all regarded as people in this society.

1642
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,900
problem group

1643
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,680
But that problem is like what we have today

1644
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:41,480
Facing the child in exile

1645
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:42,500
so-called problem children

1646
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,580
Maybe that's not the problem with these kids and children

1647
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,880
It is the society that treats these children

1648
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,160
with the child

1649
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,700
face to face

1650
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:53,000
The expectations and requirements for them

1651
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,040
perhaps far beyond

1652
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:57,100
their burden

1653
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,580
then this is what i think

1654
01:15:58,580 --> 01:16:00,120
How to understand refugees

1655
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,820
between the receiving country

1656
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,120
Acceptance of a complex relationship between societies

1657
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,140
an ethical dimension

1658
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,700
Then of course race is a thing I think

1659
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,260
The very core question here

1660
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,800
why are they required

1661
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:14,080
because they're not like us

1662
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:16,900
so

1663
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,680
to eat pork like us

1664
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,740
come here to do something like us

1665
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,280
Well this is actually

1666
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,120
We don't see the context of their life

1667
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:26,880
What exactly is it

1668
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:29,960
So I think treating the other back to Derrida this time I just

1669
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,480
Sorry for not being able to

1670
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:32,520
expanded part

1671
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,320
When Derrida talked about Vietnam and Namibia

1672
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:36,360
he was talking about a

1673
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,140
is an unconditional Vietnamese

1674
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,960
It's that you can't ask him to do what he is

1675
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:42,240
You have to take it as it is

1676
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,780
he is like that

1677
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,820
and accept him that way

1678
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,620
so you can expand a

1679
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,180
Comparing the above relationship with ethical significance

1680
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:50,940
otherwise

1681
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,000
will always be in a so-called

1682
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,300
This humanity gives and

1683
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:59,100
In this expected exchange relationship with this harmonious society

1684
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,120
This is probably what I learned from reading refugee stories

1685
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,840
critical refugee studies

1686
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,640
One of the more important inspirations

1687
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,640
share with everyone

1688
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,140
Please say

1689
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:08,640
yes

1690
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:12,960
I am a family member

1691
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,200
The family of Wang Shijie

1692
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,480
I study economics and AI

1693
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,840
To that Microsoft today

1694
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,240
To learn some advanced OpenAI

1695
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,480
i mean now

1696
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,120
I heard the refugee story

1697
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,520
that

1698
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,080
Professor Wang gave me a lot

1699
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,440
Very

1700
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,240
Very

1701
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,080
deep impression

1702
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,160
But I want to ask a question is this

1703
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,120
Because I am Tzu Chi

1704
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,920
Some of us are brothers to help

1705
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:46,160
and

1706
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,320
that

1707
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,280
about Ukraine

1708
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,280
We are also going to pack

1709
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:52,800
to donate

1710
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,480
then we are in

1711
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,720
Syria also has

1712
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:00,040
that is

1713
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,800
We have a lot of seniors who have deep feelings over there.

1714
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:04,860
this kind

1715
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,400
that

1716
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:07,680
to feel

1717
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:09,720
I mean

1718
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,540
Professor Wang, do you want to say

1719
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,840
to experience

1720
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,640
go over there to see

1721
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:20,220
It's as if I followed my resignation hospital

1722
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,760
that one a while ago

1723
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:23,040
The dean of nursing told me

1724
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,060
say you

1725
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,860
Like we resigned people is not to

1726
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,680
Go to the hospital to feel the patients

1727
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,520
Feel it, feel it, there is a question later

1728
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:36,620
I can extend my academic problems later because I study economics

1729
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:37,640
This is

1730
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,200
Just like you are all academic

1731
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,500
But I've been slowly getting closer to that

1732
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,060
There are only two parts to the food.

1733
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,380
Talking about life and doing it

1734
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:50,700
Remember all living beings and save all living beings

1735
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,760
Then I mean, the next question comes, that is,

1736
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,920
Have you ever thought about the development of the aftermath?

1737
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,260
Refugees can become independent

1738
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,100
because some refugees

1739
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:08,100
He is a high intellectual like those in Ukraine

1740
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,100
They are capable only because they are refugees

1741
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,000
I don't want to be burdened by others

1742
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,400
so he is creative

1743
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,400
So we want to follow up

1744
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,200
is to train him to be useful

1745
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,600
So some of the latter we are

1746
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,100
in tzu chi

1747
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,400
they are at school

1748
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,500
then educate the child

1749
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,200
Then to derive from there is to say

1750
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:37,600
Dead refugees don't do harm to another country

1751
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,400
Accepting a burden is a burden

1752
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,800
but be creative

1753
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,100
and productive

1754
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,400
but also to promote their economic development

1755
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,200
Professor Wang, do you want to say that you want to experience it?

1756
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,900
grateful

1757
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,300
Thank you very much Mr. Li for this suggestion

1758
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,000
this i think

1759
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,000
OK, the vice president is here.

1760
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,600
Research institutes can also host groups

1761
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,600
In fact, I think for researchers

1762
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,100
it will be a very useful experience

1763
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:09,600
and then it will be a very real experience

1764
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,400
Then I myself am mainly in literature

1765
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,200
so i never had such a chance

1766
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,100
but if any

1767
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:22,900
I will also be willing to contact and try

1768
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,300
That's about what I'm going to say

1769
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,300
That is to say experience and contact

1770
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:32,900
and long-term relationship

1771
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,100
with refugees in our society

1772
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,100
or ethnic minorities or immigrants

1773
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,500
There will be some context here

1774
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,700
or the difference in state

1775
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:45,700
For example, if I go one day, two days, three days

1776
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,100
a week a month

1777
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,600
There are some very substantial differences here

1778
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,100
Let's say we have this

1779
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,300
friends who have been to refugee camps

1780
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,700
So when you go for a long time

1781
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,000
You're numb to those stories

1782
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,600
You'll cry at first

1783
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:02,760
then you feel

1784
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:03,620
here we go again

1785
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:05,000
ok

1786
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,800
then this is what i want

1787
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:07,640
just say

1788
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:08,600
Well

1789
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,360
this is not to say

1790
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,000
it's not an excuse not to go

1791
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,080
i didn't mean that

1792
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:12,500
that is

1793
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,760
head this here

1794
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,720
The specific context may be very important to our experience

1795
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,120
an important factor

1796
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:18,680
ok

1797
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,240
so uh

1798
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,280
so of course i

1799
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,920
support also uh

1800
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,200
willing to assist these

1801
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,080
various access and

1802
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,160
uh auxiliary

1803
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:28,240
but i think uh

1804
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,400
from a research point of view

1805
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,600
we'll have to think about it

1806
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,960
We are in this process when

1807
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,920
how did this process happen

1808
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,120
and in the process

1809
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,440
what is our status

1810
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,160
this is an uprising

1811
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,920
The rest is what you just mentioned

1812
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,200
These are all kinds of auxiliary methods.

1813
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,160
Well, of course I would agree

1814
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:44,840
If they can be productive and so on

1815
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,840
all good of course

1816
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:46,360
but this

1817
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,000
it's just us

1818
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,640
uh mainstream discourse

1819
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,880
what you have been expecting and imagining

1820
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,680
then this is also

1821
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,120
uh i think we're talking about these few today

1822
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,960
or weak one-by-one problems

1823
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,800
often difficult to overcome

1824
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,920
The mainstream imagination is very clear and clear

1825
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,320
and even have a high moral basis

1826
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,320
think you see we've helped you so much

1827
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,160
why don't you do it

1828
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,040
Then from the context of literature

1829
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,800
What I'm trying to do is a

1830
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,120
A certain kind of experience that destroys others as much as possible

1831
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,520
Can't say I'm totally capable of being the other

1832
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,640
But a certain experience and attempt to destroy the other

1833
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,240
may be what we want to provide to the society

1834
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:33,600
Some other thoughts outside of mainstream voices

1835
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,640
I don't think this is necessarily a Hange situation.

1836
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,680
It may just be an expansion or an addition

1837
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,000
But looking back, I feel that facing the refugee issue today

1838
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,800
Often people say that in Europe they say

1839
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,400
This is called humanitarian crisis

1840
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,240
humanitarian crisis

1841
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,200
But the problem is that there is a crisis, not humanity, right?

1842
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,200
These refugees aren't a crisis in themselves, are they?

1843
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,600
cause refugees

1844
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,420
The events of the crisis are actually the agents of the crisis

1845
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:06,180
Right, so back to the definition of a refugee?

1846
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,700
Refugees are those who cannot return home, or cannot return home

1847
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,780
So if we create a condition today where they can go home

1848
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:15,380
Is that the real solution to the refugee problem?

1849
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,780
The question is, can we create such conditions?

1850
01:23:18,780 --> 01:23:22,080
Then I think this is not just a face

1851
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,420
A state in which you want to solve a problem that has come before you

1852
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:29,040
but go one step further and go back

1853
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:33,940
What is the premise of reflecting on the whole construction problem

1854
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:38,420
That's what I think we hope to provide to the society

1855
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:40,380
not just go

1856
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:46,060
How to say, use the method of posting OK to solve a problem that has already

1857
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:49,620
Imminent problem Instead, put this imminent problem

1858
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,860
While solving the problem, we also think a little bit more deeply.

1859
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:57,060
See if it can be accessed from the root, or from a relatively large structure

1860
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:59,780
to reimagine and understand the problem

1861
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Maybe we'll get some different answers

1862
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,240
this female friend

1863
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,240
Maintain one man, one woman, one woman, one man

1864
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,240
so

1865
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,640
Hello Professor Wang

1866
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,280
I'm Shi Jiacheng

1867
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,520
I am a

1868
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,320
It's like a background engineer doing international aid

1869
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,920
just the staff

1870
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,520
i feel like i just

1871
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,520
I feel very grateful for today's speech

1872
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,520
Then

1873
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,520
I think I may have missed some information just now

1874
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,520
that is

1875
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,520
Professor Wang just mentioned

1876
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,520
in literature

1877
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,520
that is

1878
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:38,520
of these stories

1879
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,520
That's what I just heard a keyword

1880
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:41,520
is to tell these stories

1881
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,520
Maybe he was consumed

1882
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,520
or being

1883
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,520
is that there may be a need for a standard

1884
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,520
It's the story of a refugee

1885
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,520
or

1886
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,520
just mentioned some

1887
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,520
some different sketches

1888
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:55,520
such a picture of

1889
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,520
But I still don't quite understand

1890
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,520
These

1891
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,520
literary

1892
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,200
experience with this refugee

1893
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,640
Except for the eligibility of this refugee

1894
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,280
how to be identified

1895
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,600
for their freedom and dignity

1896
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,480
do you think this has any relationship

1897
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,080
yes this is the first question

1898
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,800
Then the second question is to say

1899
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,000
because from the food

1900
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,520
If we look at it from the point of view of food

1901
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,240
that is

1902
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,400
current refugee problem

1903
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,920
A more modern refugee problem

1904
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,040
maybe like climate refugees

1905
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,520
caused these crises in the mediterranean

1906
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,080
Then

1907
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:33,840
not a crisis

1908
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,320
that is

1909
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,400
It's Shah

1910
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,160
Northern Sahara

1911
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:38,960
Anyway it is

1912
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,400
Some of Africa's climate refugees

1913
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,200
is to Europe

1914
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:45,200
then the crisis in syria

1915
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:46,760
and then

1916
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,640
like yemen

1917
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,680
or some longer-term issues

1918
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,200
Or maybe even like the earthquake in Türkiye

1919
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,200
Then something like this happens

1920
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,760
you just mentioned

1921
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:00,120
In fact, most of them are low-to-medium

1922
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,660
Developing countries host the most refugees

1923
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:04,860
I can understand that

1924
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,580
literature just can take a while

1925
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,420
just might be

1926
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,340
These are the ones integrated into the society

1927
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,900
created by descendants of refugees

1928
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:17,860
But what I want to understand is to say

1929
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:19,580
Are you doing this research for

1930
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:22,300
some of the current refugees

1931
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:26,700
Event is what kind of thought?

1932
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:27,700
Thanks

1933
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,120
very happy

1934
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,200
There are many friends from the food industry here today

1935
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,320
so i was a little surprised

1936
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,640
but also very happy

1937
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,200
Because obviously we're in this society

1938
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,360
There's a lot actually on this subject

1939
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,600
have many devoted friends

1940
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,440
Then I think two questions

1941
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,840
Simply put

1942
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,520
The previous question was about the story itself

1943
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,040
how about these stories

1944
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,920
some of these stories

1945
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:56,280
what should i say

1946
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,040
its typicality or its exemplary

1947
01:26:59,040 --> 01:26:59,920
become a

1948
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
The kind of consumption I just mentioned in the speech

1949
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,500
consumption of spectacle

1950
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:09,000
That part is for

1951
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,500
As for how the refugees themselves are subject to the image of these refugees

1952
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,000
critique and analysis

1953
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:22,000
That is to say, many refugees may feel that they are being forced into a

1954
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
or should i say

1955
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
be compelled or said to be expected to perform a

1956
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
good refugee such an image

1957
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
This also contains some brave qualities

1958
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,500
contains some gentle qualities

1959
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:36,500
Contains some of these traits of tolerance to trauma

1960
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:43,000
But not every refugee can fully present such a trait

1961
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
But we will in these existing stories

1962
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
To understand or recognize and construct a basic concept for refugees

1963
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
thoughts and status

1964
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So this imaginary or constructed image

1965
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
with the actual

1966
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,820
Is there a kind of experience

1967
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,680
Consideration

1968
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,980
You have to meet this thing before I can accept you

1969
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,060
Or will he form an oppressive relationship?

1970
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,880
Because it's like this, I can't match it

1971
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,420
how i have to

1972
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,960
Then this is what I want in this research

1973
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,000
trying to

1974
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,040
just one of the opening

1975
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:23,560
OK

1976
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,860
That is to say, we are often

1977
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:29,440
Often in the narrative, it actually regulates our

1978
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:31,740
Acceptable and understandable range

1979
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,260
OK

1980
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:33,800
The other one actually returns

1981
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,580
the food problem

1982
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,400
Of course I have no actual food experience so it's hard to get in

1983
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,680
food above

1984
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,480
make a nice response

1985
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,780
But what I can probably say is that

1986
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:47,880
to Ukraine

1987
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:49,920
Take Ukraine as an example

1988
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,000
western fast

1989
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,800
Receiving Ukrainian refugees with open arms

1990
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,620
But from 2013 to 15 years

1991
01:28:58,620 --> 01:28:59,860
The Syrian Refugee Crisis

1992
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Up to now, virtual nanometer has still become a

1993
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Issues not adequately addressed within Europe

1994
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
How to explain the difference here

1995
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Or how to make the difference here

1996
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Let's see what exactly causes these differences

1997
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Then this is probably facing reality

1998
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
one may not be a good answer

1999
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
But that is to say, if we face the reality with courage

2000
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I think the critical thinking provided in the research

2001
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
In fact, it may not be impossible to put it in a real field to test

2002
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Maybe we might be talking too much about these thoughts

2003
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Then reality can slap us in the face and tell us that's not the case

2004
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Then we'd love to take a reality check, too.

2005
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
But it is also possible that such a presupposition or imagination

2006
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It is possible that in this real experience

2007
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
help us see something different

2008
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Of course we are also very happy

2009
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
In this sense, I think it is actually necessary

2010
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
The academia and the food industry have more cooperation and expectations

2011
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
In the past, we worked on the issue of migrant workers

2012
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
In fact, there are many cooperations in the food industry

2013
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
But in Naiming because of his international nature

2014
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Relationships are also less accessible

2015
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
This may require more efforts from us

2016
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
thank you very much for your question

2017
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
You are the gentleman in front of this society

2018
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
our last three questions

2019
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
The first one

2020
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
hello i'm a biology student

2021
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
So I guess the first thing we think

2022
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
We are all struggling for survival

2023
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
all creatures are the same

2024
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And the second thing that always comes to my mind is

2025
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
franklin once said

2026
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
That is, if you are unwilling to pay any obligation for freedom

2027
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
this man does not deserve to be free

2028
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
then my question

2029
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,500
Once when I was arguing with someone

2030
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:07,000
I say that maybe it's offensive to some people

2031
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,500
But I think Ms. Nongyuntai also said

2032
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,500
Dajiang Dahai is a refugee

2033
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:17,000
I said it was just refugees with guns

2034
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,500
He told me that if you wear a gun, you are not a refugee.

2035
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:22,500
I want to ask the teacher

2036
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,000
if i give up defending myself today

2037
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
to be a refugee

2038
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
or am i a refugee today

2039
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
But I'm willing to pick up a gun and defend myself

2040
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I can get out of refugee status

2041
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
good question

2042
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,500
Looks like the gift from today's seminar is pretty good

2043
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:49,000
So everyone's questions are very enthusiastic.

2044
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
let me put it this way

2045
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
If we go back to the previous UN-related definitions

2046
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Refugees have nothing to do with having a gun or not

2047
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
But that doesn't mean it doesn't matter that the refugees who are asking for trouble won't matter.

2048
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
or a knife

2049
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Right

2050
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
creatures need to survive

2051
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
The creature will find his way out

2052
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,000
This is what I think everyone can agree with and accept.

2053
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
But to what extent do creatures

2054
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
to save his life

2055
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
or expand his livelihood

2056
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I think there is an ethical issue here

2057
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
OK that

2058
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
We generally think of refugees as victims, right?

2059
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Right

2060
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
But Erlan told us

2061
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
How to escape the image of the victim

2062
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Make yourself famous first

2063
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
how to become famous

2064
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
you are going to steal

2065
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It's good to go to the robber

2066
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
it doesn't matter

2067
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
as long as i can

2068
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
was seen

2069
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
my voice can be heard

2070
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I can how

2071
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
will be able to

2072
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
have this condition to discuss my rights

2073
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
that's where i want to go

2074
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Consider that

2075
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Is there an ethic in being a refugee?

2076
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
That sounds weird too, doesn't it?

2077
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
you already

2078
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
You are already a refugee, what ethics are you talking about?

2079
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,320
but this is not

2080
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:05,840
Do you mean being a refugee?

2081
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:07,560
no more ethics?

2082
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,560
It's weird not to say the other way around, isn't it?

2083
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:10,440
So

2084
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,320
So I think your question

2085
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,640
Of course, there is a very realistic context and context in Taiwan.

2086
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,360
this part i

2087
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:18,760
I

2088
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:21,800
Let me put it this way, let me not touch him so directly

2089
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,840
But I come and go in the opposite direction

2090
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,240
The way to discuss this would probably be to say

2091
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:28,760
Um

2092
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,000
when we have

2093
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,280
Enter

2094
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,720
When in a situation where you might become a refugee

2095
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,080
Well

2096
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,800
Whether to hold a gun or not may already be another question.

2097
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:40,920
Come

2098
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,560
what we hope is

2099
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:43,720
such an experience

2100
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,560
Don't happen to us though it sounds selfish

2101
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,880
as if someone else

2102
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:49,720
It doesn't matter if you're a refugee, but we don't want

2103
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,200
but instead of saying

2104
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,560
When we can not go through this situation

2105
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,280
or when we hope not to go through such a journey

2106
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,920
what should we do now

2107
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,000
then i think

2108
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,160
So this has nothing to do with holding a gun

2109
01:34:03,380 --> 01:34:04,400
not completely irrelevant

2110
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:07,500
But not so directly a cozorelation

2111
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,540
With a gun, of course, you can kill a bloody road, right?

2112
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:15,160
barely say so

2113
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,620
But what kind of road will the bloody road be?

2114
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,040
Is it the way to live

2115
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,700
This is also what I think many of the refugee stories provide us with a

2116
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:27,720
Very different or bloody inspirations and experiences

2117
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,760
So I think I'll answer this question for now

2118
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,120
hope you are satisfied

2119
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,480
If you are not satisfied, we can discuss it in private.

2120
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,260
ok thanks

2121
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,120
The last two questions this classmate

2122
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,440
The classmate in white clothes

2123
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,040
Hello, teacher. I am the candidate for the blood test.

2124
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:48,920
then want to ask

2125
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,520
There have been extreme terrorist attacks in Europe in recent years

2126
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,040
It's all about refugees

2127
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,760
Let me tell you the truth, if it happened in Taiwan

2128
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:00,000
Personally, I'd be terrified of refugees

2129
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
So what kind of mentality should we have in order to trust the refugee group?

2130
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And let's get this stereotype out of our minds

2131
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
because the fact is that it happened

2132
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Mr. Xie

2133
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
This problem is mainly a hero out of a teenager

2134
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
So the tough question comes from the youngest questioner

2135
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
this stuff is really hard

2136
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I think this is of course also challenging our bottom line as human beings, right?

2137
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That is, assuming your freshman experience was such an encounter

2138
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And it is a clear relationship

2139
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
For example, tell me something about me

2140
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
It's because of this that he was sacrificed or injured.

2141
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Of course, that is a very clear signal to you, right?

2142
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:55,000
then you'd like to say that you can keep those dangers or fears out of the equation

2143
01:35:55,000 --> 01:36:00,000
that but i think on the one hand

2144
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Is that so?

2145
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,600
If the history you just told is true

2146
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,600
I can't remember now

2147
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:10,600
is it true

2148
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,600
but suppose you

2149
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,300
just say

2150
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:13,400
i believe what you say is true

2151
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,200
Then I can probably just say

2152
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,200
Not every refugee is a terrorist

2153
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,400
Another one is to say

2154
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,600
What is the context of these things?

2155
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,400
How do we understand that these things happened

2156
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:26,700
not just focus or focus on

2157
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,100
those who caused these events

2158
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:30,900
identity of the author

2159
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:33,100
because these identities are probably the easiest to identify

2160
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:33,900
easiest to see

2161
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:36,000
easiest to pick out

2162
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,800
as different from us

2163
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,700
that part

2164
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,400
to be noticed

2165
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,600
But perhaps more importantly

2166
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:44,500
what caused

2167
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,100
This specific identity and group

2168
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,600
to carry out such a

2169
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,500
The tragedy we don't want to see

2170
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:50,900
then this may be

2171
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:53,400
I feel that in all encounters

2172
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,200
when tragic events

2173
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,400
We should all actually think about it

2174
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,600
But at 911

2175
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,000
In fact, there was a big

2176
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,600
Reflection Except within the United States

2177
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:05,200
Everyone is very anti-terrorism outside

2178
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,600
More often people think of

2179
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,800
Why did these people suddenly come to America

2180
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,200
What the United States is doing in the Middle East

2181
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,800
make these so-called terrorists

2182
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:20,400
All were able to enter the United States through the US security check.

2183
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:26,200
even acquired these resources and capabilities for military operations

2184
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,700
I think it's something else

2185
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:31,800
The direction we should ask and pursue

2186
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,600
thanks then our last question

2187
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,400
Mr. Society, wear a mask, Mr. Society

2188
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,400
Hello teacher, thank you very much for your speech today

2189
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,500
Brilliant and then I have a question

2190
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:47,000
It just happened to be in my heart for a while

2191
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,400
Then just because of the princess, a friend of mine went

2192
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,400
He is a reporter from Taiwan

2193
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,200
Then he himself became very interested in refugee issues

2194
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,800
So he spent a lot of time in these years

2195
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,200
Find ways to interview and research countries around the world

2196
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,560
That includes Syria, Ukraine

2197
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,640
Then there is the African country Afghanistan and so on

2198
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,900
Then there are South American

2199
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:07,940
Then

2200
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,240
And because I'm friends with him

2201
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,540
so i have seen him write something

2202
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,620
Of course there are some things that we can understand

2203
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:18,180
Then there are many things that just echo the teacher's question

2204
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:21,000
In fact, the issue he wanted to discuss happened to be a lecture with the teacher today.

2205
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,520
The theme is like

2206
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:25,860
Refugees aren't just one or two stereotypes actually

2207
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,160
It's not that he actually has various faces

2208
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,980
These appearances are all in the mainstream media or

2209
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,280
interests outside political ideology

2210
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,840
Then his writing is the multi-headed appearance he wants to present.

2211
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:40,960
But I am particularly fond of the two characters in his record

2212
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,500
speech to

2213
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,280
special interest is

2214
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:51,460
What surprises me about these two is that they say they are refugees but they are true to themselves

2215
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:55,040
Dare to fight for rights or what he deserves

2216
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,120
That one is like you just mentioned

2217
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:00,160
One of them is a Syrian refugee

2218
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,640
He saw the Ukrainian name in Europe

2219
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,480
When you are taken care of relatively warmly

2220
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,720
when accepting

2221
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,040
he is very angry

2222
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,800
He said why the same European country

2223
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,520
Much better for Ukraine than us

2224
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,160
He was very angry for asking

2225
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:15,440
of course no answer

2226
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,760
But it's surprising to me that it says

2227
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,800
Of course it's also the other way around

2228
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,320
Forcing myself to challenge my own cognition

2229
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:24,680
I just wanted to say what's so weird about it

2230
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,800
they are european countries

2231
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,800
There is also a Christian civilization

2232
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:27,960
same white complexion

2233
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,680
then to

2234
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:32,640
But he doesn't think that's a reason

2235
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:36,480
He angrily questioned

2236
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,160
And then another example is a guy from Neglia

2237
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,200
He is actually strictly speaking

2238
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,880
not your typical refugee

2239
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,120
He is going to study in England

2240
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:47,440
But since then it happened to him that he had a disease

2241
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,280
that disease if he goes back to negilia

2242
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,600
There is no way to get proper care

2243
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,360
because his brother died

2244
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:56,240
So there seems to be a law in the UK that says

2245
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,800
You can stay in the UK for medical reasons

2246
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,000
but

2247
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,760
However, due to various technical problems

2248
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,860
He was not accepted by the British government

2249
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:07,160
So he went to court with the British government for many years

2250
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,000
Then in this interview he said

2251
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,560
He complained that he thought the British government had not properly

2252
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,360
give him his due rights

2253
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,660
So he angrily criticized the British government

2254
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,460
And he also has the support of a lot of Britons

2255
01:40:19,460 --> 01:40:21,000
I feel that the British government is not doing a good job.

2256
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,780
should give him the right

2257
01:40:22,780 --> 01:40:26,880
Caused him to pretend to be a youth to go to court

2258
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,460
Normal life and due development are thus on the wheel

2259
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,760
Then I got curious and said

2260
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,840
Why is this guy not actually a British citizen?

2261
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,380
Not a citizen of Ukraine or any other country

2262
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:39,160
But he thinks he can have

2263
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:41,720
great right to demand even he can criticize

2264
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:43,780
Then also got a case like the British

2265
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:45,320
He is also supported by British citizens

2266
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,360
Seems like the Guardian also reported his case.

2267
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:49,920
I'm just curious, why?

2268
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,460
These refugees feel that they have

2269
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,240
That power and right

2270
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,520
Then another reason is

2271
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,800
Another question is that

2272
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,820
Is it true that European countries have developed a

2273
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,760
A new discourse looks at the matter of citizenship

2274
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,000
so that as you just discussed is to say

2275
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,800
like A'olan would criticize

2276
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,920
If you don't have citizenship you don't have human rights

2277
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,560
that sovereignty

2278
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,120
Should human rights and sovereignty be tied together?

2279
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:15,920
Or in fact, European countries can do better

2280
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,880
Then you mentioned a little bit

2281
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:19,560
The latest discussion of that in Europe

2282
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:22,960
But can the teacher be there more?

2283
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,080
Let’s talk a little more about the past few years in Europe

2284
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:28,560
Discussion on the relationship between human rights and refugees

2285
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,800
Is there some new development like this?

2286
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:31,280
Thanks

2287
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:36,000
OK, I will simply add something like this

2288
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:36,960
the first is

2289
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,640
The refugee problem is in Europe as in America as in Asia

2290
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:44,560
is a very different configuration

2291
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:45,280
OK

2292
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:47,960
Well, in Europe I think there is a special place

2293
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,080
because it is the eu

2294
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,720
So when refugees come in

2295
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:56,720
It really only needs to be accepted

2296
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,840
it may be conditioned to be able to move

2297
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,400
Or he may also choose to speak to him

2298
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,480
Conditions will be better to move

2299
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,240
OK, then this is what I want in the real thing

2300
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,440
Some examples we can see

2301
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,120
that means he's here

2302
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,760
For example, he crossed the Mediterranean from Syria

2303
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:16,880
came to greece

2304
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,600
In fact, it is because Greece is relatively easy to get to.

2305
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:20,560
in many senses

2306
01:42:20,720 --> 01:42:23,840
And it's a route that's been traveled many times

2307
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,920
So here we can actually see

2308
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:28,400
Refugees have some knowledge accumulation

2309
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,160
Is he has long the path of this refugee

2310
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,200
Formed a whole set of this process

2311
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:36,720
if we may say so

2312
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,280
Then this process includes our selection

2313
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,840
It's where the refugees choose to settle.

2314
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,120
where to move

2315
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:45,520
and where to get the identity

2316
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:47,120
some different options like this

2317
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,600
including this one we were just talking about about North Korea

2318
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,400
When this experience of North Korean defectors

2319
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,320
In fact, many North Korean defectors, of course

2320
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:55,600
I want to go to South Korea

2321
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,200
Then he opened his hands at the beginning

2322
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:58,160
hug these defectors

2323
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,080
Because this can prove that South Korea is

2324
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,740
It is the most reasonable and legal representative of the two Korean governments, right?

2325
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:06,340
This is very exhausting for the relationship between the two Koreas.

2326
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:08,840
But because too many people came

2327
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,560
So the governments of the two Koreas feel that this will create another kind of fear and crisis

2328
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:16,960
So he started shutting down the flow of North Korean defectors into South Korea.

2329
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,600
This made it impossible for these North Korean defectors to leave smoothly.

2330
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,940
From Taiwan to North Korea to China and then to South Korea

2331
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:25,740
So he started moving elsewhere

2332
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,740
So what I'm going to say is to go back to your question

2333
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:31,040
A very core place in it is

2334
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:33,640
Refugees are not people without knowledge

2335
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:36,740
This is the first one I think we should be very aware of

2336
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:39,140
That is, refugees are not only people without knowledge

2337
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:43,340
And they probably have a whole lot of knowledge about fleeing

2338
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:45,240
we don't have

2339
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,140
So when I read topics related to refugee studies

2340
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:52,540
I was surprised that when many refugees fled

2341
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,840
is wearing a mobile phone

2342
01:43:54,940 --> 01:43:56,640
Then there are cell phones so you have GPS

2343
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,740
then where can how how how how how how

2344
01:43:58,740 --> 01:43:59,940
then this is

2345
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,340
The thing we didn't think about when we wanted refugees before

2346
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:06,140
So I think the part about keeping pace with the times

2347
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:08,140
Actually in Europe

2348
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:11,780
The first one, of course, is that the understanding of refugees keeps pace with the times.

2349
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,340
In addition, in Europe because of such a state

2350
01:44:14,340 --> 01:44:16,340
So Europe is constantly

2351
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:18,340
The more progressive person

2352
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:19,700
What is actually being discussed is

2353
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:23,820
How do we carry out a so-called all-European management

2354
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:27,660
Don't let all the refugees go through it, let's say italy

2355
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:29,180
or among them in greece

2356
01:44:29,340 --> 01:44:31,340
can share

2357
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,840
Shared among EU countries

2358
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:37,340
Form a mechanism to enable these people to have a suitable placement

2359
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:41,340
I understand that this is still under discussion

2360
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:45,180
Such a proposition actually encountered a lot of backlash.

2361
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:48,620
Maybe Germany is comparatively speaking

2362
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:52,140
Welcome is a country that is more willing to tolerate and accept

2363
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:57,340
But some other countries may not be so willing, like Italy

2364
01:44:57,340 --> 01:44:59,500
so here maybe

2365
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,920
Probably have to go back to the whole EU

2366
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:05,440
Some special situations in each country

2367
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:08,800
come to understand these

2368
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,200
Individual country situation relative to refugee movements

2369
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:14,600
I think this is probably what I can provide

2370
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,160
Simply add like this

2371
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,040
thanks for your question

2372
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,200
well thank you very much for this tonight

2373
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:24,200
Professor Wang gave us a wonderful speech

2374
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,600
offers us much to reflect on

2375
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:29,640
So let's applaud him now

2376
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,640
Thanks

2377
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,640
Thanks

2378
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:37,640
Thank you very much for your participation
