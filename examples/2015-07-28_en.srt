applause

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Our feast of knowledge tonight

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Our monthly feast of knowledge

13
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,520
I am very happy to invite the director of our physics institute today

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,200
Director Li Dingguo

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,880
He is also a Special Review Researcher of the Institute

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,440
Director Li was born in 1976

17
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:26,360
Ph.D. from Brown University

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,320
He was also at Virginia Tech

19
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,520
after a while

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,560
and then back to Taiwan

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,840
He has been back to Taiwan for a long time

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,320
I believe everyone in academia knows him

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,600
Also served in the hospital

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,920
Executive Secretary of our Academic Association

25
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,920
This is an academic program within the Chancellery

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And review and so on

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
at the National Science Council

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
which is now the Ministry of Science and Technology

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He also served as the director of the Theory Center

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Program host at the Nano Center, etc.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dr. Li has also won the membership of the Physical Society of the Republic of China

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Also a meeting of the British Physical Society

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Also a meeting of the American Physical Society

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Needless to say, he has won numerous awards

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We have the Outstanding Honor Award of Houjindui in China

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
National Science Council Outstanding Research Award

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And the Outstanding Talent Award from the Outstanding Talent Foundation, etc.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then I always say that our basic science

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To say that everyone knows

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is working very hard

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,680
But every time we look for a speaker

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
satisfies power

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I believe

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
Although everyone read the topic today, it seems a bit

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,800
Seeking to generate higher overheating

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,600
Mechanism of superconducting temperature

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,200
high temperature superconductivity

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
I believe everyone has heard of this term

50
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,120
he is trying to put

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,560
whole process mechanism

52
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,120
to tell everyone

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,000
I think

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,320
We use these two hours

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,120
I believe

56
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
Director must

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,280
Let everyone know how this high-temperature superconductivity came about

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
the future potential

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
future

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
this

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
practical application

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
people say you can see

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
He has already placed a resignation in front of this

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,600
Our goal is to say

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,440
this resignation train

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Actually now

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Already have how to take a step further

68
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,200
I believe we will gain a lot tonight

69
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,720
We welcome Director Li

70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
Thank you Vice President Wang

71
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,720
Thank you all for coming to the party tonight

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,580
This is just now Vice President Wang also said that this is a big challenge

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,120
because it's me

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,640
first

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,920
to use

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,760
Talk about the superconducting mechanism in a popular speech

77
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,360
This is something that everyone may have heard of but may not know about superconductivity.

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,760
The reason why I took this name was because of the magic I thought about this research topic is

79
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,820
most interested have done

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,860
decades of this

81
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,400
Superconducting

82
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,720
The problem is this is what I've been looking for

83
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,520
an important direction

84
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Then today I may try to share with you why this topic is very

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,300
very interesting very challenging

86
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,000
So how can we gain some new understanding of physics

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,300
So here's what I'm talking about today

88
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,100
The main thing is to talk first, of course talk a little bit

89
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,900
What exactly is directed? What does it mean?

90
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,200
It may be more than you imagine

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,800
And a little more strange phenomenon

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
with some of its mechanics is very simple

93
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,500
Why do we have so many strange phenomena

94
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,300
But if you know something about this

95
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,700
you can imagine what it does

96
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,100
You may hear more about this

97
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,800
That is the aspect of the possible application of the steering material

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,700
that's been done a lot

99
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,500
The other one, of course, is what Wang Fuyuan said just now.

100
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,700
The discovery of this high-temperature conductor

101
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,300
Near the end of 1986

102
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,700
almost 30 years now

103
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,900
the discovery of this

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,300
a lot of confusion

105
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,340
that's confusing we're still trying to understand

106
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,000
don't already have quite a few close

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,840
To understand the cause of this problem

108
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
With the source of this tide island

109
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Well we just discovered a lot

110
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,840
It's not the same as the old tide island

111
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Then of course the next step is

112
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,840
How to find higher tide temperature

113
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,540
Then of course why seek this

114
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,840
I have quite a big idea with this

115
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,840
OK, let's talk about this tide island phenomenon

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Of course, the English name of this Superconductor is Superconductor

117
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Calling this name, of course, ordinary people will think of it as one.

118
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
This English conductor has several opinions

119
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,840
One is the conductor and the other is the length of the vehicle

120
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,840
If the conductor of the train is also called conductor

121
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
The other one is the conductor, the conductor of the orchestra.

122
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Then this Super is of course Superman

123
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
This Superconductor is what it means

124
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Then there is another kind of Taiwan that everyone is more familiar with.

125
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Well done called Semiconductor

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,120
there is a comic

127
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Let’s say this conductor only has work part time

128
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
So it is semiconductor

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,680
Of course with SumSent is also right

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,000
This semiconductor will see its resistance later

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,760
part of it is like conducting

132
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,880
sometimes not like

133
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,000
So it is a general semiconductor

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,880
the name goes

135
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,240
Then this superconductor

136
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,360
when he takes a good name

137
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,440
Dangdang doesn't sound very familiar

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,920
what does super mean

139
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,360
what about this gentleman

140
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
is honest

141
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,080
this is dutch

142
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,280
At the University of Leiden

143
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,520
in 1911

144
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,880
about 100 years ago

145
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,920
In 1911, he conducted an experiment

146
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,040
Of course he wasn't

147
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,240
especially to find

148
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,760
This super early experiment

149
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,800
this is a resistor

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,600
let me explain

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,280
What does this resistor mean?

152
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,320
This is the resistance represented by the OMU

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Its special experiment is that it can reduce the temperature to a very low

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It is a liquid state, but it turns into a liquid state at 4.2 degrees

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Above 4.2 degrees it is gaseous

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It can make liquid damage

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that is its most important job

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
After this work it is done

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It puts some metals and other things in the low temperature to see

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
what happened

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This approach is often a scientific approach

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's just going to a place that no one else has been to.

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
See questions that people have never seen before

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Of course the problem is the low temperature

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Occurs at very low temperatures

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Of course, low temperature is very important now.

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This whole is under low temperature and it goes to measure

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It this resistance of course from high temperature

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This 270 degrees can be 273 degrees

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So this is about 269 degrees

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Just -269 degrees facility

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Zero degrees at our facility is

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
273 degrees absolute

174
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,760
This is the absolute temperature

175
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,840
So you are now saying that from this room temperature all the way down

176
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,800
You're going to get down to about 300 degrees

177
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,800
you can get to this temperature

178
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,320
Absolute temperature below 0 degrees is no temperature

179
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,040
This temperature has an absolute value

180
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,960
is 0 degrees

181
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,880
it keeps cooling

182
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,520
Then watch the resistor drop all the way down

183
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,000
to here

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,480
suddenly fell fast

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,400
down to 3 orders of magnitude 4 orders of magnitude

186
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,320
Negatives from here to 10

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,440
fall here

188
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,000
then 4.15 degrees

189
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
It can be seen here that 4.2 degrees

190
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,160
just too high

191
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,000
a little lower temperature

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,040
So too high is very important

193
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,800
put it in

194
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,520
it's lower

195
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:41,800
Eh

196
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,200
it got

197
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,280
this phenomenon

198
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
this is

199
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,720
superconducting

200
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
found for the first time

201
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,960
This is 1911

202
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,400
You will probably see this picture many times

203
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,080
this is

204
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,120
This temperature is called the part temperature Tc

205
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,000
C is

206
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,680
English is called Critical Temperature

207
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,840
is the part temperature

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,160
The Tc I used in this talk is the representative

209
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,240
just go from normal to super old temperature

210
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,280
What we are looking for is to increase the temperature

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,840
best to mention room temperature

212
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
this is everyone's dream

213
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
Of course it is asking why

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
This zero resistance is of course here you see

215
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Its resistance is not zero

216
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
It is also a real parent, a real mother

217
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
Just good resistance

218
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,120
not exactly zero

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,760
How do we know this is zero resistance

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
After this material comes out

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Of course it slowly started to become popular in cryogenics

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
so many people do

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
it is

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Then from just now what it does is mercury

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is the arch

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
then there is lead

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
These materials one by one

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then first do single-atom metals in the periodic table

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Then do the bimetallic

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
alloy of two elements

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
do it

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
do here almost

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
almost

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,540
Then later do three elements

235
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,340
you can tell

236
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,840
The physicist starts from the simplest kind of element

237
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,120
Then do two more elements

238
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,420
make three elements

239
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,460
start looking for

240
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
Say the superconducting temperature

241
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,920
So doing here is actually the highest at that time

242
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,880
23 degrees

243
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,160
I was doing a postdoc at the time

244
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,960
I'll study this when I do

245
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,080
Why is the superconducting temperature 23 degrees?

246
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,260
Back then I called it a high temperature superconductor

247
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,080
Of course it looks funny now

248
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,580
That's only 23 degrees absolute temperature

249
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,920
At that time, this material was also difficult to make.

250
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
Only one group can make it

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,920
that is a world record

252
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,580
back then i remember in ganis

253
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,500
It is also written in the world record

254
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,120
This is the world's highest temperature superconductor

255
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,620
23 degrees

256
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,820
that's a big deal

257
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,380
then this is

258
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,040
After that, of course, new materials started to come out.

259
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,080
but it's too late

260
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,700
At that time in 1970

261
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,660
At that time we were the earth

262
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,580
The material is also interesting

263
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,840
but at that time

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,300
Everyone do this temperature

265
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,140
This was 4 years ago in 2011

266
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,540
This is a British magazine

267
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,340
journal of physics

268
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,900
published a special issue

269
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,540
100 Years of Drilling Development

270
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,500
just said

271
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,140
The words developed in the past 100 years

272
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,460
Of course there are some

273
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,240
Nuo Biao said it was related to this drill

274
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,840
In fact, the first person is of course

275
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,840
It's that Mr. Ones just now

276
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,240
campman

277
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,940
Now at University Leiden

278
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,780
There is a Museum

279
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,200
If you go to University Leiden

280
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,140
that is very old

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,580
300+ Years of University

282
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,980
There is a laboratory in that university

283
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,040
There is this Museum

284
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
dedicated to his cryogenic laboratory

285
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,180
That is the most famous cryogenic laboratory in the world

286
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,140
He spoke with a promise

287
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,800
In fact, it is not because of the discovery of the manipulation

288
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,380
It's because he lowered the temperature to one too high

289
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,740
this is

290
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,240
Sorry I didn't translate

291
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,540
This is the original promise

292
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,980
Citation when Community gave him a promise

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
not about coaching

294
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,520
Because at that time, I didn't understand manipulation at all.

295
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,800
Back then there was no quantum physics

296
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,840
I don't know what that means

297
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,560
wait a minute and you'll think about it

298
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,360
so don't appreciate at all

299
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,080
And at that time, they were also speculating on the teacher's parents

300
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,440
Sifang shopkeeper is not a spirit

301
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
what's special

302
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,360
There are of course many explanations for this

303
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
So this is probably when

304
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,920
But in 1972 this paper

305
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,040
Of course it is a theoretical paper

306
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
explains the phenomenon of manipulation

307
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
This is written by water

308
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,560
after this comes out

309
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,640
The overall understanding of manipulation is greatly increased

310
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,600
That's an important theory

311
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,040
a breakthrough theory

312
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,200
So it's actually the same as the discovery of the God Particle

313
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,360
everything matters

314
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,840
This theory has far-reaching

315
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,720
Many developments in high-energy particle physics

316
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,080
the two

317
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,280
Even three of them are also physicists

318
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,640
Same County NOW WebPly 1973

319
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,280
I also saw some manipulative phenomena

320
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,080
special phenomenon

321
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
Of course I won't talk about this, just 90 points a piece

322
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,160
One of the books that this gentleman gave is that he is doing a Ph.D.

323
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,760
Dissertation written during PhD studentship

324
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,200
His teacher is a very famous physicist

325
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
A question came up during class

326
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,680
Said the question is very interesting

327
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,480
do it and see what happens

328
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,720
He just did it and made a promise

329
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,280
This is the simplest paper I have ever seen

330
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,880
Of course he has great consequence

331
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,360
These are the two who discovered high temperature very early in 1987

332
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,480
Bennel's Swiss and German Mueller

333
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,000
Take the promise

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,520
Three more in 2003 with two Russians

335
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,840
Because the American professor took the promise

336
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
it's all about theory

337
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,800
So there are two related to the theory

338
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,120
out of twelve

339
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,600
Ten are related to experiments

340
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
wait some people i will mention

341
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,880
not all

342
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,680
First we have to remind

343
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,080
Because everyone may go to college for a long time

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,320
Probably a long time ago or in high school what is a resistor

345
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,440
Let's take a look at what zero resistance means

346
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,200
Resistors are actually very simple

347
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,720
take a material

348
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
Then you add a direct current like

349
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,440
add a battery

350
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,240
Current flows from positive to negative

351
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,760
That's what we both said

352
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,480
Just put a Ford battery

353
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,200
Then how many tenths of an ampere do I have

354
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,000
I divide it and I am my resistor

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,600
That resistance is just ohms

356
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,920
But this is of course a bit simple

357
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,320
because this thing has a problem

358
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,800
Let's say that if the length becomes longer

359
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,440
If say the length of this conductor is doubled

360
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,480
Then of course we are as small as water

361
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,680
if you manage to double

362
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,760
your flow is reduced by half

363
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,240
Cut the current in half

364
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,880
then you double the resistance

365
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
because you cut this in half

366
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,720
If the entire value remains unchanged

367
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,040
you just doubled

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,300
this resistor

369
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,500
Then if you take this area

370
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,300
double doubled

371
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,700
then the current doubles

372
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,400
we all know that

373
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
If the tube is doubled

374
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,500
the flow of water doubles it

375
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,600
Then the resistance is reduced by half

376
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
So the resistor itself acts as a

377
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,900
It depends on the length and area of ​​the material

378
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,100
It will be different if you measure it

379
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,200
Although both take the same line

380
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,800
coarse wire fine wire

381
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,700
length you will get different

382
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,200
so it's not a good number

383
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,900
because it will experiment with everyone

384
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,600
The amount of this material is different

385
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,700
Although the same

386
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
but you will measure the difference

387
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,600
because this

388
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
So use a resistivity

389
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,400
Using resistivity is not equal to

390
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,600
It is only a negative film as a material

391
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,000
so everything

392
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
if you check now

393
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
just check everything

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,600
arch gold copper silver

395
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,200
have a certain resistivity at room temperature

396
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
Then this is a table

397
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,100
everyone this is

398
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,400
If Ohm's Law

399
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
Then this is electricity

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
it's easy

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
just like the flow of water

402
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Water press

403
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
then you have flow

404
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And then you just viscosity it

405
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is called a resistor here

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Then if you are in an ideal body

407
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I take this at this time

408
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A Nature Physics cover that came out to draw the cover

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
draw this beautifully

410
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
these atoms

411
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Different sizes represent different atoms

412
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Ranked seventy-seven

413
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is our hypothetical ideal body

414
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Every atom is in its rightful place

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
A very regular structure arranged neatly

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
where are you high

417
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Plus it's a superconductor

418
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's the same as the blue back

419
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is Wu Maokun Su Jingwu

420
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
this was done

421
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is the Nano watch award

422
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No they're the one Bandle Mueller found

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is what you see neatly arranged

424
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
if you imagine this is this

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
These atoms are

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
it lined up the whole

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The body is very structured

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Then under such words

429
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
of course you can ask

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
Where do I get the resistors?

431
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
In fact, there is no resistance

432
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,760
If your resistor

433
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,920
If it is very powerful

434
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,080
It's all the same

435
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,160
You won't have resistors anymore

436
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,760
So everyone thought of it before

437
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,520
you may not have a resistor

438
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,560
the so-called resistance

439
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,040
The possible reason everyone thinks

440
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,440
that must be out of alignment

441
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,360
One of the reasons is right

442
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,040
if you these

443
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,560
position of some atoms

444
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,240
not your usual

445
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,080
If this position is placed

446
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,520
The position of the pendulum

447
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,840
it went sideways a bit

448
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,440
a little to the right

449
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,960
There is an extra charge in the hole

450
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,720
atom

451
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
Then when your electrons are running

452
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
will collide

453
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,280
Just like everyone sitting here

454
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,120
sit well

455
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,040
then if you have to go through

456
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,200
If there is no middle

457
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,480
Everyone sit well

458
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,520
Then if there are a few people crooked

459
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,800
Then it will be difficult for you to leave

460
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
you will hit

461
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,520
Then when you hit this electron

462
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,080
you will have resistance

463
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,560
This is where the main resistance comes from

464
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,520
It is because of the flash of impurities

465
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,960
Of course, a piece as big as the body

466
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,960
The body is one centimeter in length, width and height

467
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,900
But if it is not perfect, you will have this problem

468
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,100
This is one of the main sources of resistance.

469
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,640
This is what everyone probably knew before

470
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,860
I'm just talking about the previous resistance problem that reminds everyone

471
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,940
Every time this resistor hits

472
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,240
In fact, it will make this atom move

473
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,700
so energy is lost

474
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,940
This is why there is energy when there is resistance

475
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,440
That's what we have in this resistor problem

476
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,280
Why is there heat when there is resistance?

477
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,680
all computers are

478
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,840
Most of the heat in all computers is due to the resistance born

479
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
That is, what we are moistening are all resistances.

480
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,480
So most of the heat comes out of the resistor

481
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,680
all electronic everything

482
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,240
this is one of the factors

483
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,980
Of course there is another factor

484
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,280
It's that you arrange these atoms neatly

485
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,740
They were also disturbed to break up and sat there huddled

486
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,080
It's not like everyone here is doing a good job listening

487
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
But after a while you probably don't want to move

488
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,800
Move your hands, move your feet, move your head

489
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,600
It also moves on this principle

490
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,200
And the reason it moves is of course related to quantum mechanics

491
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,400
A characteristic of quantum mechanics is that

492
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,000
The more motionless you are, the higher your energy will be

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,400
The more you have to expand your range of motion

494
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,500
In fact, the lower the energy

495
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,800
This is the Uncertainty Principle of Quantum Mechanics

496
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
you may have heard it before

497
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,200
this is related to this

498
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,200
So atoms even at absolute zero temperature

499
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,800
Atoms can still move, it is impossible to stay still

500
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,000
this thing is troublesome

501
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,800
When it moves, you, the electron, are running

502
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,700
will bump into

503
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Because of it, you were good at first, and everyone took a pat to do it well.

504
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,700
You now hit like this atom passing by

505
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,800
atoms hit

506
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,400
Especially if you're going from one end to the other

507
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,600
The distance on the other end is

508
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Usually we say that less than one is unavoidable

509
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,820
This distance is less than one nanometer

510
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:09,000
But you have to go from one end of the electron to the other end by walking 10 to the 7th power of Naimi

511
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It is 7 orders of magnitude of rice

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's 10 million times

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Then of course you have a very high chance of colliding.

514
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
bump bump bump bump bump

515
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The current becomes very small

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Not many pass

517
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's a lot of heat

518
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So this is also a

519
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I just said half of what I just said about semiconductors.

520
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You see it looks like metal when it's hot

521
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Acts like an insulator at low temperatures

522
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
this is semiconductor

523
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's just that it only works for half a day.

524
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
then stop

525
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The metal is completely different.

526
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But the colder it is, the lower its resistance

527
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This has a feature

528
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
but when it won't go to zero

529
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
There is a problem with this

530
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The performance of this is to say

531
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It is a characteristic of metal

532
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The characteristics of that semiconductor

533
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If it is an insulator, it will run up from the beginning

534
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,840
It just looks like there's no resistance and it's very high

535
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,340
That's another reason

536
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,740
the atom itself

537
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,240
That is, you have grown a very good body

538
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,040
That atom is not very safe

539
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,440
Then this will also cause resistance

540
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,340
There is another one, of course

541
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,440
The problem with electrons is that they all carry a charge

542
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,600
same charge

543
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,160
We all know that like charges repel each other.

544
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,200
cool wheel force

545
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,900
Everyone remembers this

546
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,140
Then of course the cool wheel force can cause problems too.

547
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,100
Then your electron will hit you as soon as you move.

548
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,300
This cool wheel force affects the battery next door

549
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,300
next to the battery

550
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,700
all will be affected

551
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,200
if you go astray

552
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,200
you should have gone like this

553
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,180
Everyone should go like this

554
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,180
when the current flows

555
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,240
we all want to go together

556
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,000
you come across this EY

557
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,140
you will hit other

558
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,040
hit hit hit hit

559
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,340
hit a lot of electrons

560
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,340
Then the whole scattering is very troublesome

561
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,800
becomes a very fast loss of energy

562
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,300
Then the current becomes smaller

563
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,940
It hit a lot of water pipes

564
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,100
something other than water flowing past

565
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
will hit

566
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,560
your miscosy gets bigger

567
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,560
the same principle

568
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,760
So the main thing I'm talking about here is these factors.

569
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
This problem is what I just said about resistors.

570
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,640
just said it was mentioned

571
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,840
Is this resistor really 0?

572
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
10 negative quad ohms

573
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,560
You say you look small when measured

574
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,680
If you change what I just said today

575
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,800
Change your same material to increase the section area

576
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,160
Isn't the resistance half

577
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,000
then you're smaller again

578
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,520
Then if you make this material longer

579
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,880
double the resistance

580
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,360
right

581
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,680
That means you are 0 or not 0

582
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,400
If it is 0, how can I width and length

583
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
it should all be 0

584
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,880
So are you really 0?

585
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
Or your equipment is not very good

586
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,640
Of course in 1911 I don't think the instruments are very good

587
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,440
we all know

588
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,280
This is far from now

589
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,200
Is the small 0 of water really 0?

590
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,440
So why not 0.00001?

591
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,320
plus a 0

592
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
10-6 is 0

593
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that's not 0

594
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So this topic is kind of interesting

595
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
is what is called 0

596
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Certainly a very special concept

597
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
i remember where i read

598
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
0 Chinese people did not have 0 at the beginning

599
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It seems that there is no 0 in Chinese numbers.

600
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
When it hits 0, it jumps over

601
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
We have negative certificates but no 0

602
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
But it seems that a mathematician in India invented

603
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
it's a bold move

604
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
This proxy is really 0

605
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the question of course

606
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
someone will bring it up soon

607
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
you see this you say 0

608
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So he didn't dare to say 0 o'clock

609
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
His name is supercanda

610
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
he got a good name

611
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
called super

612
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Not small things call it super

613
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Probably a very good idea

614
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
this is a good thing

615
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
so he called super

616
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is English, this word is very useful

617
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Of course, there will be a challenge immediately

618
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,800
Better Instruments More Accurate Measurements

619
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,600
can i get this

620
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
How to do it?

621
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,800
then they say

622
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
if we just said

623
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
voltage equals current times resistance

624
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,200
right? everyone has learned this

625
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
If you say this thing is equal to 0

626
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,800
If there is a thing

627
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,000
The right side here is equal to 0

628
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,400
Of course, the left side must be equal to 0

629
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,200
That means I didn't add the battery

630
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
I can also have current

631
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,800
How is that?

632
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,200
Let's say you start by adding a little bit of voltage

633
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Let the current start to run and then exceed

634
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Then you take the battery away

635
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,800
most of the material

636
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,400
If you do this the battery will die immediately

637
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,000
you can measure

638
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,600
Everyone knows that there will be no current

639
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
If you take the usual conductor

640
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,600
you do this

641
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
the current will be back soon

642
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
Then they did this experiment

643
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,400
take it away

644
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,000
just let the current run

645
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,400
As soon as it runs it takes the battery away

646
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
then watch

647
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,800
When will this current disappear

648
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,600
This is a good TES

649
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,400
If you have resistance

650
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
it's gone

651
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Then they went for more than a year

652
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,400
This is really an experiment

653
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,600
more than a year

654
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
This current is almost

655
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Of course they can't wait any longer

656
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It is also difficult to write paper

657
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Even a little bit is fine

658
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
almost you are small

659
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It means there is little resistance

660
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The current estimate is 10-2

661
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Is its square ohm meter

662
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
is resistivity

663
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Of course this is the best instrument

664
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
may be this orum

665
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
In fact the result

666
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
then very important

667
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
it is not 0.0001

668
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It is likely to be exactly 0

669
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
this is interesting

670
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
because most things

671
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We learn things like

672
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
you have many decimal points

673
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
you can take 10-6

674
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What - 100 times

675
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Just -100 is not 0

676
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
How do you say it is exactly 0

677
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
this is an interesting question

678
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
we have words for each of you

679
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's easy to say 0

680
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If we are 1 2 3

681
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
we say one person two people

682
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,400
You can say that the 0 people are no one in the room

683
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,900
Of course then I thought there was a problem

684
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,200
Someone comes in with one foot, do you want to count it as 0.3 people

685
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,600
it's a bit of a hassle

686
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,200
But if you use him to count, you will say 1, 2, 3

687
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,400
-1-2, 0 is very simple

688
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,700
But what if you want to count by 10, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001?

689
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,600
This reminds me of the Sanju Qing'an in Taiwan a while ago

690
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,800
If you want to subtract 0, it will be troublesome. What is 0 minus?

691
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,800
This obviously depends a lot on what instrument you're using.

692
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,600
It's just that the equipment I just mentioned is a bit rotten.

693
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,400
You subtract everything from 0, because you can't measure anything

694
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,200
But if you use a good instrument, nothing is 0 minus

695
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,000
because there is something to see

696
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,100
So this thing is here, and this is the same

697
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,100
This question is of course a long time quarrel, isn't it exactly 0?

698
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,900
But what I'm talking about here is that this is the real 0

699
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,100
exactly 0, mathematically you can say it is precisely

700
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,000
not that almost

701
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,200
or not there is or there is not

702
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,700
It only has one or no resistance or no resistance

703
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,200
The one without resistance is exactly no resistance

704
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,000
So this state is immediately small from this perspective.

705
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,300
Because in physics we study classical physics

706
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,600
What variables and phenomena are continuous

707
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,200
0.001 is fine, you look at 0.001

708
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Keep going, you measure more and more

709
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,600
decimal point but never exactly

710
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,000
but in quantum mechanics

711
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
everything is discrete

712
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,000
So when you see this you know

713
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,400
This state is beyond our classical understanding

714
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,400
state, the electron enters a new state

715
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,400
The electron suddenly changed

716
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,000
It becomes a product of a quantum

717
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
it must be bright small

718
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Otherwise it wouldn't be exacting

719
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
only bright

720
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
we are 1 2 3 0

721
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Now of course there are other examples

722
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
some other its conductance

723
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
are called bright numbers

724
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
This is all because of the small size of the light

725
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It is not an ordinary material

726
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
you can see it

727
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
this is the first point

728
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
it is bright small

729
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
At first this guide

730
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
did not understand this

731
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
so didn't give that onus

732
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Because of discovery manipulation

733
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
This discovery is of course an extraordinary thing

734
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
for finding a new quantum

735
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
of course at that time

736
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
We've only just begun with the mechanics of the light

737
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
don't understand at all

738
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't even dare to say now

739
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Our understanding of the mechanics of light

740
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
just we know how to use it

741
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
wait a minute we'll talk

742
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But it can have a definite

743
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We know that it must be discrete

744
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
discontinuity

745
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
This is a characteristic of the leon phenomenon

746
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
give it many other features

747
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Like the uncertainty principle just mentioned, etc.

748
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
well-known phenomenon

749
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
that this is a feature

750
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
is discrete

751
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
it is not a continuum

752
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Then everyone knows this very clearly, right?

753
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
If you look at the periodic table

754
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Did you learn the periodic table

755
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
It is very hard to memorize this periodic table

756
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
i can never get it back

757
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
But if the periodic table is here

758
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You look carefully at every periodic table

759
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
How does it define its atomic number

760
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It is like this is this Sodium

761
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Then its electron is an orbital

762
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's called ES2,2S2P6

763
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Then you see it is represented by numbers

764
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
very discreet

765
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Discrete

766
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
it is not a continuous

767
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Nothing 0.99sqa

768
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
it has a special track for everything

769
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
its orbit is discrete

770
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Then all these things are according to this card

771
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Of course, the real inside is a little richer than this.

772
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But it is a discrete

773
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It's very simple, it's an electron

774
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
the one we just talked about

775
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The electrons in the conductor are 10 in the 23-foot room

776
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
There are 10 to 23 electrons in a conductor of one centimeter or three centimeters

777
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But it is also discrete

778
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That is of course a very miraculous thing

779
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
This is just an example, the quantum mechanics that everyone is familiar with must be discrete

780
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
This theory was solved in 1957

781
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
They held it in 1973 and don't talk about it

782
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It is very surprising that this theory was proposed in 1957

783
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
because they solved the problem

784
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Of course, many people do not get this question completely right.

785
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
they are totally right

786
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
They not only explain the mechanism of superconductivity

787
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Also explains the quantum state of superconductivity

788
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
The whole topic starts from using quantum physics to solve this problem

789
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
that can fully explain

790
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Of course it's amazing

791
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
amazing job

792
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
able to explain the problem

793
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Of course there are a lot of new ideas coming from here

794
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
They don't even know they've done it themselves.

795
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Some are amazing new ideas

796
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This was of course understood later

797
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Let me explain their main theories a little bit today

798
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Why does this mechanism exceed

799
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Electronics, we know that besides electric nuclear, there are optional

800
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Everyone says that electrons revolve around themselves

801
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In fact, of course, with a unique concept

802
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Actually it has one thing

803
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
like optional

804
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
it can have up or down

805
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
By or by or whatever you say

806
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Anyway, there are two states

807
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
it sometimes goes up and sometimes it goes down

808
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
This thing is powerful

809
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So it can work in strength

810
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Therefore, in addition to the energy expansion effect between electrons and electrons

811
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
In addition to this, it also has the effect of strength

812
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,800
There are also continuous words with atoms and ions

813
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,000
it will all work

814
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,600
Well here are some new

815
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,700
The characteristic of this theory is that

816
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,200
They have a guy named Cooper

817
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
Then CooperPay is pairing

818
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,500
Electronic pairing is called CooperPay

819
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,900
is its most important job

820
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,600
It states that electrons can form a pair

821
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,500
Especially these two electrons

822
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,100
Different choices can form a pair

823
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,600
This is a simple Picture that says

824
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,700
they will form a pair

825
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,700
then of course you are weird

826
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,600
There is Kuren force in it

827
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,400
how does it come to form a pair

828
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,900
what makes it pair

829
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,400
because it clearly should exclude

830
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,100
then how does it pair

831
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,900
what about this pairing

832
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,500
that question of course

833
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,400
They came up with a mechanism

834
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,700
of course proven

835
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't be speaking outside

836
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,800
Experiments Many experiments have shown

837
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,020
The mechanism is actually quite simple

838
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,980
From that point of view

839
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,120
because we know

840
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,720
In addition to the electrons in the meridian

841
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,980
You still have ions, right?

842
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,440
shock drive

843
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,020
because its electrons run away

844
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,380
run around

845
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,020
have one or two electrons

846
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,460
don't follow this atom box

847
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,160
it ran out by itself and wandered around

848
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,620
Its atomic box is of course the shock driver

849
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,060
electron is attached

850
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,540
you atomic box

851
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,300
will again

852
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,740
This ion will vibrate

853
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,180
this is what we just said

854
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,480
oscillate to oscillate

855
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,340
So if you say you have a

856
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,780
Electrons go here first

857
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,340
Atom boxes next to these two

858
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,280
Because it's shocking

859
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,040
see additional

860
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,580
Of course they squeeze in

861
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,380
like

862
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,080
if we have this here

863
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,020
different gender

864
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,640
It's all about a woman

865
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,120
sit here

866
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,880
come closer

867
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,580
the role of this

868
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,280
created a little attraction

869
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,180
this attraction

870
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,840
Then when the two atomic boxes are close together

871
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,040
just a little bit more shocking

872
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,920
because it appends

873
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
If those two are aligned

874
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,840
These two add up to one more regular price

875
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,160
The other electron also wants to join in the fun

876
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,240
between such mutual influences

877
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,560
on this principle

878
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,240
From another point of view, it is equal to these atomic boxes

879
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,360
dug a hole

880
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,440
Those two electrons jumped in

881
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,840
It's because of this atomic hole

882
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,360
So you electronic background

883
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,400
it ran in one by two

884
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,760
Just take this potential

885
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,640
This negative failed to increase

886
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,360
Negative fails to add another electron

887
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,240
just saw again

888
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,000
have jumped in

889
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,880
So these two are starting to become each other

890
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,480
attracting

891
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,640
This is of course a very simple diagram.

892
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,040
This situation means that the child

893
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,160
We call this child

894
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,440
ion vibration

895
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
we call birth

896
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,680
on sound transmission

897
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,840
your metal

898
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,480
If you hit it, there will be a sound transmission

899
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
That sound is transmitted by this vibration

900
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,560
The vibration of this atom

901
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,400
Then this vibration is giving birth

902
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,120
Then this child is acting

903
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,480
Eliminate a Glu combination

904
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,840
just out of medicine

905
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,800
it comes here

906
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
grab these two

907
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,800
the two of them can be exchanged

908
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,000
information can work

909
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
If this is strong enough to dig the composition

910
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's better if their repulsion isn't that strong.

911
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,800
Of course, this fitting picture is drawn very small

912
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
real time

913
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,600
The distance between these two pads can be quite far

914
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,400
If we each count as a round

915
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,600
If it fits

916
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
if you sit here

917
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,600
These two cushions can be partitioned behind the wall

918
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,400
this pair of electrons

919
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,400
So the mat pairs in question are not necessarily the closest neighbors

920
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,200
it can pad for a long distance

921
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,600
This can also cause this reaction

922
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Dara has a few special ones in it

923
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:54,400
What it says is that the vibration of the rope is very important

924
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
it will produce

925
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
if it doesn't work with the rope

926
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
I said if these things can't move

927
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,460
fix it there then it's gone

928
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,460
that doesn't need a guide

929
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,640
Because we can have perfect love

930
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,700
The ideal classic also has no resistance

931
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,960
But that one has no resistance

932
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,960
It's a completely different mechanism than this

933
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,660
this is there

934
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,700
But it creates another situation

935
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,660
no resistance

936
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,900
It goes from having a resistor to one without a resistor

937
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,040
The most important thing is that it will form a CouplePet

938
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,300
That's what CouplePet has

939
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,540
So why is there no resistance?

940
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:30,000
This is what I found for a painting

941
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,900
the russian painter

942
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,700
Drawings by Pervoninsky

943
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,540
I think this is my favorite way to express

944
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,700
The end electrons in the CouplePet pair

945
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,900
what to do in there

946
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
Like so many people dancing Wars

947
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,540
waltz

948
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,400
in that hall

949
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,700
you see so many people jumping

950
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,840
A man and a woman are making noise

951
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,700
Then you can exchange pottener with each other

952
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,060
Exchange your Pay

953
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,360
can be exchanged

954
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
How does he turn?

955
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,000
here again

956
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,560
There are flowers, chairs, tables, and pillars

957
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,600
no problem

958
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,720
it keeps turning around

959
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
The whole weave jumps

960
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
so you can imagine

961
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,520
Suppose there is such a beautiful

962
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,240
so many teams jumping over there

963
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,680
how to dance

964
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
dancing to the music

965
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,000
don't imagine each other

966
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,920
won't run into any obstacles

967
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,760
What kind of pillars are the tables and chairs?

968
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,960
just can go around

969
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,080
no matter what

970
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,320
and then exchange each other

971
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,560
of these two

972
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,720
can't express it all

973
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,200
Because the two of them are still close

974
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,040
but you can imagine

975
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,760
some dancing

976
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,480
We could have separated when we were kids

977
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,360
two jump like this

978
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,200
then go over

979
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,920
jump like this

980
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,000
then if you imagine

981
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
In the current situation

982
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,360
That's what all the electrons are doing

983
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,200
The electrons are divided one by one

984
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,840
Well done

985
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,800
That is the last election

986
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,520
Next time choose one to one red electron

987
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,720
Every electron can see

988
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,440
it's one come one red

989
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,080
just jump each other once

990
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,920
This is probably the most beautiful dancing episode

991
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,000
no matter how you dance

992
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,280
They are all very synchronized

993
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,080
then this is real

994
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
it's a huge amount

995
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Why talk about macro

996
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Because it's not about an electron

997
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
two electrons

998
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
real

999
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This 23rd power electron

1000
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Tongtong is doing the same thing

1001
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
this is incredible

1002
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This miracle of nature is

1003
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
far more than we think

1004
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
how do you get all the electrons

1005
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
They all do this synchronous operation

1006
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
and won't install that episode

1007
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
so no electrons

1008
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
there are these pillars

1009
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
What table and chairs are there in the middle?

1010
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
also won't pretend

1011
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's all over

1012
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
These can also jump farther

1013
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
that's what i'm talking about here

1014
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
one there

1015
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
how much are you right

1016
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
dance here

1017
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So there are many pairs in between

1018
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But I can still pair with that

1019
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
you paired with that

1020
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
jumping

1021
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But this is the closest I found

1022
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I can't find a better icon

1023
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
if you go and close your eyes

1024
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
think about this scenario

1025
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Just thought this is so beautiful

1026
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,200
This real physics is indeed very beautiful

1027
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
It's so hard to imagine

1028
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
then they are not human

1029
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,000
How can they be so harmonious

1030
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
such

1031
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
this is what i said

1032
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
This coordination and harmony synchronize

1033
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
this word is hard to come by

1034
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
but they do it all

1035
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So that means that every electron

1036
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
is actually doing the same thing for every electron

1037
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
Of course, we cannot tell the difference between electrons and electrons.

1038
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
people we can see

1039
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
This man has a beard and no beard

1040
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
that just means

1041
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Of course you can't tell the difference

1042
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
This is the electronics rack

1043
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
electronic handle

1044
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
of course not

1045
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Then all the electrons are like

1046
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Then of course all electrons do the same thing

1047
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
This is the real view. It's too good.

1048
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Then this can also be exchanged partners

1049
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Of course I won't say more now

1050
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
It also goes in the opposite direction

1051
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
I just didn't say

1052
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
I can't fix this picture

1053
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
you go ahead

1054
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,800
This is your cooperation

1055
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,300
go here mate, go here

1056
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,000
if you go to the right, it goes to the left

1057
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,200
If you go backwards, it will go backwards

1058
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,400
walk in the opposite direction, all steps

1059
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,000
So it's like dancing

1060
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,600
Because this pace is to match

1061
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,200
The console of the same nature doesn't like it

1062
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,600
Of course, because of this same article, it doesn't like it

1063
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,000
You will be paired to guess good, subject to different

1064
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,300
Because as you can imagine, it dances so harmoniously

1065
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,000
If someone suddenly sees

1066
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
That's terrible, many people next to me will follow suit

1067
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,600
a lot is going to go wrong

1068
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,000
If someone goes to a dance buddy one hits the wall

1069
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,200
The other one will be miserable

1070
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Someone next to me will hit the wall

1071
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,600
Creates a lot of matching at once , guess good

1072
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,000
This is not a good thing, it will be lost

1073
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Just now I saw that one of them dug a trap

1074
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,300
Now if you want to guess Shan, there will be no more

1075
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,200
there is no way

1076
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,000
The other one is, if you say

1077
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,400
The pair of blue and red in the middle is jumping

1078
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
The blue ones are much more than the red ones, so how do you match them?

1079
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
one question

1080
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Difficult to match even if the numbers are different

1081
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
how to become a guide

1082
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So both of these will cause manipulation

1083
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
unstable attitude

1084
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Then this is of course the CooperPair

1085
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
broke it apart

1086
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That's because it's too much

1087
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
CooperPair has an up and a down

1088
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
There are a lot more up than down.

1089
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
no right

1090
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
dancing alone

1091
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Of course it is not possible

1092
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
performance evenly

1093
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
In fact, this thing is an external magnetic field

1094
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
will cause the phenomenon

1095
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Because the electron I just mentioned has

1096
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
self-taught backspin

1097
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
it is magnetic

1098
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So the magnetic field will affect it

1099
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
The influence of the magnetic field will cause these things

1100
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
then this is what we are now

1101
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Let's do some experiments for you

1102
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
This is the magnetic field you see

1103
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Why is there a magnetic field

1104
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
In fact, it has a lot to do with this

1105
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Because this is why it prefers Chen Taitai

1106
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,640
If a magnetic field is forced to be applied, what kind of phenomenon will it produce?

1107
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,500
Just because it doesn't like this, so it does weird things

1108
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:14,940
shall we do this demonstration

1109
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,440
Of course this will burn, 77 degrees is very cold

1110
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,560
If you take a small piece of metal, it'll all sit in there, and it'll become brittle

1111
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,520
So this is pretty awesome

1112
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,720
so be sure to wear gloves

1113
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:43,520
The experiment it does is to put a magnet on this high-temperature conductor

1114
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,520
Hang it up, hang it up from that cup, hang it up

1115
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,320
Hanging fish is a fun place, there is no line for hanging fish

1116
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:57,720
That is, Jiang Taigong does not use a line to hang fish, and he also does not use a line to hang fish

1117
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,120
it has no wires but it won't soak

1118
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,760
It can be sent to the high temperature conductor itself

1119
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,400
there is no rope to pull it up

1120
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,800
it can pull the material out of it

1121
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,400
from inside this cup of it

1122
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,200
can go pull it out

1123
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,800
so it has a magnet on it

1124
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,200
so it's now stuck to its

1125
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,160
not your family

1126
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,400
stick to this

1127
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,800
take it take it

1128
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200
then if you look carefully

1129
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,400
it should only be five to ten seconds

1130
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
yes you only have five to ten seconds

1131
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,200
The reason for my show here is that the light consumption can be rushed through.

1132
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
there is nothing in it

1133
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,000
it's grungy

1134
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,700
Empty, it's just not long enough

1135
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,860
It's about to pull, it's not enough, it's space

1136
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,060
But you can see that it's not very stable when you pull it up.

1137
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,200
wait a minute i'll talk about it this

1138
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,400
Why is it not too stable

1139
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,300
because when it is held

1140
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,700
It was put on after the tide island has been changed.

1141
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,900
You can see that the two are actually separated

1142
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,200
it didn't touch

1143
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,200
This itself if not frozen

1144
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,500
it can't be picked up

1145
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,800
So this can levitate it

1146
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This is another kind, the magnetic point is below

1147
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,600
you can tell it's floating

1148
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,200
and quite stable

1149
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,200
The one just now was not so stable

1150
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
this is very stable

1151
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,500
wait there is a reason

1152
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,000
Why is it that one or two are a bit different

1153
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It's a magnet that's already on it

1154
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,500
under this track

1155
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,500
So it can float

1156
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
This is floating

1157
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:23,000
This can last a long time

1158
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
This time it's completely stopped

1159
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I keep looking

1160
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
this is so enjoyable

1161
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Of course it's fun to be inside the gate

1162
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Not this one

1163
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
that was done

1164
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Somebody make a person this big stand on it and float

1165
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
this

1166
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
good

1167
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Thanks

1168
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
thank you both

1169
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
good

1170
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
explained

1171
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
The place where this explanation was just now

1172
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
it's this thing

1173
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,420
The characteristic is the magnetic field of our home

1174
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,660
Of course, the magnetic fields of the two homes are actually different.

1175
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,560
It can be said that this is

1176
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,500
Originally, the magnetic field acts on this

1177
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,120
Before becoming superconducting

1178
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,000
The magnetic field is already acting on the material

1179
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,120
and then you cool it down

1180
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,000
This one originally had no magnetic field.

1181
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,120
That you cool it first and then add the magnetic field

1182
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,120
These two are actually not the same

1183
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,640
It can be seen that this is not stable

1184
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,640
It's very stable when you pull it up

1185
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,600
very stable species

1186
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,960
Of course there is a very simple reason for this

1187
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,560
But the most important reason is that these are

1188
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,920
These superconductors don't like this magnetic field too much

1189
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,320
so what does he do

1190
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,000
Of course it's easy

1191
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,360
drain it

1192
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,680
If it's not good and you don't like it, let it out

1193
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,920
is their greatest practice

1194
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,440
Well, of course, the situation of this discharge is like this

1195
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,360
Usually we think of common metals

1196
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,000
We all learned about Faraday

1197
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
cognitive law

1198
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That is, if you take a metal

1199
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
with a magnetic field

1200
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
when you put in

1201
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The magnetic field causes a current in the metal

1202
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Current is usually

1203
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Sensing direction

1204
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Just enough to cancel your magnetic field

1205
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
but ordinary metal

1206
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
not very strong

1207
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
because of what

1208
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
because of current

1209
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
there will be resistance

1210
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
at last there will be no more

1211
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The current is gone

1212
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So other than this is not very strong

1213
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
but in dick too

1214
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
This current will not disappear

1215
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So its current can be very strong

1216
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
can stay for a long time

1217
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
can generate a strong magnetic field

1218
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
The two magnetic fields are of course opposite to each other.

1219
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
This is called shielding current

1220
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
that you now have

1221
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
the experiment just now

1222
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
That is, a magnet is placed under it and above it.

1223
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
when it is placed like this

1224
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
This magnetic field goes from North Pole to South Pole

1225
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
When going through this tutorial material

1226
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
it is squeezed

1227
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Look at this magnetic force line

1228
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It is logical that it should come down like this

1229
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
But it's not it's squeezed out

1230
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,880
How is it squeezed? Because the superconductivity here will generate a current

1231
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,880
Just like ordinary metal, as I just said

1232
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,000
If you add a permanent, it will generate current

1233
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,880
The superconducting current will not disappear because it has no resistance

1234
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,880
So it keeps flowing, and it produces the exact opposite

1235
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,720
It also generates a North Pole here

1236
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,120
The two north poles face each other, everyone will move if they know it

1237
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,240
Yes, take two battery holders

1238
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,240
Sometimes it's similar, sometimes it's different

1239
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,520
Your North Pole is like the North Pole, and the North Pole is like the South Pole

1240
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,440
Then it happens to be North Pole to North Pole

1241
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,600
This is the famous symbol

1242
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,480
That is to say, this word has been known for a long time

1243
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,680
It doesn't have to be superconducting

1244
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,280
But with superconductivity, this force becomes much larger

1245
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,160
This is what I copied from the picture in their Shuangyuehai

1246
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,280
I don't know how to draw this

1247
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,160
They drew it very well, the magnetic lines look like this

1248
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,160
Look at this, bending like this actually creates force

1249
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,640
Because the lines of force don't like to bend like this

1250
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,560
If you bend it like this, it will only compress tightly.

1251
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,240
So you can't fall, you can't hold down even with gravity

1252
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Magnetic lines lift you up

1253
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,960
At that time, it was also said that there was an arctic market here.

1254
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,960
so lift him up

1255
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,120
that this is amazing

1256
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,080
because why doesn't he like

1257
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:07,960
that's what i just said

1258
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,960
because you're going to ruin his match

1259
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,360
You have to make him not able to dance there harmoniously

1260
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,760
make him unhappy

1261
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,520
what will he do

1262
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,480
he puts you out

1263
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,920
don't let you eat sugar

1264
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,440
This is of course an interesting thing

1265
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,960
This is what nature does automatically

1266
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,120
get you out

1267
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,760
That way, the energy is relatively low.

1268
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,400
This is just floating

1269
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,320
But this buoy is only repulsive

1270
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,000
This brain is not very stable

1271
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,240
So just now it can be seen

1272
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,440
then he is not very stable

1273
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,280
In fact, some of this stuff will slowly seep in.

1274
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,480
seeps into its edge

1275
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,240
Then this just said that MineSyn

1276
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,000
That's what happened just now

1277
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,640
In fact, there is another way

1278
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,080
If your magnetic field strength is too high

1279
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,320
it has another way

1280
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,200
it can't be discharged

1281
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,000
because you are too strong

1282
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
What should he do then?

1283
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
well , he confines you to a small space

1284
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Think about how clever this nature is

1285
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Then I can't deal with you, you are too strong

1286
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
What am I doing? I keep all your magnetic fields small

1287
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Just like the pillars, the same pillars you just jumped on

1288
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
then i'll be fine i'm old

1289
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
nothing to do with me

1290
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
what he can do

1291
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Someone figured this out

1292
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Then this thing is, let's talk about it later and get the road sign to talk about it

1293
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Well, this thing is very interesting. It's called a mixing station.

1294
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
That is, some lines of magnetic force are discharged to the outside, and some are mixed in.

1295
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
The one in that row, this one is called

1296
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Just now we called the Myzen effect

1297
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's weird that this guy didn't get the road sign

1298
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
This, this has got the road sign to tell

1299
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Arranged in a small space, this is called a mixing table

1300
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Well, this is of course very important

1301
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Then the mixing station mentioned just now is actually even more mysterious if you really look at it carefully.

1302
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,380
That is, you still had this shielding current just now.

1303
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,280
I just said that you have shielding current when you hold the field.

1304
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,040
This pool line will go in

1305
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,320
Then we discovered the pool line

1306
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,160
It's actually a pool

1307
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,760
Each pool line has a certain pool moment

1308
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,640
not casual

1309
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,600
we usually talk about pool

1310
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:30,400
Let's talk about 0.1 high humidity or Tesla

1311
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,760
0.001 is the speed per hour

1312
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,560
continuous

1313
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,240
but here to tell you it's not

1314
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,840
In this quantum state

1315
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,840
This thing itself is a quantum number

1316
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:49,040
Each of these original rights represents a certain basic holding

1317
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,600
Everyone is well arranged

1318
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,800
Here it's actually neatly drawn

1319
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,800
Each has six neighboring triangular lattices next to it

1320
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,880
This is Abbey Kossoff narrating

1321
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,400
It is what I talked about in 2003 with the Noble Watch

1322
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,300
Just because I solved it

1323
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,700
mainly a job

1324
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,600
Let him speak with a watch

1325
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,800
Is to lift this Ubricos of lattice

1326
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,200
This proof is of course too much time to prove now

1327
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:16,800
this is right

1328
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,200
you can go straight to it

1329
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,700
You sprinkle some iron powder on it

1330
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,600
You can look directly at this magnetic flux

1331
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,200
how

1332
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,600
Of course each one has a vortice

1333
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,200
there is no superconducting team in it don't like to be in it

1334
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,200
superconducting team is right outside it

1335
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,800
All the superconducting teams are out of it

1336
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,000
make a fuss

1337
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's like you've got lots of assistants and you're dancing

1338
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
You are making trouble with the assistant

1339
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,800
then don't run inside

1340
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,800
That's what they do electronically

1341
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,000
Then this CobraPack is amazing

1342
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
he would do it himself

1343
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,800
and not one or two

1344
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,000
That's what everyone does

1345
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,800
That's what I just said

1346
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
Why is it more stable?

1347
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,000
In fact, the magnetic flux is in this

1348
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,360
will also lock

1349
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,520
it's somewhere

1350
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:03,760
For example, some impurities

1351
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,720
it likes to be in the impurities

1352
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,240
We just said that impurities are not very good, right?

1353
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,160
When there is this magnetism

1354
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,680
This magnetic flux will be hired on the impurity

1355
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,480
very strong

1356
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,160
So just say that

1357
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,800
Just now this experiment here

1358
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,000
this small

1359
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,160
This experiment with this little train

1360
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,920
It's on top of this

1361
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,720
because it is in the magnetic field

1362
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,000
The magnet is already inside

1363
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,200
you cool it down

1364
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,080
All the magnetic flux goes inside.

1365
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,280
just stay in there

1366
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,720
so locked

1367
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,280
equal to lock

1368
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,400
when you lift it up now

1369
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,160
This magnetic flux has no place to run

1370
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,920
Everything inside is equivalent to being locked.

1371
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,680
So it's like an invisible rope

1372
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,680
the rope you can't see

1373
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,400
In fact, this material can be smashed

1374
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,000
very stable

1375
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,640
So it runs very stable

1376
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,280
it can't move

1377
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,360
because so much

1378
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,280
stay still

1379
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,040
it can't move

1380
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,680
The one just now is because you didn't add it at the beginning

1381
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,960
no magnet here

1382
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,400
You later surpassed to have

1383
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,320
you want to add

1384
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,120
In fact it is added next to

1385
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,160
very weak

1386
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:56,560
beside

1387
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,400
so it's not very stable

1388
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,040
So I can't live if I smashed it like that just now

1389
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
there is a difference between the two

1390
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,800
If it is placed in a magnetic field first and then cooled

1391
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,400
The two results are not the same

1392
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,600
This result is to tell you

1393
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,000
This is a company with a very stable employment

1394
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,400
so what can this be used for

1395
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,400
can be used as an application

1396
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,200
Now we understand this thing

1397
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,600
we also know why

1398
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,600
Because the Cooper team wants everyone to be harmonious

1399
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,600
if you mess up

1400
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,200
some of the others it's not good

1401
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,000
But it has a way to solve this problem

1402
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,200
it can solve this problem

1403
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,600
Make a Perfect Solution

1404
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,800
All of this I just talked about is consciousness

1405
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,000
Of course quantum mechanics can help you figure it out

1406
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,600
Everything I said can be calculated exactly

1407
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:49,000
This is an incredible result of the BCS theory

1408
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,400
It is not possible to do this quantitatively

1409
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,000
alright

1410
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,200
But there is another not-so-good place in BCS theory

1411
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,800
Its temperature probably won't exceed 40 degrees

1412
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Because someone has done the math on how hard it is for me to increase the temperature

1413
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Because it must have a strong electron ion

1414
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
We just talked about the role of biomass, right?

1415
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Electrons and biomass must have an attractive force to dig a hole for it to enter

1416
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It must be very strong, the stronger it is, the deeper the hole will be dug, and the faster it will fall, right, the better

1417
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:25,000
But you also need a high electron density, that is, a lot of electrons

1418
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
At a certain energy, there must be many electrons in a place close to the low energy

1419
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
But there is no superconductivity without electrons

1420
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So it's impossible for an insulator to superconduct, right?

1421
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
But if you want to put electrons in it, it needs to be superconducting, the more the better

1422
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Then these two must be very large, but when these two are very large, there are actually other problems

1423
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
When this is too strong, like this strong, if this thing is getting stronger

1424
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
This electron can't escape anymore

1425
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Then we just said that it will continue to dance.

1426
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
This is not jumping all the time, jumping from here to that two people have to switch

1427
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
run around, then you may...

1428
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,700
Synchronize Harmony

1429
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:03,000
it jumps now if you don't give it

1430
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,300
Each is fixed in a certain area

1431
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,000
That's an insulator

1432
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,700
You cushion it, even if you add cushions, it can’t jump out

1433
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,200
it can't conduct

1434
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,000
that's over, that's over

1435
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,400
So it has a limitation

1436
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,300
That is to say, if you are too strong

1437
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,300
I can't help it either

1438
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,800
Too weak and I don't have superconductivity

1439
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,000
Then I have to be stronger to resist my rejection point

1440
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,500
I just said that there is a cool person effect

1441
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,300
So there is a lot of balance in it

1442
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,700
have a balance

1443
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,500
that sometimes more

1444
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,700
That's why we want the temperature to be higher, higher and higher

1445
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,700
Then how do you get this out

1446
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,300
So this question was originally

1447
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:43,500
Someone suggested that it is impossible to exceed 40 degrees

1448
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:47,500
This question is of course very frustrating

1449
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Because we just showed 1980

1450
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,100
Of course people who do experiments, people who do physics

1451
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,300
never respond

1452
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,600
What is the limit

1453
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,300
we still have to try

1454
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,000
keep trying

1455
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,600
Then someone tried it

1456
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,600
Then of course do this test

1457
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,400
That's what you see all the way here until 1986

1458
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,720
A total of 74 years later

1459
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,160
These two people won the Nobel Prize

1460
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,720
This was in 1913 and he made it in 1911

1461
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,400
He was made in 1986

1462
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,560
Received the Nobel Prize in 1987

1463
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,880
The Battle of Mirror

1464
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,080
because why

1465
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,960
Because Wu Maokun and Zhu Jinwu helped them dance

1466
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,560
jump from here to here

1467
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,760
this is liquid egg

1468
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,360
So I can now do this experiment and show you guys here

1469
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,040
because they made the material

1470
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,040
it would be hard if i was here

1471
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,520
I'm going to do liquid harm

1472
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,960
Liquid Hazard is very expensive now

1473
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,680
One liter costs five or six hundred Taiwan dollars

1474
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,200
and very troublesome

1475
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,520
evaporated in one go

1476
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,240
very expensive

1477
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
But liquid eggs are cheap

1478
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,200
about as cheap as beer

1479
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,360
So it's very convenient to follow this

1480
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,720
then i can show you guys here

1481
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,560
as soon as they make it

1482
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,240
This is 90 degrees

1483
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,520
Afterwards, everyone followed suit and made similar materials.

1484
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,080
all these are

1485
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,840
The same series has been here

1486
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,960
Of course here we have stopped for many years now

1487
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,440
here comes the problem

1488
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,440
where to find

1489
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,640
Four temperature operation

1490
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,720
But of course this is a very big jump

1491
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,120
jump from here to here

1492
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,480
the whole situation has changed

1493
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,760
because it immediately has a large impact on the application

1494
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,320
This is of course our year

1495
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,000
I have to attend this March Meeting

1496
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,360
Everyone is like the wind

1497
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,240
so old man

1498
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,560
You see, they are all great physicists.

1499
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,080
this is night

1500
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,720
Everyone rush to this special

1501
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,280
Because this is their paper coming out in January

1502
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,640
This meeting will be held in March

1503
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:45,040
This is the largest open-ended physics meeting of the American Physical Society

1504
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,040
There were two to three thousand people at that meeting

1505
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,480
Of course it's tens of thousands now

1506
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,120
There are only two or three thousand people for this mission

1507
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,400
But the waterlines of a few are different

1508
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,440
That hall is full of people

1509
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,280
don't sleep at night

1510
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:56,960
stop eating

1511
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,280
everyone ran to listen

1512
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,040
everyone wants

1513
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,040
everyone has a speech

1514
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,840
few minutes if you have new results

1515
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,200
because they came out

1516
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,600
Everyone hurry back and do it

1517
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,400
Actually I remember that time

1518
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,440
I'm doing theory

1519
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,880
Our colleagues

1520
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,200
We at Virginia Tech

1521
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,200
Our colleagues are also burning this material

1522
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,400
everyone is doing

1523
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,680
Let him measure this and that

1524
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,880
say everyone has to go

1525
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Can't talk for five minutes

1526
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,680
say what we did

1527
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,000
what did we do

1528
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
what did you measure

1529
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,680
There are a lot of people crowded in Allah

1530
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,600
You have to listen to this high tide early

1531
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,280
this is a

1532
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,400
This is Wuastau

1533
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,600
Do you think of this story?

1534
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,080
Wuastau this is the concert

1535
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,280
is an american concert

1536
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,160
This is Wuastau in physics

1537
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,080
This situation is hard to find now

1538
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,120
unless you find now

1539
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,360
Lume Time Media Subbattlete

1540
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,080
You can Battle

1541
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,480
Because it's better than this

1542
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,120
Everyone will be squeezed out

1543
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,160
what about this

1544
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,680
Of course this picture is my favorite

1545
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,720
This is Time Magazine

1546
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,680
Picture from May 11th

1547
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,440
Look, wow, I jumped up excitedly

1548
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,000
This temperature keeps going up

1549
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,480
Say Heating Up

1550
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,760
they are good at writing these

1551
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,000
very nice cover

1552
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,560
This is an important breakthrough for them

1553
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,360
Of course there are many applications

1554
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,360
Let's talk about the various possible applications

1555
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,280
This is Mueller

1556
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,320
Flocks

1557
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,880
The Mueller two

1558
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,320
Take the Noble watch to say happy

1559
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,000
This is what I just said

1560
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,040
ran here suddenly

1561
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,440
in fact a few years ago

1562
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,480
In 2008 there was another group

1563
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,960
temperature high temperature superconducting industry out

1564
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,200
This group has the highest temperature

1565
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,520
now it's 55 degrees

1566
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,960
I'm not just waiting for me to talk

1567
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,880
still higher

1568
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,320
related to this group

1569
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,560
it's iron

1570
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:36,600
This is copper

1571
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,320
here is iron

1572
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,000
The most important element here is copper

1573
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,800
The most important element is iron

1574
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,840
This is also strange

1575
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,480
Because iron is magnetic

1576
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,760
how can this be superconducting

1577
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,840
Here are all materials that are not magnetic

1578
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,760
all here

1579
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,400
you can watch

1580
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,840
Neither are magnetic materials

1581
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,720
At that time, it was not possible to use magnetism for angles.

1582
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,400
it's here

1583
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,800
All of a sudden a complete change

1584
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,320
This is also magnetic

1585
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,640
so the whole

1586
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:59,760
the whole is

1587
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,560
After super-temperature operation, I found a lot of confusion

1588
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,200
Then let me talk about its application first.

1589
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,560
I may be a little slow

1590
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,240
The application I'm going to talk about will be over soon

1591
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,560
Everyone may laugh about the energy crisis

1592
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,160
If you can find energy storage materials

1593
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,700
Renewable Energy and Savings

1594
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,840
Don't turn electricity into heat

1595
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:18,640
it will be much better, right?

1596
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,360
We're all turning electricity into heat now

1597
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,560
But the problem is that you need

1598
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,800
If there is a conductor

1599
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,240
That manipulator can now do a lot of things with magnets

1600
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,040
I just said that because it doesn't

1601
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,280
It does not consume this current

1602
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,200
Therefore, a large current can be passed

1603
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,800
Why couldn't magnets be made before?

1604
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,320
What can't be done with this current wire

1605
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,800
because you're going to be very hot

1606
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,440
So you burn out this one

1607
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,640
So transformer

1608
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,080
almost often the small ones will break

1609
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,320
Transformers often say

1610
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,640
Whoa, the transformer exploded.

1611
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,080
it's too hot and there's trouble

1612
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,000
That wire is thick

1613
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,120
then you start leaking

1614
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,200
trouble

1615
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,040
So if you don't have a resistor

1616
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,040
Of course you can put a lot of current

1617
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,300
you put the car up

1618
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:08,500
You can make a cable to pull electricity from the power plant

1619
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,800
Then you can do this MRI

1620
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,200
This is quantum interference

1621
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,500
In fact, you can also do MRI, what is it called?

1622
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,500
NMR

1623
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,900
It can also be used as a super disturbance green wave machine

1624
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,700
This is an existing product

1625
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,400
Super disturbance green wave machine and so on

1626
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,300
I won't talk much

1627
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,000
The main thing is of course

1628
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,300
like Japan made this stone ax train

1629
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,300
too much to eat

1630
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,600
Its benefit is of course energy saving

1631
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,900
Low noise and high speed can reach 550

1632
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,700
This is twice the speed of our high-speed rail

1633
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,700
can reach this speed

1634
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:52,700
This is the establishment of superconducting Cable in the United States

1635
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,700
for electricity

1636
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,900
They're the latest in Albany, the richest man in New York

1637
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,900
make this cable

1638
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,400
this is very complicated

1639
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,600
high temperature superconductor

1640
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,400
Then pick up this Nitrogen

1641
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,900
It's the liquid nitrogen we just mentioned.

1642
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,700
in it

1643
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,400
Then there are copper wires outside

1644
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm afraid that if something goes wrong

1645
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,700
Immediately this current is so big

1646
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,900
it's a big deal

1647
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,000
so there must be another emergency rescue

1648
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,400
This is also done with the Koreans

1649
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,000
This is the continental superconducting system

1650
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,700
The mainland is also doing

1651
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,400
Started to make this cable system in 2012

1652
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,200
business

1653
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,400
make this superconducting

1654
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,000
OK

1655
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The whole world is progressing

1656
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,700
Japan also bought an American company

1657
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,600
Super Power

1658
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,300
bought it

1659
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,300
and then they

1660
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,900
This is about Power density

1661
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,900
you can get there

1662
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,300
It can pull up to 816 meters

1663
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:54,000
Such a long cable

1664
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,600
572 amps already

1665
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,400
that's big

1666
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,300
Awesome

1667
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,000
has become more and more

1668
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,200
This is strong, this line is of course going up

1669
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,800
Of course, the stronger the better, you can pull electricity for several kilometers

1670
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:12,200
And if there are more than 500 arrangements, of course it is a very good transmission system

1671
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:19,200
So here they have, and there are Korean companies that are also doing this

1672
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,700
So the major countries are doing this

1673
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,500
The other one is to do non-human energy storage

1674
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,800
Inhumans have actually used it to store energy for a long time

1675
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,800
But that object is because you have kinetic energy, because the energy of rotation

1676
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,400
You let that thing if there is no friction a thing keeps turning

1677
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,300
You can treat it as if you turn it faster and faster to transfer energy into it

1678
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,800
When you want to take it out, let it work with a certain

1679
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,100
Let it think slowly, let it transfer energy to another

1680
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,800
As for this non-human being, it is of course better to use the drill now, because there is no friction

1681
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:57,800
So it can do a good job, the first one published by Superpower America

1682
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Storage now saves energy

1683
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
stored energy is a large

1684
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Staying true to energy is important

1685
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So this is a very important technique

1686
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Of course you can do what you just said

1687
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
NMR etc.

1688
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
you need big magnets

1689
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Now of course in the collider of the High Energy Experiment

1690
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
They all use super old magnets.

1691
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
because it is relatively small

1692
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
but smaller

1693
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But its amount and duration are much larger

1694
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
because it has no discretion

1695
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
so much better

1696
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
of course you have to cool it

1697
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
you need a cooling system

1698
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
OK but the confusion of high temperature superconductors

1699
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Let's talk about its confusion now

1700
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
this all sounds good

1701
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
But we found a lot of strange things

1702
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
This is a picture we made ourselves

1703
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I asked my postdoc to go and look up those things

1704
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
what does this picture mean

1705
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
This is its superconducting transition temperature

1706
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,440
with it at room temperature right now

1707
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,040
If you measure its resistivity

1708
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,640
you take log

1709
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,200
Because the number is far from

1710
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
many times

1711
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,040
So with this scheme, the difference is 10 to the power of one

1712
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,840
This is 10 to the power of -1

1713
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,160
This 10 to the power of -2

1714
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,040
Resistivity

1715
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,040
Then you can see these new

1716
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,000
superconducting iron

1717
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,040
all in this paragraph

1718
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,840
are high resistivity

1719
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,800
But they usually also have a higher TC

1720
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,680
But this one is old like quicksilver

1721
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,000
The 23 degrees mentioned just now are all here

1722
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,680
TC is lower here

1723
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,880
But its resistivity is very low at room temperature

1724
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,200
means it's a good metal

1725
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:48,200
You measure it at room temperature and say these are good metals

1726
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,680
these are bad metal

1727
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,760
Later found another MGB2

1728
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,200
See it is the same as the old one

1729
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,720
Its resistivity is also very low

1730
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,120
just at room temperature

1731
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,640
These are good conductors

1732
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,120
can be used for normal

1733
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
the same wire or something

1734
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
this is very good

1735
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
But this is all bad

1736
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Here's a weirder one

1737
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
very complicated

1738
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
This is called organic

1739
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
organic superconductor

1740
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Stranger and Larger Molecules

1741
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
very complicated

1742
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
This is also very resistive

1743
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
But the temperature is also around 20 degrees

1744
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So it's kind of weird

1745
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Usually we think

1746
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
More conductive metals should be better at superconducting

1747
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
that was the old idea

1748
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
BCS also predicts like this

1749
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But now I find that this kind of new ones are not

1750
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
It's a bad resistor

1751
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
very bad

1752
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
On the contrary, superconducting temperature is very high

1753
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
this is strange

1754
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
The other is that these are bilingual systems

1755
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
is copper

1756
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You see copper is a plane

1757
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
another plane

1758
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
another circle

1759
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
The main superconductivity is in the copper plane

1760
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
The main superconductivity is in the iron plane

1761
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
most

1762
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,400
They all look like two-dimensional systems when their electrons move

1763
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,800
It's not three-dimensional, so it's very different from before

1764
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:08,800
some features of this

1765
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,800
Something else weird is that these superconducting states

1766
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:16,800
If you dope you can make it superconducting or not superconducting

1767
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,800
But it's all similar to this magnetic

1768
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,800
This phase diagram is if I put different numbers to replace a certain atom

1769
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:27,800
If silk is used instead of blue, if it is replaced by a little

1770
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,000
The more I replace, the more I become superconducting

1771
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Instead of a little I am antiferromagnetic

1772
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
is magnetic

1773
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Upper wisdom and lower wisdom are ranked

1774
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
one up next next up

1775
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
It is equal to the blue, red, blue and red gold grids arranged well

1776
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
a square square

1777
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Next to your blue is red

1778
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
blue next to red

1779
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
This is a well-arranged antiferromagnetic

1780
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
But if you put a little more in it, it becomes superconducting

1781
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
But it's so close

1782
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Another point is that the product superconductivity of iron is the same

1783
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,640
they have many similarities

1784
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,000
But this is a phenomenon that the old superconductors did not have before.

1785
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,140
The farther away they are from persistence the better

1786
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,740
So there is no persistent material

1787
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,440
But this persistence is quite high

1788
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,140
The sustaining temperature is actually quite high, 300 degrees here

1789
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,540
so strong persistence

1790
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:18,140
But instead a very high superconducting temperature

1791
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,340
this is very strange

1792
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,840
This is the Waterfall team I was talking about

1793
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,000
don't like holding sex

1794
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,540
What did you do, persistent

1795
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:28,120
The organic superconductivity just mentioned

1796
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,840
also near here

1797
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,640
All the shopkeepers around here have poor sight temperatures

1798
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,580
don't even think about it

1799
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,040
because it has persistence in it

1800
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,540
bumping, bumping, bumping

1801
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,840
so it doesn't like

1802
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,440
But its superconducting temperature is very high

1803
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,440
Of course everyone thinks about it

1804
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,840
how do i solve this problem

1805
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,740
How can I help form a CooporPair

1806
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,040
Coopor team

1807
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,240
possible communication we have already talked about reproduction

1808
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,440
Of course everyone wants to do theory

1809
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,740
Of course you can sit at home and think a lot

1810
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,200
We also did this plasma

1811
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,280
Plasma

1812
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,280
Plasma

1813
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
You don't understand, it means you have a lot of batteries

1814
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Because positively charged ions are on the grid

1815
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Then you have electrons that can run around and it can go the right way

1816
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Collective Righteous Way It is not just one or two electricity, many electric righteousness

1817
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Of course, if there is the right way, there will be more batteries here.

1818
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
There is less battery over there, less battery looks like righteousness

1819
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Positive and multi-battery, this kind of positive way can also cause two batteries

1820
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Of course, this has never been found. This is a theory that is often said.

1821
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And then there's another one that we notice because electrons also have a magnetic moment

1822
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
We just mentioned that there is a magnetic whirl, so we have the body just mentioned

1823
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Everything uses the force of cool people because it uses electric charges

1824
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
We did not talk about the influence of the magnetic moment, if there is a magnetic moment

1825
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
It can also work by itself, just the magnetic force of the magnetic wire is working

1826
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
It doesn't have to rely on the effect of charge, so there are other possibilities.

1827
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Then this is what I just said about high temperature exceeding the body. We just talked about it.

1828
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:00,000
This is the super-body mentioned by Naobiao.

1829
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,800
Replaced a little bit with back heel silk

1830
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,600
If not it's as simple as

1831
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,920
very nice a jingle

1832
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,920
well arranged

1833
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,320
The red inside is copper

1834
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,520
next to copper is oxygen

1835
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:15,120
Below the middle is a large pile of this blue or stone

1836
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,920
Blue if you want Ginger not

1837
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,400
That's copper oxide again

1838
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,680
Copper Oxygen Plane Again

1839
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,560
if so

1840
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,160
I drew all the copper planes

1841
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:24,200
it is each with a word string

1842
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,200
This is the anti-iron pool I just mentioned

1843
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,200
one up one down one up one down

1844
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,400
Well lined up

1845
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,120
This is its anti-iron pool

1846
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,720
But in fact we remember

1847
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,280
We are in a quantum world

1848
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,480
Quantum doesn't like things that don't move

1849
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,280
Didn't I say it just now?

1850
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,200
it doesn't like you not moving

1851
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,600
High energy due to motionless

1852
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,480
This sea cucumber treasure is not sure how far away

1853
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,440
so what does it do

1854
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,960
It still needs to exchange the two

1855
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,840
You can imagine everyone doing row after row

1856
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,920
Well done Blue Red Blue Red Ginger

1857
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,480
Swap the blue one with the red one

1858
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,880
exchange over there again

1859
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,600
swap it and swap it back

1860
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,000
just keep swapping

1861
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,160
it swaps to go , but an average of one-fifth swaps again

1862
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,000
If you take a photo at any time, about one-fifth of it is an exchange

1863
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
But most of them are in the right place

1864
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,800
This is probably the state when it is half full.

1865
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,600
This is because of quantum effects, making it exchange

1866
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,600
This exchange is like what you just said, think about it, it's like red

1867
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
but it can't run very far

1868
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,600
because it's coming back soon

1869
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,700
It's in the wrong place, the energy is a little higher

1870
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,700
so it likes to come back, after a while it jumps back

1871
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,300
But it's not okay to stay still, so it jumps around

1872
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,100
This is a very simple quantum action

1873
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:42,700
Now if we use back or silk instead

1874
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,900
There were originally three blue planes, but two on the back

1875
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,300
So it has one less electron

1876
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,300
So there are fewer electrons in it.

1877
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,100
The same surface suddenly lost an electron

1878
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,900
It means that there is a hole, that is, the electron is removed.

1879
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,100
it has an extra hole

1880
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:59,900
that's even better

1881
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,860
Because he just said he doesn't like to stop there

1882
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,160
He just jumps right into the hole now

1883
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,540
He has one more, the emperor can jump to the vacant seat

1884
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,460
So as soon as you have a void

1885
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:12,460
He started to play a little more role

1886
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,060
In addition to electron up-spin down-spin exchange

1887
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,060
he can jump with holes

1888
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:18,760
he keeps jumping

1889
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,260
This jump is great

1890
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,700
Because of jumping, this arrangement is gone.

1891
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,060
As you can imagine, there are a lot of vacancies now

1892
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,140
If you are a blue building and the next door is red

1893
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,500
You are now asking you to change chairs

1894
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,200
It won't be a mess after a while

1895
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,500
All of a sudden, the neatly arranged golden grids disappeared.

1896
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,600
gone soon

1897
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,900
Of course it was broken up with this

1898
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,500
He can move around again

1899
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,740
Now the team can

1900
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:45,000
not only in the original place

1901
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
It turns out that you are all near

1902
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,340
I can run far now

1903
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:51,800
this team can run

1904
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,600
This dry foil team starts again

1905
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:54,960
like the one i just said

1906
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,560
The situation where the dance was drawn

1907
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,500
he can run far

1908
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:00,000
because now there are

1909
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
If there is a hole, you can't run far without a hole, and if there is a hole, it's easy to run

1910
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,000
This spaced one, this adjacent one, this one because of fanning

1911
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
So there isn't such a strong force to keep him in the same position

1912
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
so he can run around

1913
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Then dance with the Cooper team that we were talking about

1914
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Come to think of it, it's actually very close

1915
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It doesn't make a difference because he's doing the same thing

1916
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
One up, one down, one up and one down exchange over there

1917
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
he is going to run

1918
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
That, that, that, when he said it like this, it would be resolved, it was the reason for the guidance

1919
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Of course it's not that simple, because if you take a closer look

1920
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
He still has a lot to crawl, but I don't talk about so much confusion today

1921
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
He has a lot of confusion, if you look carefully at any time, you will be confused

1922
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
There is a very important experiment, which is the reason for the development of Naimi Technology

1923
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I just invented this, this, that is a picture number I copied from someone else’s online inspection

1924
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
This is called Scanning internally my...

1925
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
scanning through sleep microscope

1926
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
it has a very real extension

1927
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
This is your original sample

1928
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
If you add a little bit of voltage to the current

1929
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
There are electrons that wear and sleep from here

1930
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
what can this do

1931
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
can measure its height

1932
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
each of which can be measured

1933
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
In particular, different electron densities are different

1934
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
it can measure anything

1935
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
This is called STM

1936
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
叫Scanning internally micro

1937
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
This is the work that won the Nobel Prize

1938
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
The whole nanotechnology starts here

1939
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Then if you read what I just said

1940
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
High temperature superconducting samples

1941
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You see what it measures

1942
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
under the same voltage

1943
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
This current is very uneven

1944
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
If you look closely, it is very uneven

1945
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's a bit like we're uneven here

1946
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
very messy

1947
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
the one i was talking about

1948
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Ordinary superconductors are different

1949
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Normal superconductors are perfect

1950
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
This is superconducting too cool

1951
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
it's very uneven

1952
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Then carefully put this into these ten nanometers

1953
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
you make it bigger

1954
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,400
This is only four nanometers

1955
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,600
you make it bigger

1956
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,400
Zoom in again

1957
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:06,760
it looks at every atom

1958
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,360
every copper atom

1959
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,600
between two atoms

1960
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,760
you are uneven

1961
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,160
this is incredible this measurement

1962
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,120
we have a colleague now

1963
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,400
There are ways to measure more like this

1964
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,120
This makes its measurement

1965
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,000
measure out

1966
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,600
These are uneven

1967
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,000
Electrons are not uniform in this

1968
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,200
This is like the dance I just mentioned

1969
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,000
there's more in dancing

1970
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,800
more complicated

1971
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,000
here's this jump time

1972
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
There is a group of people walking to the left

1973
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,200
There is a group of that Couple going to the right

1974
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,000
So I will think a lot here

1975
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
less here

1976
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,400
Just started everyone has updated shots

1977
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,900
Not only did it jump like this

1978
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:51,000
It also has a certain mutual motion with each other

1979
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,200
that's what you can imagine

1980
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,000
Some earth dances are so complicated

1981
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,400
Jumping is so complicated

1982
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,200
This electron does complicated things

1983
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,000
it's still uneven

1984
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,800
It's in Cao Daotai, so this is very novel

1985
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:08,500
This is the old one from the past, it is the traditional Caodao, and it is completely non-existent

1986
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:11,500
Impossible things are here

1987
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,500
It started to have various variations again

1988
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,000
This is what I just mentioned above

1989
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,500
When the force is very strong, the force here is of course very strong

1990
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:24,500
The force of Kuren is very strong, this is a very strange thing

1991
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,500
The strong Kuren force has a very high Caodao temperature

1992
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:33,000
That's the complete opposite, completely different from what we usually imagine

1993
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,500
So in the bcs theory here is a big problem

1994
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,500
Now everyone believes that probably the bcs theory cannot explain this phenomenon

1995
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:46,500
The main reason is that there is complexity

1996
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,000
Far beyond this simplest theory

1997
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So this is why we have been studying this for so many years

1998
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:58,000
Now we understand that the electricity and number of this are different here

1999
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,500
everything is different

2000
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
We haven’t measured this until the experiment. We can tell him that it’s different.

2001
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Now let's finally talk about higher superconducting temperatures.

2002
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
There are several possibilities, one is to find new materials

2003
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Then this is a new one just mentioned, this is actually just now

2004
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
This is the first quick delivery made by Academician Wu Maokun.

2005
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
People develop it into a plane

2006
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,000
This is an incredible technique on one material

2007
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I don’t know how to say this in Chinese Stranding Titanium Oxide

2008
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
On top of this material, grow a layer on a very thin material

2009
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It is one layer of iron and T, iron and C, one layer of iron C

2010
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Then they measure the superconducting temperature, there are many papers

2011
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It came out in this journal that the superconducting temperature should reach 100

2012
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
09 degrees

2013
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,780
it must be shaken to death

2014
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:05,540
But 65 degrees is probably no problem.

2015
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,540
109 degrees will shock you to death

2016
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:11,780
But that temperature is only 8 degrees higher than the original temperature of this thing

2017
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:13,480
It's time to make a wish without fainting

2018
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,980
That temperature is only 8 degrees

2019
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,480
Now people use this method

2020
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,180
When it is not the same as it is made

2021
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,180
why?

2022
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,380
that may be new physics on this surface

2023
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,280
This is the mechanism we just disturbed

2024
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,180
This is what experiments tell us

2025
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,780
The temperature here is much, much higher than before.

2026
01:20:29,780 --> 01:20:31,780
This mechanism may not be the original

2027
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,780
Then it has a new possibility

2028
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,780
that's certainly possible

2029
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:40,780
Because it is possible that the biomass here has a great influence on it

2030
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:44,780
But here the biomass influence is very large causing this electron

2031
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:45,780
because it is compartment

2032
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:46,780
The electron is still here

2033
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:48,780
So I didn't trap it very hard

2034
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,780
Didn't dig it deep just now

2035
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,780
so it can run fast

2036
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,780
But electrons are strong

2037
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:59,780
So it is possible that its superconducting temperature increases

2038
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,000
This lead is a hot end of term doing research

2039
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
You can see that this paper is very popular at the end of the term

2040
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
This guide pull is an interesting idea

2041
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Some people have thought about using this interface to control

2042
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
an electron in a layer

2043
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
that rope is on another layer

2044
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
or positively charged on another layer

2045
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Your negative charge is on another layer

2046
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
How to control? This Nimi technology is here

2047
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
We can now control the material

2048
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Think of ways to make a variety of such interfaces to

2049
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
This can also increase the operating temperature

2050
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Another more exciting thing is that under high pressure

2051
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Just now we said that increasing the high pressure is a

2052
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But this high pressure is as high as 200GP

2053
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
There are only a few in the world

2054
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Someone use this ability to do this high pressure

2055
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
The person who mainly made this

2056
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I used to do a post with that Wang Heguangyuan

2057
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Aremes

2058
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,840
they recently discovered

2059
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,000
Everyone thinks of Liu Huaqing smelling bad

2060
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,880
In Jiang Mishan, you may often smell some

2061
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,360
This is of course poisonous proof

2062
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,080
not good

2063
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,800
very bad gas

2064
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:15,920
this is fine now

2065
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,040
Squeeze the shit out of it

2066
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,960
Physicists are crazy

2067
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,160
Of course it makes sense

2068
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:23,960
squeeze it down

2069
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,400
He said 200 shower 3 degrees

2070
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,600
Oops

2071
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,040
Of course if he's proven right

2072
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,200
This is the job Noble talked about again.

2073
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,480
But this problem is difficult to prove

2074
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:37,280
Because few people have 200

2075
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,840
Gagapet kettle

2076
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,280
This instrument and especially complex

2077
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,920
he does

2078
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,720
This is of course an early theory

2079
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:45,920
let me talk about theory

2080
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,440
Anyway, it doesn't cost anything

2081
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,360
Said that maybe in such a material

2082
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,360
Kiyomi

2083
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,680
Because everyone thinks clearly

2084
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,040
So vibrate so much

2085
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,640
high frequency of vibration

2086
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,020
Farmers’ comments are also very high, which is related to the BCS theory just mentioned

2087
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:06,400
It is easy to operate and the temperature will increase

2088
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,100
That is what I want to say, if farmers are not orthodox, they must not operate

2089
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,200
The more orthodox, the better

2090
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,100
The higher the comment, the better

2091
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,700
So very early on Prediction said

2092
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,800
Theoretically speaking, it’s more than three hundred. Of course, no one believes it when they come here often

2093
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:22,800
How could it be more than 200 or 300 to do this job?

2094
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,500
But these they do, of course I don't know if this is this

2095
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:31,500
Of course this is, because everyone knows that it is easy for electrons to escape

2096
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,900
But it is also easy to become H-minor, there are two electrons coming

2097
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,200
one more electron

2098
01:23:36,900 --> 01:23:38,300
So it's kind of like Cooper Pet

2099
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,900
From here to here there is a couple

2100
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,600
so this is interesting

2101
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,300
Is there an extra physics

2102
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,000
Not so simple physics

2103
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,600
Of course this has not been confirmed

2104
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,300
I'm just talking, that is to say, I have some new ideas

2105
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,100
That is, if we find a stronger force

2106
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,800
It is not necessary to say that we cannot

2107
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:00,000
But of course how do you prevent what I just said

2108
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,800
nothing else to add

2109
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,600
because you tied it too tight

2110
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,200
It's simple and it's not too tight

2111
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,900
Because the person itself will vibrate very much

2112
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:08,400
so maybe not tied too tight

2113
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,800
It's hard to tie a kiss too tight

2114
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,800
because it is very light

2115
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,600
So the problem is under this

2116
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,700
There may also be other operators

2117
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,800
Of course you will often see it in newspapers

2118
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,100
And who found another operator

2119
01:24:25,100 --> 01:24:27,400
this will be a lot

2120
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:29,800
we used to joke a lot

2121
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,800
this is called

2122
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,400
We are called UFO and everyone knows that

2123
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,400
Unidentified Flying Object

2124
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,200
It's just an unidentified flying object.

2125
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,000
what is flying

2126
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,400
We often say that this superconducting world also has

2127
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,800
USO Unidentified Superconducting Object

2128
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,800
superconducting

2129
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:48,800
many people posted

2130
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,300
i see 300 degrees

2131
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,300
I saw 200 for a while

2132
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,400
head pass

2133
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,100
haven't found it for so many years

2134
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:57,600
But of course there is some evidence here

2135
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,000
Some of its rugs still look obvious

2136
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,820
But it's obviously early. Why on earth?

2137
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,120
I don't know if it's really too high

2138
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,360
But this question

2139
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:10,460
Lume Temporary called this dream

2140
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,260
i think we'll always have

2141
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,800
I thank you all for this

2142
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,600
I also thank my assistants

2143
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,660
Professor Chen Yingqian gave me a lot of slides

2144
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:22,060
Principal Wu Maokun gave me some slides

2145
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,660
but thanks for their help

2146
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,660
thank you all

2147
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:29,260
Okay, thank you

2148
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,660
well timed

2149
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:33,660
good

2150
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,660
you

2151
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,660
Do you have any questions?

2152
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,160
or

2153
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:38,960
please

2154
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,460
Thank you teacher for a very wonderful speech

2155
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:44,860
Let me first admit that I am a student of biology

2156
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:45,860
so

2157
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:48,460
I don't really understand the details

2158
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,360
but in my mind

2159
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:51,760
I used to send

2160
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,100
It has been said since the beginning of the year

2161
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,160
start as a single atomic material

2162
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,260
Later, it gradually became multi-atomic

2163
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,860
In my impression, at that super high temperature

2164
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,200
When the super-heated high temperature jumps

2165
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,720
It seems to have been predicted

2166
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,320
the composite material

2167
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,600
Is the atom in it replaced by which one?

2168
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,520
it may become high temperature

2169
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,200
Then it was math

2170
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,880
Forget it, which element may be extrapolated later

2171
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,640
The substitution was successful.

2172
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,480
That's especially new from what you introduced today

2173
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,600
Two cases in 2015

2174
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,920
that's what i think

2175
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,480
i think at that time

2176
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:27,800
Of course they're a bit disrespectful

2177
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,520
This is quite a lot

2178
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,440
The blue quilt is the same one that won the Nobel Prize

2179
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,960
he is not for this reason

2180
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,840
His reason is not calculation

2181
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:40,280
His idea was to increase the effect of electroplasma

2182
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,400
he knows this

2183
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:42,400
usually this

2184
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,480
These are ceramic materials weird

2185
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,040
I just talked about these new high temperatures

2186
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,480
The Blue Bell of Taobao body is the same

2187
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,000
Mao Kun Zhu Jin Weapon

2188
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,080
they found out

2189
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,440
ceramic material is very fragile

2190
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,840
That's what you can't imagine saying

2191
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,160
it becomes superconducting

2192
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,520
but he made it superconducting

2193
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,120
So they know that there are electric

2194
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
So the original Bandau's Mule was for electric birth to many people

2195
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
He did it to see if the temperature was up to

2196
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
As a result, he found that the temperature was very high

2197
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Of course, now we know that he has nothing to do with the effect of electrogenesis

2198
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
It's not for that reason that it becomes over

2199
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
but usually the right answer for the wrong reasons

2200
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
That's okay too

2201
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
This is what science is all about.

2202
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Then he is single, you just talked about calculating

2203
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,000
In fact, many people have calculated many materials and said that the temperature is very high

2204
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Experiments that were wrong at first proved to be wrong

2205
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
we are not right yet

2206
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
So I just said the last one, I don’t know if it’s right

2207
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Most of them are 99% wrong

2208
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
what you imagine is not real

2209
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Yeah, I want to ask this too

2210
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Because that microscope that just looked at that tunnel

2211
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It looks like another rule

2212
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
You also mentioned that it may have another physical law

2213
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
In fact, it is not clear

2214
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
have what

2215
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
another physical phenomenon

2216
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That is, can these be described by mathematics?

2217
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I think the extrapolated way

2218
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
is described by mathematics

2219
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,240
you don't really quantify

2220
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,840
Then you can't really predict

2221
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,440
Many experiments are useless

2222
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,040
theory is to quantify

2223
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,640
It is useful to predict

2224
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,440
So all the talking things have to be spread out

2225
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,640
only useful

2226
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,040
so must

2227
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,040
so even though

2228
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,600
I talked about such a miraculous quantum state

2229
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,840
macroscopic quantum state

2230
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,440
Giants are rare

2231
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,640
Then this is beyond

2232
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,080
If in the test

2233
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,240
I say this

2234
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:32,240
so it's a big deal

2235
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,480
because only

2236
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:37,040
Only after sniffing our little quantum mechanics

2237
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,000
should not be very important

2238
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,720
Then if there is a huge amount

2239
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,880
Of course it's a great thing

2240
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,080
this is difficult

2241
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,840
Because the quantum state must

2242
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,720
should be kept at a very low temperature

2243
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,880
small size

2244
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,280
but now it's about

2245
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,480
It was a big size just now

2246
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,640
you have seen

2247
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:59,080
The performance of the quantum state

2248
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,920
This is likely to have more

2249
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,400
So we wish to find the temperature

2250
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:07,820
All four temperatures are superconducting

2251
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,700
You have to reheat it so it doesn't superconduct

2252
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,700
this is dream

2253
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:17,100
It would be a very good thing if it came out

2254
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,880
This is still difficult

2255
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:20,720
There are a lot more

2256
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,760
Of course it is because of difficulties

2257
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,740
we have research to do

2258
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:26,460
please

2259
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:28,660
ask the professor

2260
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:32,900
The one that just experimented with the one that floated

2261
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,900
It's also called the principle of Chifu

2262
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:36,180
Yes or no

2263
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:36,580
right

2264
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:41,500
Excuse me, the rotten train in Japan that you just introduced

2265
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:42,860
this is the principle

2266
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:45,060
So that means their train is running

2267
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,220
Will there be a lot of smoke?

2268
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:48,820
No

2269
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:49,380
certainly

2270
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:51,260
we can't help it

2271
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,540
if we cover you up

2272
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:56,780
Then put another train on top of it

2273
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,740
Toys can be compared and analyzed like this

2274
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,020
Put another toy on top

2275
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,400
You can't see the train from above

2276
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,240
just sealed it up inside

2277
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,080
that liquid doesn't evaporate

2278
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:08,640
it has a cooling system all closed

2279
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,400
This way it will last longer

2280
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,260
This cooling system

2281
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:13,560
So probably save this

2282
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:14,760
it keeps it sealed

2283
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:15,760
you can't see the smoke

2284
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,680
So their shameful car is going

2285
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,440
smoke is invisible

2286
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:22,040
we taiwan

2287
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,280
I remember almost 20 years ago

2288
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:29,400
That explosive magazine has talked about this shameful car

2289
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:31,800
But to this day, there is still no Taiwan

2290
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:33,240
then ask the professor

2291
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:37,560
Will there be superconducting cars in the future?

2292
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:38,000
Thanks

2293
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,080
Japan is ready to build one

2294
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:46,560
from tokyo to i think it was osaka

2295
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,920
This is already a national strategy

2296
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,200
It's going to build this in 2025

2297
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,240
superconducting car

2298
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,080
right

2299
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,560
Of course it is not completely superconducting now

2300
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:00,240
i listen now

2301
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,200
Sounds like it's not exactly hot tide

2302
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,840
I said it also uses some low temperature tide

2303
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,000
it has some hybrid designs

2304
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,300
Because all use high temperature tide

2305
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,100
can be expensive now

2306
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,240
too expensive

2307
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,240
so it may now have a

2308
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,600
But this cryogenic industry

2309
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,740
It is Japan's century-old plan

2310
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:18,040
Japan now has

2311
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,640
Japan seems to like to make a hundred-year plan

2312
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,460
planning

2313
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,000
Then it has a big plan

2314
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,160
cryogenic industry

2315
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,940
become the most important industry in their country

2316
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:28,900
What is cryogenic industry

2317
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,000
That is, making many things is related to low temperature

2318
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,700
There are many benefits of low temperature

2319
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:36,060
So what are they going to do with these low temperature

2320
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:40,460
So build this superconducting train

2321
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,700
is the plan of one of its elephants

2322
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,360
so you just mentioned

2323
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,900
The high temperature tide guide and the low tide guide

2324
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:51,200
The cost of low temperature tidal conduction is much lower

2325
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,760
because it's been years

2326
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:53,140
Done

2327
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:56,360
Therefore, the trouble caused by high temperature tide is just mentioned

2328
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:59,920
That is, it is more fragile than it is a ceramic material

2329
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,760
OK, the other Mr. Lu, these are good materials

2330
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,160
It's easier to do, the same

2331
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,560
I mean those blue pill cakes

2332
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:13,040
The ingredients of the blue medicine cake just mentioned are relatively easy to make

2333
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,600
less easy to consume

2334
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:17,880
Yes, it is not easy, because it is relatively flexible and flexible to make this kind of

2335
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,920
You know the cable, you say you can bend it

2336
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,680
It's broken after a bend, it's okay

2337
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,560
That electric current is incredible, so it absolutely cannot happen

2338
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,400
When doing this kind of thing is the most difficult to apply

2339
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,080
safety is the most important

2340
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,400
But security is

2341
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,840
Many problems with shooting are not physical problems

2342
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:37,320
It's about mechanics and engineering.

2343
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:38,400
that's hard

2344
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:42,280
So why did he only do one kilometer for so many years?

2345
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:45,680
The long is what you want to do so long

2346
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:46,680
pull such a long line

2347
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,440
Everyone you can bend, right?

2348
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,720
The cable can't be bent

2349
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:51,160
It must be able to bend, right?

2350
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:54,280
then you will be fine

2351
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,400
that is difficult

2352
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:57,840
Of course they've been improving and you can see that.

2353
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,720
These countries are doing their best

2354
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,200
always improving

2355
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,160
Because this is a big industry

2356
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,040
Who can do it? It's a very good job, of course.

2357
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,960
whoever has a very big industry

2358
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,160
this is no problem

2359
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,120
so this is what they do

2360
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,240
Taiwan does not have this aspect

2361
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,040
thank you professor thank you

2362
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,360
I would like to ask you, Professor, what you just said

2363
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,520
CurvePair is electronics and childbirth

2364
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,320
Its interaction causes overrun to

2365
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,320
but my problem is

2366
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:37,800
When you use a single or a single cooling down to 1K 2K

2367
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,400
At this time, giving birth should be

2368
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,000
Your Ginger should not vibrate

2369
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,360
That is, childbirth should be fixed there.

2370
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,840
I just can't

2371
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,000
Just understanding is how the electronics interact with the child at this time

2372
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,680
This is what I just said

2373
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,240
absolute temperature zero

2374
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:00,240
The atoms and ions will still oscillate

2375
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
this is quantum mechanics

2376
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Otherwise, the uncertainty principle is violated

2377
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
We all know the uncertainty principle

2378
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
is that you must never have a thing

2379
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
my position

2380
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
The position of space is immobile

2381
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
because if you don't move at all

2382
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,000
The kinetic energy of that thing is infinite

2383
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
unlimited

2384
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
is impossible

2385
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
so it must move

2386
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
will definitely move

2387
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:35,000
So why is superconductivity so difficult to say?

2388
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
That is, it is all related to quantum mechanics

2389
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
It's all about quantum mechanics

2390
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Classical mechanics is completely inexplicable

2391
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Of course it was 1911 and no one wanted to appreciate

2392
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
After I understand quantum mechanics, I want to say

2393
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
This is a full quantum

2394
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Then you just said it will still move

2395
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
you can't keep it from moving

2396
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
this is impossible

2397
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,560
So this shock is bound to happen

2398
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:05,920
That's how it is

2399
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:06,960
this is

2400
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,840
he sounds bad

2401
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,240
Actually it's his benefit

2402
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:13,560
There are so many strange phenomena

2403
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,760
If it could happen in the quantum world

2404
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,040
These strange phenomena will all appear

2405
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,400
He has a new statement

2406
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:27,840
Not the usual world we are familiar with

2407
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
No

2408
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Can

2409
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
The teacher just mentioned superconductivity

2410
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
we take the battery away

2411
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
The current will still run inside

2412
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
May I ask if this situation is impossible?

2413
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
have what

2414
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
have what

2415
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That is to say, I made a machine

2416
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I don't need to attack its energy

2417
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
it can work forever

2418
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
But the current you just said keeps running

2419
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
it sounds like this

2420
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
that's because

2421
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
this is here

2422
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
because this is here

2423
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
It can manipulate state, it can use

2424
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
You can't talk about motivation

2425
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
If you use the motivation to say that you still want to use this

2426
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
if you put this, this, this

2427
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
The flywheel just mentioned is

2428
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
It's done now

2429
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Just steer it around

2430
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
The purpose of its rotation is to transfer kinetic energy

2431
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Because rotation is kinetic energy

2432
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
put energy in

2433
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
that can store a lot of energy

2434
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Because it depends on the volume and shape of your work

2435
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
can be very big

2436
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Then you put it in, how do you take it out?

2437
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Then you have to connect to another thing

2438
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
it will turn slower and slower

2439
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Because energy is conserved

2440
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
no motivation

2441
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
There is something wrong with this word

2442
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
This is not a motive here

2443
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Its energy is also conserved

2444
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Then if you take it off, it's gone

2445
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
OK, this is

2446
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Energy is always in balance

2447
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
OK, energy will never come out when you are empty

2448
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
There are several laws in this physics

2449
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
without exception

2450
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I would like to ask, does the current definition of superconductivity mean that its resistance must be zero?

2451
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Or when you said the number of degrees in the data just now?

2452
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Its resistivity also has a value, what does that mean?

2453
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
No, it has value in Siwenhao, but it has no value below a certain TCE, it is 0

2454
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:29,000
The so-called superconducting train used in Japan also uses this phenomenon of reaching zero to let...

2455
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:33,000
That's right, what you saw just now is the high-temperature superconductor here, and the spirited one floated up just now

2456
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:40,000
It is superconducting there. A few pieces of superconducting material here had a resistance of 0 at that time.

2457
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
That must be 0, that is, as I just said, it must be 0

2458
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Then if it is not 0, that thing will be taken soon, it will not run for so long

2459
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
It's just because of its metal, right, you... you need to get the battery

2460
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
It will have this man named Eddie Curran, which is what I just said

2461
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,300
It's gone in no time

2462
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,900
If you want to keep adding a lot

2463
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,200
A lot of your hands will be hot

2464
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,400
Because the metal will be hot

2465
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:09,100
They all turn into resistors and dissipate energy.

2466
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:10,600
but not here

2467
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,600
it just keeps running

2468
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,000
The only thing that didn't end up was because it evaporated

2469
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:17,800
take this liquid

2470
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,300
but evaporated

2471
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,100
it's not too early

2472
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:23,200
it warmed up

2473
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:23,900
it's not too early

2474
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,200
That's why the price stopped

2475
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,300
but the question just asked

2476
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,400
if i seal it up

2477
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,800
It's fine if it's sealed well

2478
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,500
Now there are many laboratories

2479
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,400
These liquids are all sealed.

2480
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:33,600
so it's been inside

2481
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,800
it doesn't evaporate

2482
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:38,500
that can be a long time

2483
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:40,300
then there is no such problem

2484
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,000
So why save energy

2485
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,200
Why do they think this is energy saving

2486
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,100
It saves electricity compared to usual current trains

2487
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,000
there is a reason

2488
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,100
You just need to close it up

2489
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,300
It's not that hard when the machine arrives

2490
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,000
you don't have to do it again

2491
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
don't add oil

2492
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,960
Oil sells nothing

2493
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:02,660
then ask again

2494
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:06,460
When the current of this material runs with zero resistance

2495
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,960
Is there any damage or consumption of this material?

2496
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:09,940
No

2497
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,460
as far as i know no

2498
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,160
because it doesn't hit anything

2499
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,260
No, you and I don't have resistors

2500
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:22,660
so it didn't hit the good stuff

2501
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:25,060
no way to consume it

2502
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,160
ok, is there any more

2503
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,000
But theoretically no

2504
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,660
Of course I don't know what your question is

2505
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:38,960
After your engineer

2506
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,000
it must still have some condition

2507
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,060
it's better

2508
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,000
the only thing is

2509
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,460
Yes, the only thing is in transform energy conversion

2510
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:47,960
Switch from this to another time

2511
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:50,000
There may be some energy savings there will be

2512
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Because you're not everything manipulative

2513
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,000
No

2514
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Because usually when the energy conversion

2515
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
You need to convert this energy

2516
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Energy summoned into another energy

2517
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
into electric energy or into mk

2518
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Of course you will have some provincial numbers

2519
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Energy summoning is like burning gasoline to become a machine leader

2520
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
You won't be 100% efficient

2521
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
The problem with this energy call

2522
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
But it itself has no province number energy

2523
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
But when you use it or facilitate it

2524
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Of course there will be some energy provinces

2525
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
it's inevitable

2526
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I want to ask the teacher

2527
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Is Ci Fu superconducting?

2528
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Or is it like the one from Shanghai Cifu?

2529
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Is it still a type of superconductor?

2530
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Yes, but it doesn't have to be superconducting

2531
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
that's what i just said

2532
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
first time i show that

2533
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
That is, you usually take a metal

2534
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Take a magnetist's back and go back

2535
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
In fact, there will be inverse

2536
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
you will

2537
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
if you are strong enough

2538
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
you'll feel it resist

2539
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
just be kind

2540
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
so which two

2541
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It is equal to South Pole to South Pole

2542
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
North Pole to North Pole can float

2543
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
But this thing is not very stable, just like what I said just now, it is not very stable,

2544
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Because you have to face it just right, and if you tilt it a little bit, you will be in trouble, and the trouble will be reversed.

2545
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:15,000
It's not very stable, but you can't do it without instability, stability is the most important thing.

2546
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:21,000
So I just said that another group repaired your superconducting hair, and it has the magnetic flux of the magnetic field line locked inside.

2547
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
So it is equivalent to having a thread inside, clamping it, so it is very stable,

2548
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Like the magnet just now, you can see that it is very stable, very stable, and if you look carefully, it is very stable, very stable,

2549
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:38,000
You can drill like this by yourself, right? It drills, you can see that it follows the magnetic force line,

2550
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It flew out without drilling that day, of course not so fast, but it can be seen that it drilled along this way,

2551
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
That's very strange, isn't it? People don't have a track, and it's nothing. Why does it drill along this?

2552
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Then if there is a superconducting train in the future, it will be safer than a running train.

2553
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Superconductivity is also a kind of surrender

2554
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
But wouldn't superconductivity be safer?

2555
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
More power saving, is it safer?

2556
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
But if it's more than 500 kilometers, I hope it's safe

2557
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
they are going to try now

2558
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
so why would they do it

2559
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I just saw that Japan was trying to make a one-kilometer-long

2560
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
have been trying for a long time

2561
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
This kilometer-long superconducting train

2562
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
right ? that of course is to try

2563
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Many are engineering problems

2564
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Actually speaking, many of those things are projects.

2565
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Of course, one is the issue of price, the other is the issue of engineering

2566
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Now mainly these two issues

2567
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I think it's probably technically resolved.

2568
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Because they also make cables, America makes so many cables

2569
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Also trying to test this problem

2570
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
That is to say, everything else is a supporting engineering problem now.

2571
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
is more important

2572
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Then the cost of this suit and the cost of superconductivity

2573
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
superconductor is more expensive

2574
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Superconductors are now more expensive

2575
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Yes, this high-temperature superconductor is of course more expensive to manufacture now

2576
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Of course it's also because he doesn't have mass production.

2577
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,500
Wait until they progress to mass production

2578
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:07,500
Of course it's different

2579
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
this is totally different

2580
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Of course countries are competing

2581
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,500
So the cost is the same for large quantities

2582
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,500
right

2583
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:18,500
The advantage is that the film energy saves a lot

2584
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:19,500
that's not noisy

2585
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:20,500
he floated

2586
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:21,500
that's fast, right?

2587
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,500
not noisy

2588
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:23,500
no sound

2589
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,500
Of course it's good, right?

2590
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,000
If it is floating in front

2591
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,500
I think it must be very comfortable to sit on

2592
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,500
I was wondering right?

2593
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:33,000
I sat in the one in Beishang

2594
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
That's not bad

2595
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Of course he wasn't fast enough.

2596
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
all at once

2597
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,000
but that's fine

2598
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
that floats is a good thing

2599
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
You said that it will be faster if you overtake it in the future

2600
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,500
will be faster

2601
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,000
certainly

2602
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Of course

2603
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Will

2604
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Technology is improving every day

2605
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
good last step

2606
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,500
Teacher, you just said that

2607
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,800
Energy conversion consumes energy

2608
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,360
But just now you have experienced so much

2609
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:07,000
The electrons are swapped again, this and that

2610
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,600
Then you said they were dancing together as a metaphor

2611
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,600
dancing is tiring

2612
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,800
Then why do they change their own words?

2613
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,800
Doesn't seem to consume energy

2614
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,600
No, this is the look of this super old lady

2615
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,000
It's not an exchange to exchange energy

2616
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,200
Because your electron is here, right?

2617
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:26,400
Then when I actually exchange like this

2618
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,700
when you swap with your neighbor

2619
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:29,800
You don't imagine it's tiring for you

2620
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,100
You have to change the chair with him, right?

2621
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,100
But I just said that for electronics

2622
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:36,600
He will be tired if he doesn't change

2623
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:44,100
Because of this Helenberg Uncertainty Principle

2624
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:46,600
On the contrary, it is very comfortable

2625
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,900
The more you change, the better

2626
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:52,300
So electrons in quantum teraroots

2627
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:56,100
Our usual thinking is wrong

2628
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,600
because in quantum too

2629
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,500
he is not sure

2630
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,400
That's how the uncertainty principle in mechanics sounds

2631
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,800
usually very simple

2632
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,800
In fact, the impact of the uncertainty principle is very far-reaching.

2633
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,600
this is

2634
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:11,000
Of course we don't know why nature

2635
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,400
uncertainty principle

2636
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:15,600
But it obviously has this principle

2637
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:17,300
And that's what you just said

2638
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:19,300
it gets better and better

2639
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:22,000
It doesn't like it and stays there

2640
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,000
is high energy

2641
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
so it won't happen

2642
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,700
in the real material

2643
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,100
this won't happen

2644
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:36,500
unless you have great strength

2645
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:37,500
hold it hard

2646
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,500
that's what i just said

2647
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:39,900
then it won't exceed

2648
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,100
Then this can't be helped

2649
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:43,900
Otherwise, it's best to change

2650
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:49,100
good i think

2651
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:51,300
director

2652
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:54,300
I just said that everyone is

2653
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,500
this is very well prepared

2654
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:59,500
Then I worked hard

2655
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:00,300
this

2656
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
take a very difficult question

2657
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
and let everyone know at least a little bit about

2658
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I am also very grateful to these two students

2659
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
this i just saw that

2660
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
The barrel of the liquid bomb is there

2661
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
That's a heavy thing to move here

2662
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
move all the props

2663
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I just hope you can get some

2664
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
At least some knowledge

2665
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
This achieves the purpose of our knowledge miss

2666
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Well, we are very grateful to Li Xiugang
