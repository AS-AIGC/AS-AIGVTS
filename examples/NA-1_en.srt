1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Men are more conservative than women

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
more traditional

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
the second

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
highly educated

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
less educated than

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
less conservative

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Turning into an adult is an objective determination

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
or subjective determination

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
did you say

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Be an adult girl by the age of eighteen

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you become an adult

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
because they feel

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This thing is a subjective determination

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He needs some objective indicators

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to match him

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
what do you mean by making your own decision

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
own responsibility

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is relatively simple

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So everyone thinks this is not enough

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I appreciate

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
over the years

22
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This plan

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Academia Sinica

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
main research plan

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and the Ministry of Science and Technology

26
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Previous NSC support

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and social institute

28
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Only when the funds are available can it last until now

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
we want to know

30
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The growth trajectory of contemporary young people

31
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
the second

32
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Timeline of our positioning

33
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
from a life course perspective

34
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
from early teens

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
traced to

36
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
his young adult stage

37
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The third

38
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of course we want to see

39
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Indigenous development model

40
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The pressure of entering a higher school

41
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Results of cram school, etc.

42
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Actually that's them

43
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
really a second way of life

44
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
At the beginning there were about 5,000 people

45
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
face method

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
so we are lucky

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
From our more than 5,000 samples

48
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
find some

49
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, just retro and teen

50
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
do some in-depth interviews

51
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so everyone can see

52
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Our sample is 2,000 years old

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Country One and Country Three

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The third year of the country was the last

55
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The last generation of candidates

56
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Country one is the new system

57
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
under the new system

58
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
in the top twenty-five percent

59
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Chances of attending star high schools

60
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
significantly high

61
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So indeed reform

62
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
yes bring some

63
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
greater inequality

64
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
family experience

65
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What we care about is a structure

66
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
a relationship

67
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
parents divorce

68
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the end the impact on children

69
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
what is it

70
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Here I will give you a report

71
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
College Graduation for Two-Parent Families

72
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
relatively high ratio

73
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
non-two-parent family

74
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Graduated from high school

75
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
relatively high ratio

76
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
so here

77
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There are some differences in education

78
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's just say family structure

79
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is there any effect

80
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
we know low birth rates

81
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this problem is serious

82
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and marriage

83
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Phenomena included

84
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,200
It means that the society still does not accept out-of-wedlock children

85
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
I remember when I was doing an interview

86
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,800
Respondents who were pregnant out of wedlock told me

87
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,200
He doesn't even want to marry him

88
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Because he thinks he can't get along with him, doesn't love each other

89
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Parents say I don't care if you love each other or not

90
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you hurry to get married

91
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,800
divorce after childbirth

92
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Why young people lack

93
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,500
Motivation for marriage and childbirth

94
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,000
this is what everyone is asking

95
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,500
Let's start with family experience

96
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,700
Early Family Experiences for Adolescents

97
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,800
Regardless of childhood and adolescence

98
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,100
Are the parents divorced?

99
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,400
In many Chinese families, the parents do not divorce

100
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,700
but conflicting

101
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,300
parent-child conflict

102
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,100
Early experiences of adolescence

103
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,800
Dating Behavior in Your Early Adulthood

104
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,100
what are the marriage expectations

105
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
especially in your 30s

106
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,300
We can talk about the actual act of marriage

107
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,700
usually tell you

108
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,800
His self-esteem comes first

109
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,300
bad grades wait

110
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,300
negative impact

111
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,500
and always tell you

112
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
will continue into adulthood

113
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
However, it is uncertain in the literature that

114
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,800
after parents divorce

115
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,500
Children are less willing to marry

116
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,600
Or get married early

117
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,960
Because if the child does not want to get married

118
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,200
because he sees conflict

119
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,360
Seeing that the parent-child relationship is not good

120
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,960
But some marry early

121
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,600
because he felt he needed a relationship

122
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,160
He comes from a place where resources are relatively scarce

123
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
He needs to get into marriage

124
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,640
We pay special attention to this divorced family

125
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,240
when he got divorced

126
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,520
Over 13 years old or under 22 years old

127
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,080
then go and see what's different

128
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,320
If parents divorced before the age of 13

129
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,240
Will affect pre-marital pregnancy of children

130
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,080
But it won't affect your early marriage

131
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,560
Parental conflict high in early teenage years

132
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,400
won't marry early

133
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,880
High parent-child conflict leads to early marriage

134
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,840
is it clear

135
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,800
But cohabitation and pre-marital relationship

136
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,480
more likely to marry early

137
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,120
If you are with a two-parent family

138
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,640
And the group with low conflict

139
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,680
Parents' Early Divorce Experience

140
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,560
lead to young adulthood

141
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,800
Negative effects of intimacy

142
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,960
then on the other hand

143
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,040
It is important to note that gender differences in the effect

144
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
very obvious

145
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
His family income was relatively high before he was young

146
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
good family relationship

147
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,600
And he currently has a job

148
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,040
He is more likely to be 28 years old

149
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
get married and give birth again

150
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,960
For women

151
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,160
If parents are divorced or separated

152
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,680
She is more likely to marry and have children

153
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,320
but adolescence

154
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,680
her family income is high

155
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,480
She currently has a job

156
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,200
she is less likely to marry

157
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,880
less likely to have children

158
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,120
If girls are fine

159
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,920
Compared with those who do not think that there are married

160
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,280
hope and desire

161
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,640
So what is the reflection of this thing for me?

162
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,680
Taiwanese family

163
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
In fact, many places

164
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
Or the impact between tradition and modernity

165
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,560
compromise there

166
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,760
because of our values

167
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
between our actions

168
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,200
some are persistent

169
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,360
some are constant

170
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,800
So if say Taiwan

171
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,760
and East Asian society

172
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,360
We are different from Europe and the United States

173
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,520
because you study a family in transition

174
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,240
Needs to go beyond your interpretation of personal resources

175
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,000
should also be considered

176
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,040
The interaction of cultural norms

177
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,280
Thank you Professor Yu

178
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,440
Please talk about Yujiao

179
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,060
you
