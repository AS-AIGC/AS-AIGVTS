1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,860
messed around he's nice

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,700
and

3
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:51,140
a

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,840
Today we are inviting Professor Zhong Sunlin from the Department of Geological Sciences, National Taiwan University

5
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,280
Then my child will introduce it

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,400
He was born in 1959 and is now 54 years old

7
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,280
I won't say anything about this girl

8
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,600
Then he received his Ph.D. from the Department of Geology, National Taiwan University in 1990.

9
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,840
We sometimes emphasize now and sometimes

10
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
The PhDs we train in Taiwan are also world-class.

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,200
He should be the same as our rebel headmaster Yang

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,760
That's called MIT

13
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,280
Mate in Taiwan

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
PhD is from Taiwan

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,640
Then the Ph.D. that I got now continues to teach at National Taiwan University

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,760
But from 1992 to 1993 to the University of Rennes in France

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,240
postdoctoral research

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,040
This one who came to Australia in 7 years

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,400
Tasmania is an island south of Australia.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,220
is an island twice the size of Taiwan

21
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,500
there are universities

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,300
that mineralogy is famous

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,560
where they visit

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,440
After returning to China, he has been teaching at National Taiwan University.

25
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,300
In 2001, our Central Plains Institute of Earth Sciences also

26
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,120
Incarceration Fellows at the Institute

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,000
His specialty is the dynamics of this geochemical

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
Phonics with Vulcan Circle

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,660
Probably today's speech probably has something to do with this

30
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,720
he took it three times

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,000
three times at most

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
Three Distinguished Research Awards

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,160
And this American Geological Society meeting

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,240
Then Ministry of Education Academic Award

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,800
Ministry of Education's National Award

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,640
Then Taiwan University Chaired Professor

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,200
most importantly international

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,020
National Science Council's Public Collaboration Research Program

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,900
Our National Science Council's Public Collaboration Research Program

40
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,900
is to train Taiwan's academic leaders

41
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,700
to the international level

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,300
His public policy is

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,200
This name is similar to the name of this project

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,400
This is probably what he wants to introduce today

45
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,100
the name is called

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
His public project is called

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Across Tibet to study Earth's in comparison

48
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,500
Three Generations Created by Two Collisions

49
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
This is more strict

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
or more academically

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
This is not an academic statement

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,400
and crossed Tibet

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
hug medical

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
research error

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,500
this enjoys the scenery

56
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,200
study geology

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
our warm applause

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,500
welcome is fair

59
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,300
Is there a sound?

60
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,000
have

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,600
Also share the introduction

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,100
thank you all

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,560
Everyone, I didn't expect so many people to come today

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,040
Teacher Peng said that I admire the teacher profession most in National Taiwan University

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,080
So he asked me to come and I couldn't refuse him

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
Actually, I'm not very good at giving customer service speeches.

67
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,720
But since it's here, there's a story in the middle

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,520
Let me just say by the way that you Xu made today's opening remarks

69
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,880
The contact for this speech was actually at the beginning of October last year

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,960
Vice President Peng's secretary will contact me

71
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,520
I just want him to contact me and say to contact me in early October

72
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,560
Then he said that he would make a speech at the end of October.

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,080
I just say

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,640
Oops, is that because the person in front didnâ€™t tell me to call me?

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,440
But because Mr. Peng wanted it

76
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
So I dare not refuse

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
I said ok then I'll come

78
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,000
That

79
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,080
When I made an appointment, I found out that he was actually talking about this year.

80
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,640
Contact in October last year will come this year

81
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,740
So I waited in line for a year to get here to speak

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,320
So you have to wait in line first

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,400
Actually, I should be going at this time

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,700
We're having that 125th annual meeting in Denver right now.

85
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,400
That special section with an Iranian address in it

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
The host originally asked me to give a talk

87
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,700
But I said I had scheduled a speech a year ago

88
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,800
so i can't go to that

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
I just have to come to this

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,700
what i want to talk about today

91
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,600
Because look at that time is two hours

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,700
I don't know how long I'm going to talk

93
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,500
But everyone line up

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Then I also sneaked to the Internet to have a look

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,600
Approximately how much time did the previous speaker spend

96
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
So of course I lined up 78 slides

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,200
78 slides in one

98
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,900
If each one speaks for one minute on average

99
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
I can speak for about 80 minutes

100
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,400
So I hope there is still some time to take your questions

101
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,000
But when I speak, I tend to speak faster and faster.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,300
The faster you speak, there are many things that may be unknown

103
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,700
or something unclear

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,600
if you would like to listen a little more

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,100
You are welcome to interrupt me anytime

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,300
I don't need to raise my hand

107
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,000
just press your microphone

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,400
call while i'm out of breath

109
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm willing to stop anytime

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,600
Let me explain a little more to you

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
or usually both

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,300
I heard they are very polite

113
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,500
according to the last

114
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,300
Bring it up when it's all said and done

115
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,400
bring it up for discussion

116
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,500
that's also very welcome

117
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,400
i want today

118
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,300
Just like Mr. Peng said just now

119
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,100
I went to Tibet to go to Youshan with Wulang to play in the water

120
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,200
Playing in the oil mountains and playing in the water is actually pretty good

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,300
This is the study of geology

122
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,900
one of the few advantages

123
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,400
I shouldn't have said that

124
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
one of the advantages

125
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,700
that I have been doing for many years

126
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,400
One of the studies on this

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm here to tell you today

128
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,500
The story of the so-called geological road project

129
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,000
at the beginning

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,400
use my old slide first

131
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,100
because of copyright issues

132
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,000
That idea was planned from

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
this gentleman is here

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
he is wal

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,700
He formed the so-called Music Project

136
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,100
Because of this server project

137
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,500
They have a certain Vision

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
we think we can borrow

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,500
It's all about effects

140
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,700
For this server project

141
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
For example they

142
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,000
I hope this can create a new form of music

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,100
so that he may feel he can escape

144
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,800
The family of classical music

145
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
or related category

146
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We want to come here to study this idea

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,100
do some geology research

148
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,200
Hope to make some new observations

149
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,700
Then finally the so-called

150
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,200
Noisy Mountain Collision Theory

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
some new insights

152
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,600
Even new ideas come

153
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,800
This is the Vision of our Stuff Effect

154
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,000
This thing actually happened in the past two or three years

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
To unlock a private project that may be the smallest for Taiwan compatriots

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This private project is the private plan of Yongbao in 2011 by our long-term insurance expert Lin Yujie

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They spent years preparing

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
spent three months on mobile

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
From Istanbul, Turkey

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then run east all the way to Lanzhou in mainland China and end

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A total of three months in the mainland within three months

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
as long as you play tv in Chinese

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Often see related reports

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They prepared for years and spent three months running him

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Our private program has been in existence for 17 or 18 years.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
run from Taiwan

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
First ran to Southeast Asia and then gradually ran to Tibet

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Finally started in the past six or seven years

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Further west into Iran into the elevated lock into TÃ¼rkiye

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The final destination so far is to go to Istanbul

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I am the opposite of everyone

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
16, 17, 18 years

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Or add my previous study schedule

174
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
The preparation process is actually

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've been running this my whole life

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,500
run this ultra run

177
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
Haven't run yet

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
Might as well run for a few years in the week until I

179
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,000
you can pick me

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Finally in line for a year or two

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Maybe there is still a chance to come and think about it with everyone

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then I want to introduce this thing

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
start with this

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
I heard someone say

185
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
The so-called Great Minds are discussing ideas

186
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Average MindsDiscussion events

187
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,500
As an old man, ask first

188
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Of course everyone doesn't like it

189
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
He is Great Minds

190
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
So he is discussing ideas

191
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
but when he was young

192
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
when he was young

193
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Small minds discuss people when I was young

194
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
So if start with

195
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
join this program

196
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
or me

197
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
People who do some cooperation started to introduce

198
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
because it's a

199
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
The study that spanned many countries

200
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
many different collaborators

201
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Then the middle is just the main collaborator

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
When including the Western Himalayas, partners from mainland China are required

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
When doing Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, and Malaysia are needed

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There are also some collaborators who are mixed with European and American people

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
when doing iran caucasus or turkey

206
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The same also needs to have some major local collaborators

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
opposite of name filing

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Of course, there is also the fellow who went to participate in Taiwan together

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Including several people from the Institute of Earth Sciences

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
teachers and other colleges

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Including teachers from Normal University and Chung Cheng University

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Finally, of course, my colleagues at National Taiwan University

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But the most important behind-the-scenes engineering

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Because there is no way to write a list of names here

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The main load is less complex than the backup load

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Follow me if the main load is too heavy

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Graduate students who have worked with me over the past ten years

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
PhD Fellow or Research Assistant

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
In fact, they played a very important role in the middle

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So I took the opportunity of today's speech by the way

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
A big thank you to these anonymous behind-the-scenes staff

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Before I introduce it, I may want to talk about the background of geology.

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Geological background we actually do research

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
are the major mountain ranges on earth to study

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
or major noise movement

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The main noise movements on Earth can be divided into two broad categories

227
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A class called Eccretionary

228
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Originate

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
aerated noise band or noise movement

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The typical representative is Mount Annis in South America

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Or the words that were secretly played by the north in the past

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The Heat Engine Mountains in North America are actually similar noise belts

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Their main mechanism is

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Party Ocean's ocean plate facing east screen

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Continental plates to North or South America

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is what is traditionally mentioned in the Plate Tectonics Society.

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
screen effect

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Continental translation is called complementarity

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Over the past ten years, we have worked with our classmates in mainland China

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,720
Many people cooperate a lot, and now many Chinese translations have become translations of Communist bandits.

241
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,720
I often forget what the translation for Taiwan is

242
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,320
In addition to the Occretionary Allusion type

243
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,520
In addition, there is a very important shape type called Colitional Allusion

244
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,520
In Chinese, it is called collision modeling.

245
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,520
A typical representative is the area to be introduced today

246
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,000
In fact, starting from Tibet in the Himalayas in the east and going west

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Passing through Parnell into Iran

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Then go west into the Caucasus Mountains

249
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,000
Inventory can be pushed all the way west to the Alps

250
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,400
Or the four mountains on the border between France and Spain

251
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,200
They represent land masses from the south

252
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,600
The modeling movement caused by the collision with the original Eurasian continent in the north

253
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,000
This shape is geologically related to my noun

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
called Pethean Allogenic Belts

255
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Chinese called Pethean Allogenic Belts

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,240
There used to be an ancient ocean called the Tethys Ocean.

257
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,640
I'll take a little time to introduce it later

258
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,760
so to discuss this

259
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
it is related to earth science or geology

260
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
over the past thirty to forty years

261
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,760
The most important theory is called plate

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,280
or one of the most important theories

263
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,840
The theory of plate tectonics is related to the proposal of the English name Playtronics

264
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,360
A doctrine or theory so far

265
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,680
still in geology

266
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,800
Or geosciences which play a certain important opinion

267
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,920
I take this opportunity to introduce two famous people

268
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,000
When they were in the early 1970s

269
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,520
This is the theory of plate tectonics

270
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,920
when it was first proposed

271
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,800
Started research into the so-called collision between India and the Asian continent

272
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,160
Like this is from an article they published in Science in 1975

273
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,720
the first to call the shots

274
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,960
Ugly caller now looks

275
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
but that is

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,840
The work result of the most Pioneer

277
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,960
Both gentlemen were at Masney College at the time.

278
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,800
Is a young scholar at MIT

279
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Peter Mona was the assistant professor at that time

280
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,840
Then Paul Taponeer was a postdoc from France

281
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,760
The two of them started a career at MIT

282
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,920
Then from this in India colliding with Eurasia in Tibet

283
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,880
A simterm was proposed in the study of Himalaya

284
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,320
called continental tectonics

285
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,480
They think continental tectonics and plate tectonics

286
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
are two completely different keys

287
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,440
It turns out that the plate that student or plate tectonics

288
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,640
It's the one from the oceanic plate

289
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,680
The theory developed in the study in the ocean

290
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,640
And they go on top of the continental plates

291
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,520
Or it is said in the actual propaganda research in the mainland

292
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,040
This study finds that it is not the same as in the ocean

293
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,800
So they have to make certain corrections

294
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,040
For example, continental plates can produce

295
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,700
It will produce deformation, contraction and expansion, and dragon fairy

296
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,700
that's why we have such big mountains, the himalals

297
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,700
Then there is such a big plateau behind, Jinzang Plateau Longqi

298
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,200
So this whole becomes the infinite situation of today's world

299
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Then over the past ten years of research here

300
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,100
In particular, the continental crust here

301
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
or the entire continental lithosphere, continental plates

302
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,600
Will it cause severe deformation?

303
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,400
with oceanic plates, or the traditional Play Deconics concept

304
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
is completely different, so they think

305
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,400
There is a new bucket face that needs to be studied in more detail

306
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Then the next thing I will do later will be related to the French relationship behind this

307
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,400
We have many, many wonderful entanglements with him now

308
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Then if you watch Play Deconics

309
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,200
this is one, could be one

310
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,200
New Models of America, Play Deconics, Play Boundaries

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,560
There are about 50 large and small plates on the surface of the earth

312
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,400
do mutual exercise each other squeeze each other

313
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,700
å‘ƒå‘ƒinteraction

314
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,000
then we will introduce

315
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,060
It's the little piece in the picture.

316
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,940
all

317
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Well

318
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,400
my thinking plan

319
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,280
if you

320
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,640
If you don't recognize this place

321
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,280
In fact, this place is mainly two

322
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,940
Well

323
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,760
Continental to Continental Collision

324
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,680
the one created by the orogen

325
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,980
uh mountains

326
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,860
is currently on Earth

327
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,980
most important

328
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,160
or the most

329
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,220
uh uh

330
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,020
conspicuous two colliding wars

331
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
one is here

332
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,320
yes this is tibet

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,060
Or with the mountains around Tibet

334
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,900
linked together

335
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,220
To the north is Space Mountain.

336
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,700
There is also Carat Space, to the south is the Himalayas

337
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,420
etc.

338
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,460
together this

339
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,520
I call it the Tibetan Himalayan War for short.

340
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,360
it is mainly

341
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,520
This section should be ruled

342
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,020
reciprocal motion to the north

343
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,520
Hitting the Eurasian road plate

344
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,420
The result of this place

345
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,820
What about its west side?

346
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,620
There's another Collision War zone

347
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,780
it is the arabic plate

348
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I bought most of them in Asia, and this place was made

349
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,720
These two states, if we use a little bit

350
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,900
It is a map projected from major earthquakes

351
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,400
Or if the earthquake takes it away

352
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
You can see that this color can actually come out

353
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
These two are to the east or west of Asia

354
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,900
I call it the East Asian collision zone for short.

355
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Collision with Western Asia Brings Humans

356
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,900
The most obvious difference is that this one is fatter

357
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,100
this is thinner

358
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,500
same principle

359
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
I used to be slim

360
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,900
But now it has become more and more like Mr. Peng

361
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm physically

362
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,900
so

363
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
This compares

364
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Compare

365
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Immense

366
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,900
then this

367
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
this

368
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
narrow

369
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
The time with which this crime took place

370
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
There are relationships

371
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,900
We call this collision zone a relatively mature collision zone.

372
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
because it started earlier

373
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
In geological history, probably

374
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
60 million years

375
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
That is, around 60 million years ago

376
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
India and Asia collide

377
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,900
This collision zone is a younger collision zone

378
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
it happened earlier

379
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
This time may be about 30 million years in the average concensus

380
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
It started only about 30 million years ago

381
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
So half younger than this

382
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
so this young

383
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,400
And at the same time, it has a lot to do with the speed and intensity of the picture drama that collides with the plate

384
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
Hardness runs fast

385
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
arabian run very slow

386
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,400
So if we look at this simple cartoon

387
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
The one who loves to learn will

388
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Diton Wheeler is made by Germans

389
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,400
The digital picture drawn by the education plate reconstruction

390
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
but I simply treat it as

391
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,400
You can see that the original hardness lags behind

392
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Then anytime progress hardness ran to the front

393
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
So hard like an Indian cheetah

394
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
the animal that runs as fast as a tough cheetah

395
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Then the Arabic plate

396
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
In fact, they are all glued to this huge flying boat plate.

397
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
So the airship is like a bubbun

398
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
It is lined up from the Southern Continent Pioneer

399
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
but it runs very slowly

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
move slowly north

401
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,300
India's departure time is relatively late

402
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,500
But it's last come first come fast

403
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,000
Run to the north and south and then first load to the edge of Eurasia

404
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,500
So here we build mountains first

405
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
On the contrary, the mountain formation was late

406
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,000
It's more intense here

407
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,300
because india runs fast

408
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,500
So here's the orogenic India

409
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,300
You're doing more than what's being done here

410
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,000
right

411
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,700
This is the case of General

412
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,700
If you push back the history of the earth

413
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,300
longer words

414
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,300
It's just the schematic diagram of that and that.

415
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,800
This is India is Africa

416
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,300
Then India quickly ran up

417
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,800
Africa is connected to the Arabian

418
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,300
run slowly

419
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,600
But this is in the history of the address

420
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,800
One hundred and twenty ninety million years

421
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Then if you push forward

422
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
one hundred and seventy million years

423
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
two hundred and forty million years

424
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,600
three hundred million years three hundred and forty

425
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,800
Until five hundred and forty centuries

426
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,600
Five hundred and forty centuries

427
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,300
Probably the beginning of the cold afternoon season in address history

428
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,800
That is the beginning of the fifth generation

429
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,300
The words before there are

430
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,800
Is it the pre-cold noon season?

431
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
nice to fly

432
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
in a different history

433
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,700
You can see that the combination of the plates will change

434
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,200
there will be one after another

435
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,000
We specially put this picture about 24 million years old for you to see

436
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
The topic I'm going to cover today is about

437
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,700
At this time there was a big ancient ocean

438
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,600
This ancient marine geologist gave him a special name called the Tethys Ocean

439
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,200
English called Tesla Ocean

440
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,300
Chinese translation

441
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Ogain is the translation of the big country called Tethys

442
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,500
Taiwan's translation is called ancient Mediterranean

443
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,800
if you have heard

444
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
But Tethys is actually a very bad translation

445
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,900
because it sounds hard

446
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,700
But Tethysthetis was actually a water god

447
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,100
Or Poseidon is a goddess of female beauty

448
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,400
Translating Tethys can't show it at all

449
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,800
So I secretly translated it into Daixis last time

450
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,400
That sounds like the name of a goddess

451
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,900
At this time, the combination of Tethys Yang looks like this

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Tethys ocean geologists go further

453
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,800
It can be divided into what is called Pilotastic called ancient

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,480
Mesotasis is called Mesotasis

455
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,240
Called New Tedis sheep with Neotasis

456
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,360
So there's a lot of subtle changes in between

457
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,880
Then wait until the Paleozoic to Mesozoic period of this Earth's history

458
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,120
Until the end of the whole evolution of the new generation

459
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,640
Continents from the south make relative applications to the north

460
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Finally close up this teddy sheep

461
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,440
we get what we see today

462
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,160
The so-called error status band

463
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,000
From Tibet, Himalayas, Europa to

464
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,360
Albert in the west, the Perakins, etc.

465
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Proper nouns in cartography

466
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,160
In fact, it should be called Tephanogene belt

467
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,960
It's the Teddis War Belt I mentioned earlier.

468
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,200
It is about taking this ancient Mediterranean

469
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
or after this teddy sheep is closed

470
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,760
continental plates from the south

471
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,760
To the north is mainly the Eurasian continental plate

472
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
when the main things come together

473
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,560
the result of

474
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,760
So my Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing

475
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Wu Furen

476
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,560
It's called they are also working on a joint project

477
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,060
The name of their joint project will be

478
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,560
It's officially called the Tres project

479
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,600
everybody knows

480
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,360
The president's committee and geologists all know

481
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,200
But because my project is in Taiwan

482
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,760
Then interdisciplinary students have to follow physical chemistry

483
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
Mathematics students compete together

484
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,760
So it is necessary to take a comparison

485
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Compare

486
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,200
relatively unpronounceable name

487
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
So it becomes a four-way plan

488
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,760
The Tres plan is a very complicated thing.

489
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
i don't say it in particular

490
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
but must stand

491
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,000
Also very important in geology

492
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The effect of the global global factor

493
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,400
global impact

494
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
not just on the road

495
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,560
You can easily understand on the road

496
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,760
because the board will hit

497
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,960
then there are mountains formed

498
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,360
So the authenticity on the watch is different

499
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,200
when there is such a big plateau

500
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,960
when it melts

501
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Obviously the road will be affected

502
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,400
But the impact isn't just on the road

503
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,760
while in the sea

504
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,640
with the air

505
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,960
Air is the change in the atmosphere

506
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,600
There are also very

507
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
have a serious impact

508
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,920
like in terms of the ocean

509
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Because of the movement of India to Arabia and North

510
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Then the ancient Mediterranean will be specially closed

511
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,200
It turns out that the currents of the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean South

512
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
The currents of the Pacific Ocean are interconnected

513
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,700
Wait until this channel is closed

514
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,000
Wait until Arabia would have crashed into Eurasia

515
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,700
This channel is closed

516
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,000
After closing, you can easily think of

517
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,500
Global ocean currents are greatly affected and will change

518
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,800
So this closing time

519
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,100
Probably in the history of the earth

520
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,000
The 30 million years I mentioned earlier

521
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
about 30 million years

522
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,000
30 million years in the history of the earth

523
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,700
Oligocene is called gradually new type

524
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,500
So when oscillating

525
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,200
In the evolution of earth history

526
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,000
The event with a global cooling

527
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,300
As far as many scholars have begun to discuss

528
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,200
Is it because of this change in ocean currents?

529
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,900
or the closure of this pipe

530
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
Is there any connection with the global goblin cooling?

531
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,000
Many related research associations

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
If changes to the global climate

533
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This is the impact on the air

534
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Effects are not limited to changes on land or on the ground

535
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
In fact, in the ocean

536
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
or atmospheric wind twist

537
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
will have a serious impact

538
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
in these fields

539
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Many related scholars are doing relevant research

540
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Then I will post a few more slides to talk about it

541
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
what is my beijing friend

542
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
no woman ready slide

543
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So it's all simplified characters

544
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So what is a special editor?

545
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The special editor simply said that the earth

546
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
There was an ancient ocean in between

547
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
ancient ocean

548
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
we call

549
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
not us

550
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This is the first person to call him

551
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
is a supplementary student in Austria

552
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Named Tessis in 1893 called Swiss

553
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Tessis is the beautiful lady

554
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Or he is Seafood Oceanus

555
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So it should be translated into a more feminine name

556
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
maybe less obtrusive

557
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So this is the Curtis Ocean in Earth's past history

558
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The southern hemisphere is not between the southern continent and the northern continent

559
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
an ancient ocean that once existed

560
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
In the middle because this ancient ocean is now extinct

561
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So do not keep records that are no longer kept

562
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
or a record kept in the address history

563
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
are incomplete

564
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So there are many, many different arguments or different scholars

565
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
offer different explanations

566
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Like one of the scholars who wrote an article

567
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Specifically to take advantage of the difference in the spelling of Curtis's name

568
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
In fact, there are many, many different debates in it

569
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
How should Curtis be composed?

570
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Then the time of his formation

571
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
where does he exist

572
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
How did he evolve

573
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
have many different interpretations

574
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Or even more naughty is a Turkish geoscientist named Chera Sengo

575
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
His dedicated article discusses

576
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,640
Teddy's story

577
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,440
Then Punchline is

578
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,240
How many wives did oceanists have?

579
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,840
How many wives do oceanists have?

580
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,040
If you want to know a little more about Teddy Yang's story

581
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,240
i always recommend

582
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,840
my student

583
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,440
but you are not my students

584
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,840
then i will talk about shanko

585
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,440
Say a lot to use that wiki site

586
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,680
Wikipedia actually has a lot of related information

587
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,760
So you just hit Testis Ocean

588
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,320
You can find a lot of related information on Wikipedia

589
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,080
Then I'll make this Teddys case tape.

590
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,560
or do this idea

591
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,120
There are so many complex geological problems

592
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,600
of course do everything

593
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,240
Then my reasoning for that research

594
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,840
Like the introduction of Punchline just now

595
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,000
Geochemistry of mainly igneous rocks

596
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,800
So holding hands to two is

597
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,240
The first is geochemical

598
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,800
Geochemistry means

599
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,280
We use chemical knowledge or technology to study

600
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,560
Earth Today or Study Earth's History

601
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,040
So using chemical

602
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,040
Our Tongren Association Academia Sinica at National Taiwan University

603
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,040
There are many sessions dedicated to geophysics

604
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,540
They use their knowledge of physics

605
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,540
or physical techniques to study the earth

606
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,040
eventually modern earth science is hope

607
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,540
All the knowledge and technology at our disposal

608
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Come to study and do modern earth science research

609
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,540
So we claim to be modern geoscientists

610
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,040
I thought the former students were sitting in the back when I said that

611
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,540
Or my students don't quite believe

612
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,980
i am a modern earth

613
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,480
chemist or modern geoscientist

614
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,980
Because I still don't know how to use a mobile phone

615
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,480
because it's geochemistry

616
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,980
The other one is igneous rock

617
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,480
Fire dust rock means

618
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,980
molten rock uses rocks formed in volcanoes or magma

619
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,480
This is my research session

620
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
so in this area

621
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,980
In the history of Alu Collision Stitching

622
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,980
lots of magmatism

623
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,480
Many rock records of igneous rocks have been left

624
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,920
So we're here to study

625
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
This magmatism

626
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,560
leave a record and then study his chronology

627
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,840
when was it formed

628
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,120
study his origins

629
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,660
What are his primitive characteristics?

630
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,940
what kind of stone is it made of

631
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,240
and then study the composition of his geochemistry

632
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,780
and then combine these

633
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,300
What about the records of Yanjiang's homework?

634
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,600
he will tell us something

635
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,360
this

636
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,400
collision history or creation

637
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,720
some records in the process

638
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,800
Then this kind of research needs a basic assumption

639
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,080
The assumption is that

640
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,960
There is a certain relationship between the research and Xinjiang activities and the so-called plate tectonic work

641
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,260
When the plate tectonic environment changes

642
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,400
Yanjiang

643
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,580
If it is produced to research the ingredients of Xinjiang

644
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,380
or his primordial character

645
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,140
will follow

646
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Under different plate tectonic environments before

647
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,260
The composition of a Yanjiang produced is different

648
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,040
for example

649
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,620
The research frontier formed before the collision between India and Asia

650
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,900
India and Asia

651
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,200
Yanjiang formed after the collision

652
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,500
it will have a very different documented nature

653
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,060
We just need to know when he made this change

654
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,800
he'll tell us

655
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,400
how did this collision happen

656
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
what happened in this process

657
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
we look fun

658
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Wait a minute and I'll give you a few examples

659
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
such a hypothesis

660
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
We have done a lot of work in Tibet

661
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Tibet is from an article I published in 2015

662
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The first graph, the first extreme simplification

663
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Address map of Tibet

664
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I tell you this is the time to oversimplify

665
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Everyone smiled incomprehensibly

666
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
or some kind of smile

667
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But this is indeed an extremely simplified address map

668
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I can explain to you well because of this time

669
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Divide the whole Tibet into one, two, three, four, five, six

670
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Seven kinds of stones are posted on this picture

671
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
you really have a chance to see

672
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The address on the Tibetan Plateau

673
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Densely packed with dozens of rocks of different ages

674
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
or stratum

675
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Twice very very tutoring

676
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is an extremely simplified spectrum

677
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,400
Then use such an extremely simplified synthesis

678
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,400
We can then discuss what the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau looks like

679
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,200
If you are interested, please take a look

680
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:23,800
But it is not suitable for me to talk too much about that old stuff

681
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,200
But this article is quite resonant

682
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,800
We spent a lot of time doing this

683
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,200
Published in a geological neutralization period called erscience review

684
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,400
science review has a statistic in 2010

685
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,800
We got a good citation for this article

686
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,400
It is the paper defined by the ranking in all the highly cited papers

687
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,400
So it's still useful to draw some effort

688
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,600
Then do something like this

689
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,000
As I said just now, my research is called

690
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,200
modern digital art learning English is really modern

691
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,240
That is closely related to the development of that instrument and technology.

692
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,440
Let me briefly talk about some kind of technical chemical development

693
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,840
with the technological development of so-called spectrometers

694
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,600
Mass spectrometer is mass spectrometer

695
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,700
Now we technical chemists use many kinds of spectrometers

696
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,040
to do the measurement we want

697
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,000
That way that precise measurement

698
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
We call it prime number

699
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,040
It is mass spectrometry

700
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,340
For example, the element we need

701
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,400
or isotopic measurement

702
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,300
We just try to find a way in the periodic table

703
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,900
find our suitable element or isotope

704
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,900
Then use mass spectrometry to do accurate

705
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,300
or that precise measurement at very low levels

706
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,800
can achieve what we want

707
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,600
The technological development of this kind is about the same as that of the past ten years

708
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:56,000
To some extent, the Department of Geology at National Taiwan University is similar to the so-called

709
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,900
The knowledge plan of 50 billion in five years has a lot to do with it

710
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,000
So 50 billion in five years is actually

711
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,460
Actually did a lot of good things

712
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,300
at least in row

713
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,060
We took this opportunity to set up a couple of really nice labs

714
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,900
In the past few years, I have made a lot of new observations and new bags

715
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:19,560
Including some research results in the thinking plan that I will introduce to you later

716
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,900
The front is all introduction

717
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
To see this, to talk about my thoughts and plans

718
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,700
Since it is an imitation

719
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,900
Youyou Music Ideas Project

720
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:45,200
So I will divide it into about three components to introduce to you

721
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,900
divided into preludes

722
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,500
then enter the topic

723
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,400
then finally to the finale

724
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,900
The prelude will probably be divided into two parts

725
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,100
The topic will be divided into two parts

726
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,100
One is a good place in the Tibetan Himalayas in the east

727
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,100
then one is tibet

728
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,720
To the west are the two regions from the Caucasus to Iran

729
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,640
It is related to a very strange research project in China.

730
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,120
This research project was developed by us 17 or 18 years ago

731
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,280
Starting to leave Taiwan and go to Southeast Asia to do geological science research

732
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,420
A topic I thought up with my feet in my head

733
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,200
So our research project is called CREATE

734
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,040
Tainan Chinese is simply called the East Asian Terran Tectonic Research Integration Project

735
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,200
English name is Comprehensive Research on East Asia Tectonic Evolution

736
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,500
Become a Synchron name called CREATE

737
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,200
We hope this will convince the review committee of the State Council

738
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,400
Give us a little more funding for research

739
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,800
We can go to places outside of Taiwan to work hard and see

740
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:59,800
On the one hand, self-encouragement hopes that we can create some new observations or theories to

741
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,800
This research project is now part of the Ninth Science Division of Congress

742
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,700
It was a very successful plan

743
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,700
Because it has lasted for sixteen seventeen years and has not been terminated

744
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,900
Seventeen years is about three years we have been together

745
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,500
It is now in the sixth period

746
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,600
Three sixty-eight will have a total of eighteen years of planning

747
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,300
Now in middle second year of sixth period

748
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,300
So now I'm doing the research project for the 17th year

749
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,700
Hosley, we can still maintain a certain creativity

750
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:38,700
Do a few more years of related work in the next few years

751
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,500
What about the create research project?

752
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,700
The first place to start is in Southeast Asia

753
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,900
Mount Ai Lao on the Red River in Vietnam

754
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,500
In Vietnam part is actually the Red River

755
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,800
If anyone has ever been to North Vietnam

756
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,700
Going northwest from Hanoi

757
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,500
you will see a big river

758
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,600
That river is the Red River

759
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,100
The Red River is actually a very big break

760
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,760
or fault zone

761
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,600
So the reason why I chose to start solving the problem here

762
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,400
We were originally studying the formation of the South China Sea

763
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
There is a theory about the formation of the South China Sea

764
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,600
It has something to do with the activity of this big fault zone.

765
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,400
Its range is about 1000 kilometers long

766
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,600
is a big fault

767
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,000
lasted 1000 km

768
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,600
So a fault about three times as long as Taiwan

769
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,800
so do it here

770
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,800
It is completely different from the scale in Taiwan.

771
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Why this big break

772
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,200
Or why you want to do research on this large fault zone

773
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,600
It's related to the job of the gentleman I mentioned earlier named Taboneer

774
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,800
Taboneer with some colleagues or students at the University of Paris

775
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,200
Started publishing successive research papers in 1986

776
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
Let's talk about this fault zone

777
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,400
The importance of this fault zone is

778
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,800
They think that after India collided with Asia

779
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
In addition to causing the hearing impairment

780
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,600
The amphibious continental extortion caused by the dragon body on the Tibetan plateau in East Asia

781
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Experiments of the mainland's descent or complementation

782
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,700
like pool

783
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,900
You hit it and two balls go out

784
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,100
Then two boards ran out

785
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,500
After sports hit

786
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,600
The southeast pottery that first formed the Southeast Asian plate

787
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:25,700
Then cause the Tibetan plateau plus the relative motion of eastern Asia to the east

788
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,700
The boundary between the first period and the second period is the Red River Erosendian era

789
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,800
model is very famous

790
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
Until now

791
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,800
in all geology

792
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,500
Textbooks of structural geology have this picture

793
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,200
This is like a model of some kind

794
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,600
or an authoritative explanation

795
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,300
Even because of this work and the NSF in mainland China

796
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,900
Their foundation committee declared that

797
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,800
The problems of this place have been solved by him

798
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,900
So any mainland China study

799
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,100
Apply to study all of the research topics in this place

800
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,540
kill them all

801
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,840
because there is no problem to do

802
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,140
about 15 years ago

803
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,700
When we set off in Taiwan to discuss

804
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,040
We thought this pattern was really beautiful

805
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,840
so beautiful let us think

806
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,640
that word is called

807
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,180
To be true

808
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,220
we just want to try it

809
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,280
The national tiger who was not born with the poison of France

810
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,080
I want to come here to challenge

811
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,860
have a look

812
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,160
Just choose this place to make our first step

813
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,980
Although there are certain risks

814
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,020
feel like playing

815
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,820
may be more enjoyable

816
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,380
When I went to Huashan, I met many

817
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,940
Study on the Ho Chi Minh Trail

818
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,460
not so easy

819
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,780
That's a small thing except the cable car

820
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,560
but we

821
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,120
good luck

822
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,180
found in the previous 12 years

823
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,480
Several very important geological roads

824
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,520
then quickly do some

825
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,060
analyze

826
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,900
In 1997 and 1998 respectively in

827
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,640
The mainstream period of the Georgia Society of America

828
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,520
Called Georgia published two papers on the Red River Alasan fault zone

829
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,620
That view is completely different from that of the French gang.

830
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,180
So there was an uproar

831
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,780
From then on, the French hated the things that Tuantuan made very much.

832
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,880
The incomprehensible resources we have forged with him have continued to this day

833
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
I always tell people that this is an incomprehensible fate

834
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,280
Tarponia still hates our team so much

835
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,080
because some of the things we published

836
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,400
I think there are many in the model that he was very beautiful at the time

837
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,200
The problem with Fundamental

838
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,040
In fact, it should be the wrong foothold.

839
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,620
So until now I'm still fighting

840
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:53,760
But for me personally, the research on the Red River Alashan fault zone is more important

841
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,560
Track to the northwest by tracking the Red River Alashan

842
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,100
This is where the Red River Alashan breaks

843
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
In the end we climbed up the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

844
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So I went to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and made some things

845
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Also sent a paper that looks good

846
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But more importantly, after this prelude

847
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
One of the topics we can remember to cover today

848
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It is the create project and Tibet research

849
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That went to the infinite of this world

850
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It's easy to think of words of encouragement

851
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Quickly copy a sentence out

852
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Everyone felt inspired and went to Tibet

853
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Up Zufan

854
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So I like to use this composite picture to say that so many people went

855
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The people in the colorful photos are our working team

856
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Except this black and white

857
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That's the other picture you saw on the poster

858
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
This was when I was in Tibet about ten years ago

859
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
My graduate student at that time helped me take the photo

860
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Intentionally shot in black and white

861
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It looks particularly memorable now

862
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Looks like the one from Fuji

863
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The young man with a big bag on his back went to Tibet to learn Buddhist scriptures

864
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
explore that

865
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
is the secret of an address

866
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,500
When the boss was chatting

867
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,000
He's 84 and it's been 10 years

868
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,500
Now if he is still there

869
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,000
hope he's still there

870
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,500
and in good

871
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
is 94 years old

872
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,500
He looked very, very healthy at the time

873
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,000
their next world

874
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
this one

875
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It was only after the whole set was given to me that I found out

876
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
In fact, that Bradbitt has been working on that private road project for a long time.

877
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
run far ahead of me

878
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Brad Beatt acted in a Hollywood movie when he was young

879
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Called 7 Years in Tibet

880
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Many people may have seen

881
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's about a late World War II

882
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
The story of an Austrian mountaineer named Hirish Barrow

883
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Last time I was stuck in my heart for 7 years

884
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And also met Dalai Nana

885
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Dalai Nana's childhood story

886
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
If you haven't seen it, go and have a look

887
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Why do you say he is already working on a private road project?

888
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You'll be fucking Brad Pitt later

889
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,100
we didn't get a chance to see dallala

890
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,300
But we have seen many interesting geological phenomena in the plateau mountains

891
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,700
Also see a lot

892
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,100
A few photos I'm going to show you right now

893
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,200
distant hometown

894
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,400
There are many Tibetan girls

895
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,700
There are also different costumes for people from different regions

896
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,400
But they are all equally curious

897
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,600
There are Tibetan compatriots

898
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,000
then use this opportunity

899
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,900
Thank you to the other two of our three cobblers

900
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,600
We have been doing this create project from the very beginning until now

901
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,800
One is my colleague Professor Luo Qinghua from National Taiwan University

902
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,300
The other is Professor Li Tongyi from STU

903
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,400
They are on the plateau, they are suffering from this altitude sickness headache

904
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,100
Still willing to be my support until now

905
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,500
So take this time to show you

906
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:51,300
The one from Game of three

907
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,600
Then if you go to Tibet

908
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,800
Working hours in Tibet are mainly in summer

909
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,200
There is no way to work in winter

910
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,500
We can only enter the venue when we are in our appointment

911
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's okay if you don't go out

912
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Then I can't work again in July and August

913
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Because July and August is the rainy season

914
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You see, when it rains in Tibet, it is very troublesome

915
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
september october is a good time to work

916
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
then november

917
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
it's going to snow in november

918
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But even when working in the summer

919
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Still easy to see like this

920
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
look

921
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
especially to northern Tibet

922
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
As long as there is a brook coming down, this is the virtue

923
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
So high-level hospitals should not have been to Tibet

924
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
otherwise

925
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
August Snow may be able to write a little easier

926
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The field is especially beautiful when it snows

927
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
like this one is tibetan steel thirteen

928
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Thirteen is a mountain range mainly composed of granite

929
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
mountains of granite

930
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
When it snows, we call it Yiyiyi

931
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
you can take pictures like this

932
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
But it's snowing and I still have to work

933
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Because there is not much time in a year to go

934
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
The advantage of being a teacher is that

935
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
You don't have to tell the students to go over by yourself

936
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Then work hard during the semester

937
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
young people are different

938
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
There are also high priority sheep in the blood particles

939
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
like this

940
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
High atomic treasure is this guy

941
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
In short there are curious furry cows that touch near us

942
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Then their Zibao future products

943
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Often used on the wall

944
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
This is the most successful photo I took on the letter

945
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Just made a fool of myself

946
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So it's not a question of camera skills

947
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's a question of good scenery

948
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So it was used as a poster

949
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
a big lake in the south of tibet

950
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Yang Zhuoyongcuo

951
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
very beautiful lake

952
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So if you have the opportunity to go to Tibet

953
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Don't forget to go to Yang Zhuo Yong wrong

954
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But there will be altitude sickness

955
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
so you have to be mentally prepared

956
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
But in fact, my body is fine.

957
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
so you should be fine

958
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
that such a Tibet

959
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
In fact, a serious problem was discovered immediately

960
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
very serious problem is

961
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,440
because this is the substance of the world

962
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,600
Research work since the 1990s or early 2000s

963
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,400
After being hit easily

964
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,160
The problem of the highland dragon

965
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,960
Or its Global Impact problem

966
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,600
Therefore, the problems that everyone is doing are mainly on the initiative.

967
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,200
After India collided with Asia

968
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,360
Problems with Tibetan plateau or whole size biomass

969
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,100
How did the dragon come into being?

970
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,200
then how does it change

971
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,300
When you do your research you find out

972
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,600
Each section is beautifully modeled

973
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,900
all on a very loose pile of sand

974
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,500
A very loose pile of sand is

975
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,600
Boundary Conditions Before India's Collision With Asia

976
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,600
very very little data

977
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,700
Everyone has done a very little information above

978
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,200
Start developing its very nice model

979
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
so we feel

980
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,900
Maybe someone should do a little guesswork

981
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,800
We chose this material to make

982
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,300
The structure of the plate or extended circle before the collision

983
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,200
this matter

984
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,100
That is, all collision models

985
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,840
In fact, the boundary conditions

986
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,240
to study this thing

987
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,140
This is the red stone

988
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,300
What we just said here is called steel bottom silk mountain

989
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,200
Or we call it steel bottom wire rock mass

990
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,440
or more broadly

991
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:16,000
I call this thing the Antis Mountain of South Asia

992
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,740
How did Mount Antis of South Asia come about?

993
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,640
you just thought

994
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,000
Antis Hill I just introduced

995
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,840
Enrichment-type impact scars

996
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,600
Enlarged type of impact marks, right?

997
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,640
Is the Pacific plate like Dongying or Huchong

998
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,400
to the continental plate of South America

999
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,800
out of the mountain

1000
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
That mountain is actually mainly

1001
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,400
As a human being, I will study the volcanic eruption itinerary of human beings

1002
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,100
if you have been to south america

1003
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,700
you know the main mountain

1004
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,600
Each one is a big volcano

1005
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,000
same situation in this place

1006
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,200
If you pull that India out

1007
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,500
pull back

1008
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,300
after pulling away

1009
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,000
There is an ancient ocean that will come out

1010
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,300
That ocean is the Tethys Ocean I just mentioned.

1011
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,000
Tethys oceanic plate

1012
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,600
So the oceanic plate is heading north

1013
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,700
Hidden sprawl went under the continental plate of South Asia

1014
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,200
so before the collision

1015
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,300
the one with the one that creeps northwards

1016
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Then built a rocky Andes on the edge of South Asia

1017
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Just before India collided

1018
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Here is a long-lived Saimai

1019
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
like what we saw in the andes today

1020
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
But this South Asian Andes

1021
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
very low level of research

1022
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
to its time to the process of its formation

1023
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
what happened to the rock that caused it

1024
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
There is only very, very little information

1025
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So when we went to Tibet in 2000

1026
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I decided to make some of this bitter dish

1027
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It starts from Gangdi Shishan here

1028
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I like to do Side with that quote from my friend

1029
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This is my good friend and my bad friend

1030
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
because he always bothers me

1031
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
That professor at Oxford University is called Mike Sear

1032
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's the great expert in the Himalayas

1033
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Working in the Himalayas for 30 years

1034
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
is oxford university

1035
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
He just posted it earlier this year

1036
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
A science book called The Colliding Continents

1037
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
don't come here often

1038
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Go in and encourage you to buy a copy and take a look

1039
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
my name is mentioned in the middle

1040
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
but i like racing a word in it

1041
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
i just said

1042
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
In fact, one word is to say

1043
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The first world is the fourth dimension

1044
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
The fourth dimension is time

1045
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
is empty

1046
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
its a university study

1047
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and most importantly

1048
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
it understands everything in the world

1049
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
this is a saying

1050
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
it can no longer be explained

1051
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So when studying address evolution or address events

1052
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
very important thing

1053
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
the past ten years

1054
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Luckily there is a new dating method

1055
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's not really new

1056
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
A dating method was developed by the meal

1057
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
There is a strange mineral in the time-lapse

1058
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
This mineral is abundant

1059
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
but useful

1060
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
This mineral is called telling the truth

1061
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
English called Zircon

1062
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It's that one of those sour speeches

1063
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,420
Its chemical formula is VR-SIO4

1064
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,100
So is the Zoccom Decidicates

1065
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,160
That mineral is very tenacious

1066
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,460
it's after the bathroom

1067
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,120
it will grab a certain amount

1068
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,960
then use it for a while to hold it will protect it

1069
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
don't let it go

1070
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,460
Then use a very important placement element

1071
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,460
Because it will go through Chanticare and finally become NProduct

1072
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:20,760
will become Chan

1073
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,000
So with this placement system it's fine

1074
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,300
Dating tool or make a nice Geo-Cronometer

1075
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,760
Then in addition to the age that the 6000 system can give

1076
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,420
tell the truth because it's tall

1077
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,060
So the other relative I sued is H

1078
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,720
This element can be used for original measurement

1079
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,020
will make very accurate measurements

1080
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,220
So that gives you the composition of the Ha isotope

1081
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,420
So this mineral can give you age at the same time

1082
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,900
At the same time give you another isotope system

1083
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,920
Can be used as a so-called Isotropic Tracer

1084
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,620
can tell you what the source that said it was made of

1085
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,280
So that over the past 10 years

1086
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,020
become an important one

1087
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,160
a fixed method

1088
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,520
But why was it rarely used in the past?

1089
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,040
mainly because it's small

1090
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,640
When each Boss grows in this master

1091
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,800
Often grow into such a thin and long look

1092
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,440
it will be around the waist

1093
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,280
About 50 microns to 100 microns

1094
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,920
Micron is Uyghurni here

1095
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,320
10-6 anti-meter

1096
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,440
So the right eye can't actually see

1097
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,960
To be seen under a highly magnified microscope

1098
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,600
The length is usually one or two hundred micron

1099
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,120
Therefore, it was difficult to do precise measurement with the previous technology.

1100
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,680
But because of laser technology

1101
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,600
is applied to this field of geochemistry

1102
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,400
very successful over the past ten years

1103
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,920
So put the laser laser system

1104
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,000
Plus that jeep technology

1105
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,320
The technology we commonly use now is called laser ICBMS

1106
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,800
You can do it very precisely in this small notice

1107
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,000
its right shoulder

1108
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,440
get its right shoulder parity

1109
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,480
It is possible to calculate the age of its formation

1110
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,760
can measure what's in it

1111
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,920
The composition of Ha isodigits

1112
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,400
This mineral now becomes

1113
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,680
very useful thing

1114
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,940
Because our private program

1115
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,100
A lot of factual analysis was done

1116
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,900
The borrowed geologist changed a word

1117
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,900
This is actually a word in Deville

1118
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,900
Deville is a temporary company

1119
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,900
Temporary company's original advertisement called

1120
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,400
Diamond is the best friend of women

1121
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,100
So the geologists changed it to say

1122
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,900
Zerchrom is the best friend of geologists

1123
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,600
I give a practical example

1124
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,800
because my former student

1125
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,500
Dr. Meifei Zhu

1126
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,200
sit there

1127
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,700
So it's his job to do a little bit with everyone

1128
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,200
a little more introduction

1129
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Made by Zhu Meifei

1130
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,700
Inside the Primarch Gambis in the south of Tibet

1131
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,800
Score some tell the truth

1132
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,200
This truth sometimes grows a little blunt

1133
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,700
Some are slimmer

1134
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,100
This is 50micron scale

1135
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,100
So this is about 100micron crown

1136
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,700
This is about 6 or 70 micron crowns

1137
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,900
In such a small truth

1138
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,100
We can use laser ICPMS technology

1139
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,300
It's in the contact with National Taiwan University

1140
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,100
our laboratory

1141
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,440
This is a Laser System

1142
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,140
Behind this is a small ICM-MS

1143
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:09,740
Spectrum of Inductive Couple and Plasma

1144
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,840
very long Chinese translation

1145
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,040
put it together

1146
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,640
Small notices can be made with Laser

1147
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,240
Laser Beam probably can

1148
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,760
Make a Micron

1149
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,240
Fraction typed out

1150
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,640
And send Kalor Gas to Zhipu

1151
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,680
To analyze its right-shifted system Wei Subizi

1152
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,680
To analyze its Hartung-Western Bizi

1153
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,740
So like this ZQC Grant

1154
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,280
can play three holes

1155
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,780
High time for three shots

1156
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,980
different ages available

1157
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,680
and the different Ha Tung Wei Suzi

1158
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,680
this shot twice

1159
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,740
Its Core took a shot

1160
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,080
It's Room a shot

1161
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,380
get different ages

1162
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,140
Obtaining a different metric ratio

1163
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,980
Finally, the result of our analysis is

1164
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,080
XQC is from India

1165
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,120
The Room it grows from is local in Asia

1166
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It grows in the south of Tibet

1167
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So the implication is this telling

1168
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
It was inside a stone

1169
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
it is from the indian plate

1170
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Because India is warm and Asian wind is in Hong Kong

1171
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
sent to the crust of the Asian continent

1172
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Then in this tell the side length

1173
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
one more ring

1174
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It is the ring belt grown from the nutrients in Asia

1175
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So there is the Indian Core

1176
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Then add Rhoome from the Asian continent

1177
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
grow like today

1178
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So the title of this final part is

1179
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
India's Hidden Input to Tibetan

1180
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Originary Review by

1181
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Haffnima Stubbler

1182
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Transit in my life in circumstance

1183
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or Strax that middle detail

1184
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I won't talk about it in particular

1185
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Such an application is actually

1186
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
We can use such a small particle to tell

1187
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's actually a micro scale thing

1188
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
then after such a small

1189
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Analysis of the original flavor of the cross-thing

1190
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
we can discuss

1191
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Juguan Megascale

1192
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
or the whole plot

1193
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Danish or Highland Evolution

1194
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
the one like this

1195
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Ban Guo Zao's question

1196
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Therefore, the ancients said that the tool of health

1197
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We think there is actually a certain truth in it.

1198
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
We use such a technique

1199
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Did it on Tibet for the past few years

1200
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
quite a bit of that work

1201
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
An example of this is

1202
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
eyeballs like this one or yellow eyeballs

1203
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
or brown eyes

1204
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
It's what I just said

1205
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
the one from south asia

1206
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Dark Thirteen Above

1207
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
the stone out of the ground

1208
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So we go along this south side of Tibet

1209
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
do the detailed one

1210
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
no way to detail

1211
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Do more detailed field work

1212
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
then sample

1213
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Then tell the truth

1214
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
followed by petrology

1215
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
work with geochemistry

1216
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
from the south

1217
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
The reference listed here

1218
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's me who supervises some graduate students at National Taiwan University

1219
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Coupled with the cooperation with the Beijing Academy of Chinese Sciences

1220
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
or co-advised graduate students

1221
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
a series of work done

1222
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Actually there are more

1223
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Tracking from the south of Tibet to the southeast

1224
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Then the one in South Asia

1225
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Dark Thirteen can actually be tracked further south

1226
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
West of Mingnan

1227
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,240
then into Burma

1228
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,760
So I'm now a postdoctoral researcher

1229
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,240
PhD researcher who works with me

1230
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,000
You know he is now

1231
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,360
This is the way to track southeast

1232
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,040
Work in Myanmar

1233
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:14,800
After arriving in Myanmar

1234
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,200
You'll be able to do advanced traffic

1235
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,000
go on some field trips

1236
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,600
then take the time

1237
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,680
Come back to work in the lab

1238
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,520
A South Asian Andy Thirteen

1239
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,440
or we say

1240
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,120
Mianyan is more than 3000 kilometers along the river and lake

1241
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,560
Cotton rock cheap rose to

1242
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,320
South China Sea

1243
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,640
On top of Sumatra in Indonesia

1244
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,160
Can

1245
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,760
we have now

1246
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,040
work has spread to

1247
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,040
Sumatra went up

1248
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,200
Then it looks like the lake of Andy Thirteen

1249
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,880
From South Asia actually across the Pamirs

1250
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,280
further west into iran

1251
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,760
or the range where the elevated

1252
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,600
I'll take a moment to introduce you

1253
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,960
Students can make a face-to-face discussion

1254
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
How did the address of Tibet evolve?

1255
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Like this article, a north-south instant noodle is drawn

1256
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
The north-south instant noodles are probably this place

1257
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Draw a north-south instant noodle

1258
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Say from India to the interior of Tibet

1259
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
or how the interior of Asia might change

1260
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
from 65 million years ago

1261
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
There is the time when the new generation begins

1262
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Then it gradually changed to what it is today

1263
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Tibet draws a north-south instant noodle

1264
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It's the south, it's the north

1265
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So this side is India and this side is Asia

1266
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
we guess or we speculate

1267
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Or we propose a model that says

1268
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
it should look like this

1269
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
First two plates collide

1270
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Then there is a green plate in front called

1271
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Ocean Plate of Tethyslan

1272
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Ocean Plate of Tethyslan

1273
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
One action is that it has to be detached first

1274
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
stripped off

1275
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Because after the two road-grabbing plates collided,

1276
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
This heavier oceanic plate

1277
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
will fall off

1278
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,500
Like a drag gong called a Slap Breakup

1279
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,500
The road and Asia began to collide violently

1280
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,640
after a violent collision

1281
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,600
Asia's plate is relatively soft

1282
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,400
The Indian plate is colder and harder

1283
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,800
So it will cause the Asian board to drill the board

1284
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,760
Then it became like this

1285
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,960
stubborn

1286
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,600
Because of the balance of gravity

1287
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,760
Then something sinks under the Asian plate

1288
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,800
drag the gong and sink

1289
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,000
This action we call

1290
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,160
Root Foundering

1291
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,480
The Chinese translation seems to be called to follow

1292
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,520
or split function

1293
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,560
So we think that during the formation of Tibet

1294
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,360
Breakup with a special thought section

1295
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,720
Then there is a thickened asian plate

1296
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,480
The role of the dismantling of the Asian plate

1297
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,880
In the end it became what it is today

1298
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,960
Of course, there is no way to talk about the process of the department in detail.

1299
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,560
That

1300
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,480
When the actual Breakup happened

1301
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,080
Probably in the address history

1302
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,600
fifty million years ago

1303
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,600
Fifty MA occurred at that time

1304
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,400
because how do we know

1305
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,000
Because we found a lot of records of magma activity on it

1306
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,140
So using these records of magmatic activity

1307
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,700
And come out sticky controls are all this time

1308
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,600
So draw a picture of instant noodles at that time

1309
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,200
The detailed diagram is probably at this level

1310
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,940
At that time, the upper and lower plates or the earth's crust are sucked

1311
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,840
or the lithosphere is not thick

1312
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,100
relatively thin

1313
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,300
So there's an asthenosphere of convection coming up

1314
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,640
That sounds too professional

1315
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,800
But the so-called time when

1316
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,100
It causes the geochemistry of magmatism

1317
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,800
will also change with

1318
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,100
For example, the 50 million years just mentioned

1319
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:42,500
Fifty million years of this virtue

1320
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
But we can draw a noodle diagram

1321
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,000
because we're using the time stamp as a guide

1322
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That's sixty million years

1323
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,800
fifty million years

1324
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,000
forty million years

1325
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,200
thirty million years

1326
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,800
we are south of west

1327
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,000
Specimens dating back 60 million years can be collected

1328
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,200
50 million year old specimen

1329
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,900
40 million year old specimen

1330
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,000
That picture is right

1331
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,120
There is a detailed earth year for the geochemical analysis to see

1332
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,200
Since 50 million years

1333
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,000
The nature of the created igneous rocks or magmatic activities is different.

1334
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,360
It has different Lensinum etubium

1335
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,000
The Racial change

1336
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,800
There are different C variations for these two elements

1337
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,800
This has a change that tells us that

1338
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,920
The chemistry of the magma that formed was different

1339
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,200
My earlier narration said

1340
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,720
Magma chemistry reflects differences in plate tectonic environments

1341
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,320
right

1342
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:35,120
The Bagel knowledge of some research and geochemistry told us that

1343
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,880
The chemistry that produces this ingredient in this way

1344
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,320
The chemical nature of the magma is a signal that the crust is beginning to thicken

1345
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,280
That is, since 50 million years ago

1346
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,920
The crust in the south of Tibet began to gradually thicken

1347
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,520
So the pen quality of the element in the magma it creates

1348
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,480
or its protogeochemical signature

1349
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,880
will follow the magma from 50 million years ago

1350
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,840
are different

1351
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,840
May I

1352
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,340
So if we go back to this cartoon

1353
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,340
just tell us

1354
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,300
India and Asia collide

1355
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,140
hit hard

1356
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,600
this is cold and hard

1357
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,400
also hardness plate

1358
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,200
This is relatively warm and soft

1359
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,540
The Asian plate begins to thicken

1360
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,500
So this one looks thin

1361
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,700
This Asian plate is gradually thickening

1362
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,340
thickened to what it is today

1363
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,140
today's appearance

1364
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,900
Why are we talking about crust thickening?

1365
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,840
because under Tibet

1366
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:29,600
There is currently the last continental crust on Earth

1367
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,300
if you remember

1368
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,000
My classmates in high school may all remember it clearly

1369
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,200
earth science textbook

1370
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,800
I told us that the average thickness of the continental crust is

1371
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,700
40 kilometers, right?

1372
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,400
The thickness of the crust below Tibet is

1373
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,800
Average to twice the thickness of the Earth's crust

1374
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,700
after it reaches 80 kilometers

1375
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,500
So all geological issues in Tibet

1376
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,300
or anyone who constructs evolutionary problems must explain

1377
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,500
why it can thicken up to 80 km

1378
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,000
What we know from the geochemical evidence

1379
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,500
50 eight years later

1380
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,000
On cue that he started Dico started thickening

1381
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
So this thickening time is

1382
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
After a lot, you can go all the way to today's 70 to 80 kilometers

1383
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
There will be a special research area when the first section is thickened

1384
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
This particular research has a special jargon

1385
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
called aedakites

1386
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Chinese called aedakite

1387
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
When we were in 2003

1388
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
First found in the south of Tibet

1389
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
The special research boundary melted by this thickened crust

1390
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
made a report

1391
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
aedakite that thing

1392
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
such a report

1393
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Later in that geotubes it was quoted that

1394
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
This is a very important new discovery in research and inspection

1395
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
new discovery

1396
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So I got this from that wikipedia

1397
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
the thing that leaked

1398
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Emphasis on aedakite

1399
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,580
Inside that photo bag where continents collided

1400
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,040
Thin barriers can appear

1401
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,240
The cited reference is 4

1402
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:07,000
This is our article

1403
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:07,640
when i was in class

1404
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,280
often take this thing out

1405
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,480
Take it out and show it to the students

1406
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,040
Then do a little more introduction

1407
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,440
It was a study class at that time

1408
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,880
can be more detailed

1409
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,080
But if you are naughty, just say

1410
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,680
Can Wikipedia be edited by yourself?

1411
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:24,200
So he said the teacher is filled in by yourself

1412
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,680
I really didn't fill it in

1413
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,880
You are welcome to go up and have a look

1414
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,080
If you remember Adkite

1415
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,080
but

1416
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:34,080
Please don't delete this one on purpose

1417
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,680
The journal is called Geology

1418
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,880
I just said that the American Area Society

1419
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,880
Special journals have made special statistics

1420
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,880
past eleven or eleven years

1421
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,480
The so-called highly sighted paper

1422
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,880
We have exactly two articles including that one

1423
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,480
The other one was made by teacher Zhu Meiwei just now

1424
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,080
What's in a doctoral dissertation

1425
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,480
two in

1426
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,880
Inside of the top three reference names for each year

1427
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,500
So in this big pie chart

1428
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,700
Taiwan is squeezed into this small, very small gorge

1429
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,400
this is bragging

1430
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,400
so try not to talk

1431
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,100
In addition to studying the South Asian Andy Thirteen

1432
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,200
Since you have done so much telling the truth

1433
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,500
telltale work can

1434
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,100
In fact, it is helping us to do another

1435
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,800
Things related to the research and development of South Asian terrane structure

1436
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,100
It's the one here who rises from the mountain

1437
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,500
With the climate of this Southeast Asia

1438
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,100
and even the development of the river system

1439
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,400
have a very close relationship

1440
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,700
It is the development map of today's water system

1441
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:34,600
But in the past in the history of Earth Day

1442
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,900
In this case, before the Indian collision

1443
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,300
Isn't there an ancient ocean ahead?

1444
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,300
That ancient ocean is called special breeding

1445
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,100
So before India collided

1446
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,200
I believe there are many rivers here

1447
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,900
Actually it's not east

1448
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,900
Instead, it flows westward into this ancient Mediterranean

1449
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,400
Or specially kept inside

1450
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,700
It is because of this collision that the ocean

1451
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,200
This ancient ocean is closed

1452
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,300
Then the terrain rises

1453
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,800
So all new rivers go east

1454
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,500
or flow southeast

1455
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,020
So there is a topic to study that

1456
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:09,520
The collision process from no collision to the beginning of the collision to the current situation

1457
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,400
How did the major water systems and major rivers in Southeast Asia develop?

1458
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:18,100
This can be done as a so-called South to think

1459
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,700
The environment from the original to the grade is called South

1460
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,400
Related research from the original meeting

1461
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,500
Because of the dissolution of the plateau, it is in the off sea of â€‹â€‹Southeast Asia

1462
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,100
Now there are so many young Chen Jiwu

1463
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,600
The young Chen Jiwu has a lot of facts to do related research work

1464
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,500
The truth in this Chen Jiwu or the truth from the time of marriage

1465
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,700
There is a proper term called Detrital Zochron

1466
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,100
Chinese is called the truth of debris

1467
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,500
It's the confessions from the time of the relatives

1468
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,900
So we can go and study the age of the detritus' truth

1469
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:49,600
Analyze its age, analyze its Hartung number

1470
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,800
and trace its source

1471
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:56,000
Let's discuss the process of the river's pro-time transportation and accumulation

1472
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,700
Right on the plateau we can study the stones on the plateau

1473
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,400
So struck

1474
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,900
after that

1475
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,300
The main river will be developed under the plateau

1476
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,340
grab the sand inside

1477
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,860
Go study the debris notice inside

1478
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,740
Then the mountain can be compared with the mountain

1479
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:11,240
Can see a lot of things that others can't see

1480
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,300
or something that no one has seen before

1481
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,240
In the materials I gave you again, an oiler said

1482
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,600
A few grains of notice to make mountains

1483
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,400
It's about this story

1484
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,140
At that time, this one had very long hair

1485
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,360
very elegant graduate student

1486
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,320
Wearing a very red and very bright coat on Tibet

1487
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,620
This is Yalu Tibetan wood pulp

1488
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:35,120
Then ask his seniors and sisters to help him collect specimens

1489
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,660
I picked some sand and came back

1490
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,060
Then analyze the debris notice inside

1491
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:40,660
Then find a way to use

1492
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:43,420
For that boundless imagination

1493
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,320
What kind of connections are there in the middle?

1494
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,960
There's a lot of fun in there

1495
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,520
But I can't tell you carefully

1496
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,660
in order to track down this thing

1497
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,720
So we ran down the hill

1498
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,820
good

1499
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,020
good

1500
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,380
India can't go to India

1501
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,020
So only with Indians India

1502
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
while collaborating on this

1503
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
The lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangmu River are called

1504
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
brahmaputra r.

1505
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
if you remember to do

1506
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I couldn't remember it at first

1507
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
English is called Bama Putra

1508
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Bama Putra is this

1509
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
one of the most important rivers in this place

1510
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Then go east and enter the Irrawaddy River

1511
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Then go east and enter into

1512
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
A series of Southeast Asian personnel that river

1513
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
This is what our work looks like in the Irrawaddy

1514
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
none of the jobs

1515
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It was this girl who knocked the stone hard

1516
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Then in the Irrawaddy River to pick

1517
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
sand

1518
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Finally we now build

1519
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
good that data base

1520
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Along this South Asia's Mount Iss

1521
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
we picked a lot of that

1522
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
the hard rock from the middle

1523
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
analyze the age of its telltale stone

1524
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
with the host

1525
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
The one that also analyzes rocks

1526
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Geochemistry Moderator

1527
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
then follow this river

1528
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
major river system

1529
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Then next to the water system of the water system

1530
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
The sand or the bottom that deposits locally inside

1531
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Mined a lot of cave stones

1532
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,300
I hope that the research on the mountain and the mountain can be coordinated

1533
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,900
Look up and down or research this from Softs to Think

1534
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:11,300
Zhaoshantai is deep and the one received by Boshi at the bottom of the mountain

1535
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,100
that thing that was recorded

1536
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,700
This is my first grad student to tell the truth

1537
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,800
Xiao Tang's work team of graduate students who just graduated this summer

1538
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,100
Myanmar made some fun stuff

1539
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,700
but i can't go on

1540
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,000
Because I'm going to go into Topic 2

1541
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,100
Otherwise I take up too much time

1542
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,200
The second theme is after we have done some work here

1543
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,500
I think we should go west to do some comparative work

1544
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,500
The most important reason why contrast works is that

1545
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,400
As I said earlier this is a mature crash photo seatbelt

1546
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,000
It started to collide about 60 million years ago

1547
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,500
Mature banging takes big tits

1548
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,800
there is a lot to study

1549
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,100
But it has a very important disadvantage

1550
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,100
The downside is the record early in the collision

1551
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,900
Overshadowed by later or later records

1552
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,200
or was destroyed

1553
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,000
so many steps

1554
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,600
Because I can't find it here or I can't see it completely

1555
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,400
We just want to find the west sky

1556
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,660
This is a younger, more initial collision state

1557
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:12,200
In that place we can find records of the early days of the continental continental collision

1558
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,000
Finally, I hope to combine the states of these two different periods together.

1559
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,500
we'll have a chance to see the collision state start

1560
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:21,500
and then until the evolution to the mature stage

1561
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,800
It was a very simple idea when designing this time

1562
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,700
After doing it for a few years now, I realize that's not the case at all.

1563
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,000
But I can't tell you the details

1564
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,600
I still have to tell you

1565
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,600
Our logic is designed like this

1566
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,100
And then funded by Congress's court program

1567
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,600
It's a good thing that teacher Lu Luoquan didn't come today.

1568
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,100
Otherwise he might condemn me

1569
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:44,600
What I want to do is these two mountains or these two large plateaus

1570
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,800
can we do one thing

1571
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,700
It is to use a story to describe the evolution of these two industries

1572
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:52,000
The Tibetan Plateau next to this system

1573
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,400
The country over there is called the CIA Plateau

1574
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:58,700
It's Gao Jiasuo plus Iran plus Anatolia

1575
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,100
He is called CIA by name

1576
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Koken

1577
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
People can write Shuang Cheng Ji

1578
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
A Tale of Two Cities

1579
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
we might be able to

1580
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I have a pattern called A Tale of Two Pathos

1581
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
to this place

1582
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
can think of something right now

1583
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
something to do with history

1584
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
in fact

1585
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Many concepts related to Greek mythology

1586
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
There are many stories in it

1587
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
words like here

1588
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Immediately thought of Persia

1589
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Because from Iran to Anatolia

1590
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
They are actually of the Persian race.

1591
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Then this picture is for you to see

1592
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Map of Alexander the Great

1593
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
if you remember

1594
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
the words of that hollywood movie a few years ago

1595
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
so here we go

1596
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
to iran

1597
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Immediately see a lot of Persian architecture

1598
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Tehran is the capital of Iran

1599
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Tehran is a very ugly city

1600
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Then it is very discouraged to go

1601
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
but tehran has one

1602
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
iran has one

1603
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
The current second largest city is Isfahan

1604
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
in the south

1605
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Isfahan is a very important

1606
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The ancient city of Persia

1607
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,020
Then the Iranians themselves said

1608
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:04,800
istan represents half of the world

1609
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,760
Half of the world

1610
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,600
There are many places worth visiting in the middle

1611
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,480
Then this is taken from the webpage in Ma Youyou's private plan

1612
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,000
So if you want to broadcast something about Persia

1613
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,920
other than music

1614
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,520
In fact, on the webpage of Ma Youyou's private plan

1615
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,800
There are many beautiful photos

1616
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,160
Professional-grade photos we can't get

1617
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,240
when you go to iran

1618
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,640
Immediately encountered a lot of different things

1619
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,440
This photo is on the poster

1620
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,040
You'll see reports on CNN or BDC

1621
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,040
something very different

1622
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,080
There are very, very friendly fellow villagers

1623
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:44,240
very kind people

1624
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,640
have very blue sky

1625
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,560
There is very sour oil that is not very tasty

1626
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,520
and then there's korankin, which is everywhere

1627
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,240
And then you'll often run into some desert climate stuff

1628
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,240
so there is a hot sun

1629
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:00,240
But these when you have good geological phenomena can be seen

1630
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:00,920
it doesn't matter

1631
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,620
I have many photos of Iran

1632
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,120
But I can't show you one by one

1633
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,420
If you push further west in Iran

1634
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,420
Arrived at the viaduct

1635
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,620
This is the scenery of Daejiao Suo Mountain in spring

1636
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,420
very different from iran

1637
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:13,460
above iran you see

1638
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,220
mostly desert climate stuff

1639
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:16,200
then you get to the elevated

1640
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,820
you see a lot of green things

1641
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:24,220
The elevated mountain has something to do with Greek mythology

1642
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,060
Because there is a prome

1643
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,100
Hughes fell here

1644
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:32,360
Prometheus is the movie from last year to the year before

1645
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,260
I'm very interested

1646
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:35,220
Because of the relationship with the elevated

1647
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:38,820
The giant who was punished by Kanari

1648
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:41,520
The giant hand hangs on a cliff at the Great Elevated Station

1649
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,500
The liver that accepts Lao Yin to eat him day after day

1650
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,720
leaver

1651
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:47,420
Is such that

1652
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,100
So when I went to the elevated station

1653
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,660
just try hard to find the cliff

1654
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,660
Check for Prometheus

1655
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,060
see a lot of beautiful scenery

1656
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,820
But without Prometheus

1657
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,980
But there are many beauties in elevated places

1658
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,600
But not always so lucky

1659
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,600
Like this aluminum one seems to like my look better

1660
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,100
Then push to the west and go quickly.

1661
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,100
because my business should be coming soon

1662
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,000
to TÃ¼rkiye

1663
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,500
TÃ¼rkiye has so many things to mention

1664
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:15,700
except address

1665
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,100
But I can only give you three examples

1666
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,700
show you this

1667
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:22,300
Servo project by Red Pit

1668
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,400
he ran to that from the west

1669
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,000
Inside the Troy Coming Movie

1670
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,500
The god of war who played the legend

1671
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,600
Akievez's movie

1672
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,900
watched several times

1673
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,600
but what about the story

1674
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,300
If you are interested in

1675
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,100
I'll talk to you later when we're free

1676
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,400
Then this place is actually

1677
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,900
Alishan's Great has a great relationship

1678
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,500
Your memorial to Turkey from the west

1679
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,000
next to the sea of â€‹â€‹love or greece

1680
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,900
Especially the South China Sea along this sea of â€‹â€‹insects

1681
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,900
i have been to iran

1682
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,000
you see a lot

1683
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,500
Alishan, what was left behind when Alishan came to the earth

1684
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,800
Historic sites

1685
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,700
very very spectacular special

1686
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
you can see a lot

1687
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
But apart from these two movies

1688
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,500
Another thing that is more important to me is this mountain

1689
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,000
this mountain is a volcano

1690
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,500
The name of the mountain is Mong Aralats

1691
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,000
Aralats is a holy mountain

1692
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Two Holy Mountains of Meat in Islam and Christianity

1693
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
This way you will think it is very troublesome

1694
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I also know that probably in Turkey

1695
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
The easternmost country is Armenia

1696
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,500
Near the border with Turkey

1697
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,000
is in the bible

1698
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
When the Great Flood Occurs in the Bible

1699
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Where the Loya's Ark stands

1700
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
We are going to study this mountain next year

1701
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
So if someone signs up

1702
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
consider

1703
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
we this year

1704
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
we are here today

1705
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,500
The place that did the work is here

1706
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
in the southeast of TÃ¼rkiye

1707
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,500
It's on the border of Syria and Iraq.

1708
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,500
almost never go

1709
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,000
If the United States goes to fight Syria

1710
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Good thing he didn't hit

1711
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,500
so we're here to do a job

1712
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,000
Be a geological phenomenon

1713
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,500
Next to this is Iraq, right?

1714
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,500
Iraq is two river basins

1715
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,500
One of the powers of civilized speech

1716
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,600
This thing can be seen while running out of TÃ¼rkiye

1717
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,400
This is the source or upstream of the six-shot bottom box

1718
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:10,900
So you can do address stepping on my drug specimen here

1719
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,000
At the same time, you can take pictures like this

1720
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,500
So every time Mr. Peng said that I went to visit mountains and rivers everywhere

1721
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,000
still get money from congress

1722
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,600
So that's the picture of Curtis in it

1723
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,400
A very important research address

1724
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,200
We call it Type Locality

1725
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,400
Because TÃ¼rkiye has a special collision modeling effect

1726
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,100
The Turks call it the Origin of Turkish Type

1727
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,400
Turkic modeling movement

1728
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,200
because it's like cartoon books 84 million years ago

1729
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,700
between arabia and asia

1730
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,400
It's not just two big plates colliding

1731
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,900
A lot of small microplates are added in the middle

1732
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,800
How did these microplates evolve?

1733
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,900
How did the action come about?

1734
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,700
How to do the interaction in the middle

1735
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,000
Actually a lot of people have interesting address questions here

1736
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,100
So I say it is actually a sandwich-style collision modeling movement

1737
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,700
Except for two pieces of toast

1738
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,800
There is a lot of material in the middle

1739
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,400
waiting for a geologist to do it

1740
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,080
to parse it

1741
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,840
That's what it looks like now

1742
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,840
It's all crowded together

1743
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,040
what to do in the middle

1744
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,040
This separates his material piece by piece

1745
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,480
Then tell us what's going on with the R&D here

1746
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,200
how to solve this place

1747
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,840
The so-called Tectonic Curse Rule in Geology

1748
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,000
structural substance

1749
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,080
There are many, many issues worthy of research

1750
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,840
so we went on a raid

1751
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,800
The most important reason to work is to

1752
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,040
think about researching this

1753
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,040
when setting up this plan

1754
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,440
quickly

1755
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,040
We design three main studies of that interest

1756
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,440
will study the work area

1757
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,840
Study this northernmost point in Arabia

1758
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,840
Crash Peak and lead north

1759
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,640
we from the southeast of iran

1760
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,840
That is, near the border between Iran and Pakistan.

1761
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,440
Then follow this to the northwest

1762
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:54,040
Then finally go to the Protos of this CEIA

1763
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,640
There are a lot of green things after the collision

1764
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,440
research activity

1765
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,040
we want to do with these things

1766
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,960
Then new observations then suggest that we are in this place

1767
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,460
have new explanations or models

1768
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,960
I'll show you a few examples soon.

1769
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,460
This is my job as a PhD student

1770
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:14,160
just along this usual place

1771
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:16,760
I call it the Gangdi Stone Mountain in West Asia

1772
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,660
Or the Antistone Mountains in West Asia

1773
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,060
OK so again

1774
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,200
Let's do this first and pull this arabic block out

1775
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,960
Then attribute the ancient Mediterranean or this special ocean to the

1776
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,920
Then Tedi Shiyang went north to do hidden work at that time

1777
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,320
Here to create something like today's Gangdi Stone Mountain

1778
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,560
Let's get to know its time distribution

1779
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,760
Then its rock-technical tailoring

1780
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,620
and then to understand what the structure of the place looked like before the collision

1781
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,220
It takes a little hard work like this

1782
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,820
no one has done it before

1783
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,520
My doctoral research

1784
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:54,260
This Gangdi stone mountain in West Asia has done a series of sampling and analysis work

1785
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:56,520
This Gangdi Stone Mountain has a special name

1786
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,960
Then there are two place names, the nameless is the lake

1787
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:06,160
There is a big lake called Wumingye

1788
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,040
Dota is that name for a little trip here

1789
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,160
Dota, the meaning of Persian painting is simply Dotr

1790
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,760
So it's easy to remember, the name of that city is Dotr

1791
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,040
I asked my Iranian friend why the city is called Dotr

1792
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,760
He said he didn't know, he couldn't take the test

1793
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,760
Anyway, this is the belt

1794
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:26,560
We have done the most detailed chronology and geochemistry ever done along this belt

1795
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,160
So the paper that published the lead film is the first one

1796
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,000
There will be other things in the future

1797
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,960
It can be discussed that the initial state of collision orogeny in this place

1798
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,120
Then what is its boundary condition like?

1799
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,240
More broadly, the so-called Zogras Origin

1800
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:44,280
Because the mountain in Iran is called Zogras Mountain

1801
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,680
This location is here, Zogras Mountain is here

1802
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:50,560
If it corresponds to the east, it is the Himalayas in the south of Tibet.

1803
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,760
So the Himalayas in Iran are called Zogras

1804
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:56,040
Then in a broad sense, we call it Zogras Origin

1805
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:59,320
It can also start to control or discuss this thing

1806
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,720
The example given is that the end time of the delay event just now is not at the same time

1807
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,940
This English name is Decronus

1808
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,700
The translation of the mainland is called time-traversing through time

1809
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,220
It's just that the time is different

1810
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:15,520
end time in the northwest

1811
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,720
Northwest of Iran is about 25 million years

1812
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,360
The end of the event will be postponed around 25 million years

1813
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,020
Then in the middle it becomes 15 million years

1814
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,560
end around 15 million years

1815
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,720
It will be about 6 to 7 million years to the south

1816
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:30,740
So it ends time gradually towards the south

1817
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:36,000
The local inspection means that the collision between Arabia and Eurasia in this place is

1818
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,400
this place happened first

1819
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,440
After the occurrence, the Arab reaction will produce in reality

1820
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:41,960
No Rotation in reverse time

1821
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:42,800
come up

1822
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,240
Then turn off this special episode Shiyang in the middle

1823
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,040
then collide collide together

1824
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,840
so this is the place

1825
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,680
The first constraint that prolongs the age of activity

1826
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,800
Let's discuss the role of this collision

1827
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,960
or that plate suture in this place is

1828
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,960
Diaclomus

1829
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,500
Yes, that phenomenon

1830
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:07,240
Then my other postdoctoral fellow is Peng Junneng

1831
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,040
It's the postdoctoral fellow from Hong Kong

1832
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:10,540
Also did a lot of work locally

1833
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:12,840
and found something very interesting

1834
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,500
Because of time constraints, I won't talk about him in particular.

1835
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,640
As mentioned earlier, for example,

1836
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,540
we are in some special places

1837
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:22,040
Do detailed work on specific issues

1838
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,040
and then to solve

1839
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,440
The local or specific geological problem

1840
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:29,000
But in the end I hope to be able to synthesize

1841
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,240
Jobs on the west side of the place vs. jobs on the east side

1842
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,040
plus the rest of asia

1843
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,940
Included here includes jobs in South East Asia

1844
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,640
From a more macro perspective

1845
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,140
Asian continent

1846
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,840
The process of evolution of the entire continental crust

1847
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,040
Because the continent of Asia is the largest in the history of the earth

1848
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,140
Since the Avatar

1849
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:49,640
Xianshen seat is since the beginning of the Five Generations

1850
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,940
That's about 540 million years ago

1851
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,840
The most important is the new continental crust

1852
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,000
place of growth

1853
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,040
Then my teacher Jiang Boming

1854
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,600
A lot of jobs that Asians are doing in the previous one

1855
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,800
Then we are now in this Tethyste generation

1856
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,200
Or the follow-up work done in the East Tethyste generation

1857
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,900
Finally, you can hope that you can combine

1858
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,800
something related to this

1859
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,900
Make a more macroscopic explanation of the whole of Asia

1860
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:19,200
In it it's the finale of my end

1861
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,200
But the research is actually halfway through

1862
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,900
is from 2011

1863
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:28,300
To be carried out until 2026

1864
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,600
Chinese and English together

1865
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,400
Pretty nice

1866
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,200
2016 is now exactly in the middle of the third year

1867
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,400
So it's less than two halves

1868
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,600
Another two and a half years to work

1869
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,400
Maybe I can really sing the finale later

1870
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,800
So before singing the real finale

1871
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,200
Thinking of Bobby

1872
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,000
The famous song is called Blood in the wind

1873
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,200
there is a line in it

1874
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:51,000
i borrow to be my end

1875
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,800
èªªHow many years can a mountain exist

1876
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,000
before it's washed away to the sea?

1877
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,900
The answer is

1878
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,200
Lowing in the wind

1879
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,160
I can't find the answer in minutes

1880
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,360
But we will continue to do our create research project

1881
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,720
hope in the near future

1882
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,280
I can introduce more things to you

1883
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,800
I'll stop here thank you

1884
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,400
Thanks

1885
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:20,440
Thank you Mr. Zhang for this wonderful introduction

1886
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,280
And he has good timing

1887
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,760
It will be over in about 80 minutes

1888
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:28,280
So we have a lot of time for Q&A

1889
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,760
The first comment is

1890
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,040
I seem to have chosen the wrong line

1891
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,600
I should learn the address from him

1892
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,680
that open scenery

1893
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,800
OK

1894
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,000
ok we open to

1895
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
everyone can ask questions

1896
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,960
good

1897
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,760
Then you use your microphone to

1898
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,400
Press the green one

1899
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,680
Teacher, can I ask you?

1900
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:53,480
You just talked about this MD-43 in Asia

1901
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,000
It was originally bent

1902
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,520
Or because it was bent by the Indian continent

1903
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,600
I thought he was smoother

1904
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,600
Because India only squeezed after meeting

1905
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,900
When the Frenchman just said

1906
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,500
He escaped, but he didn't

1907
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
If you escape, it's just not a squeeze.

1908
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,900
No, escaping is another phenomenon

1909
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,100
It actually has something to do with the bending process.

1910
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:19,700
He did come and escape

1911
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,400
But the mechanism by which he escaped

1912
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,800
will escape time french

1913
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,200
we think they are wrong

1914
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,800
Okay, thank you

1915
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,600
good

1916
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,000
that teacher

1917
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,800
Thank you for your introduction

1918
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,400
Because according to the three generations, the two

1919
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,800
Collision of different plate shapes

1920
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,000
Well said

1921
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,100
That is, if the oceanic plates collide

1922
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,000
I want to generate something like North or South America

1923
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Andis Sanmai

1924
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,100
This is the so-called rocky rivers and lakes

1925
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,400
Nazagors or Turkine

1926
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,100
Up-to-date on this last PhD study

1927
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,800
I have a curious

1928
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,800
I think Taiwan happens to be the same

1929
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,100
I have 600 better

1930
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,080
Ocean version, but where is the lava lake on our side?

1931
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,480
There is a magma lake. The ocean mountain range is mainly a magma lake that travels to the island lake.

1932
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:16,120
Then if you go to the north, Chancellor Mountain, many people say it is a magma lake that continues to Ryukyu Island Lake

1933
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:17,160
so there are still

1934
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:22,520
It's just that Taiwan's spatial scale is very small

1935
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:27,640
So there are certain difficulties in parsing, plus

1936
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:33,280
The time scale is very short, and the step of Taiwan is about five or six million years ago

1937
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:38,140
Compared with Tibet, Tibet is about 50 to 60 million years old

1938
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:45,300
Then its scale is 3,000 kilometers wide. I am more than 3,000 kilometers wide, and Taiwan is only about 300 kilometers long.

1939
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,860
So time and space belong to Tibet

1940
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,980
One-tenth, one Ode is missing, if one Ode is missing, it can be done in geology

1941
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:54,260
simulation possible

1942
01:22:54,260 --> 01:23:00,100
Space is easy to control, but time is very difficult to control, because the geological time is five or six million years

1943
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,600
In chronology and dating, it is not easy to determine accurately

1944
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,200
So Taiwan has a Taiwan problem

1945
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:12,800
I also accidentally did some Taiwanese work

1946
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,880
So if Mr. Peng invites me to come again in the future

1947
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:18,180
Next time I will tell you about Taiwan

1948
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,720
But Taiwan does have

1949
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:24,320
But there is no way to do a one-on-one parallel

1950
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:28,160
Contrast because of the problem of time and space

1951
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:29,960
I am a teacher, but

1952
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:33,540
I had a question just now and I just forgot to say it

1953
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,360
If it's North America, the one you're talking about

1954
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,700
Himalayan side huh? His lava dance is granite

1955
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:43,000
The problem is we are thinking about Taiwan

1956
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,320
Of course I know that the scale is much different, and

1957
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:52,220
Because there is an order difference, and both North America and the Himalayas started more than 60 million years ago

1958
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:57,600
Your question is very very good and has been well thought out since I do this

1959
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,140
Because of time I can't speak too deeply

1960
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,240
or too rigid

1961
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,040
So simplifies skipping a lot of stuff

1962
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,640
Many of the three Legis veins in North America are granite rocks

1963
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:13,640
Yes, then Gandisan in Tibet

1964
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,040
It is also mainly granite

1965
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,740
We call these flower steel rocks

1966
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:19,140
Qingluyan in volcanic petrology

1967
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,440
Qingluyan means

1968
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,940
It wasn't created by a volcanic eruption to the surface

1969
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:25,240
It is after a certain depth underground

1970
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,440
Slowly cools and turns into a green rock mass

1971
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,840
And now it means to come to the surface

1972
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,440
like the example of tibetan kandishan

1973
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:35,240
We know Candisian was underground

1974
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,940
It's underground, some places are 20 kilometers deep

1975
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,540
formed a stone

1976
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,740
Now it's on the surface

1977
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:43,340
so tell us

1978
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,640
When Tibet was colliding with Taiwan's depth

1979
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:49,040
20 kilometers thick on the surface

1980
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,040
The stone that covered it has been eroded away

1981
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,940
Now it's all moved to the sea

1982
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,340
move into the bay of bengal

1983
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,140
or other grade powder inside

1984
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:56,840
for example

1985
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:59,240
So it puts the green dew rock under the ground

1986
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:00,140
Flower dry rock exposure

1987
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
come on the surface

1988
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,200
Very different from this is that the Andes are in South America

1989
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,200
The gate volcanoes of the Andes are all extrusive rocks

1990
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,200
called Kanak rocks

1991
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,600
So it's a volcanic rock

1992
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:13,500
So there should be a lot of dew rocks under it

1993
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,400
something like granite

1994
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,800
but not yet exposed to the surface

1995
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,600
Then to the example of Iran

1996
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,200
we actually see the same thing

1997
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,400
Inside the Andes Mountains in West Asia, Iran

1998
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,300
We are the young underbelly

1999
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,300
The young samurai compared to the one at the initial stage

2000
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:33,700
So its body and wave stone are not so powerful

2001
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:37,100
So that UDMA there

2002
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:40,100
The magma fire in West Asia I just mentioned

2003
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,300
extrusive rock

2004
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,700
like the andes example

2005
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,900
So the difference between the entire Tibet and the Iranian viaduct is

2006
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:50,200
this is mature

2007
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:53,100
So its average altitude is 4500 meters high

2008
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,500
means it is set high

2009
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,600
During the high stage

2010
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,100
At the same time there are many things on the surface

2011
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,900
The cover is smashed

2012
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,000
was moved to sea

2013
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
to the west in the iranian caucasus

2014
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Its average altitude is only 1000 meters high

2015
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
The plateau is only 1000 meters high

2016
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
So it's a younger version of that dirty

2017
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
so it's just starting to melt

2018
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Peeling isn't that great

2019
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
And the wind in that place is not like the wind in the Indian Ocean

2020
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
so not so much moisture

2021
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
erosion the degree of surface erosion

2022
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
much lighter than the east

2023
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I have an answer do you have a question

2024
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Thank you, teacher

2025
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Our South Australian Edition

2026
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Does that count?

2027
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
South Australia

2028
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
electric eye

2029
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
South Australia

2030
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
collision collision

2031
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So the Great South Australia or

2032
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
you to telugu country

2033
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
won't you see district nine

2034
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Marble, right?

2035
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I saw a lot of people in the prison area are very powerful

2036
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Dungeon area

2037
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
said

2038
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
severe deformation

2039
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Monolithic not rigid deformation

2040
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yes or no

2041
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,800
It deformed at a high temperature and pressure

2042
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,400
If we push the pressure to the depth

2043
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:11,700
It should be a stone 10 kilometers underground

2044
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,700
it produces that deformation

2045
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,900
Therefore, in the Taroko National Pressure Industry Co., Ltd.

2046
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:19,900
Many rocks are about 10 kilometers underground

2047
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:21,700
Then because of the collision with Zhaoshan

2048
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,500
Then Taishan and then surface wave time

2049
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,900
now brought to the surface

2050
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,300
seen by us

2051
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,900
The mechanism is much the same

2052
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:32,900
who

2053
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:36,400
Hello teacher, thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2054
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,400
what i want to ask is

2055
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,400
as the teacher said at the beginning

2056
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,400
The scale of the teacher's research is very large

2057
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,400
But throughout the speech

2058
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:49,400
Always comparing Tibet with the CIA

2059
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:52,400
However, what I want to ask the teacher here is to say

2060
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,400
Then in such a large-scale comparison

2061
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,400
There are some

2062
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,400
Maybe I don't know it's a violation of influence

2063
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,900
or have a major impact

2064
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,000
May I ask how do you get rid of this kind of research?

2065
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
For example, just now you mentioned

2066
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Turkish researchers put their place

2067
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
called a TÃ¼rkiye shape

2068
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
There are many small plates in the middle

2069
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
then it's like a sandwich

2070
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Then how can you say

2071
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
The Turkish one can be used as

2072
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Early model of Tibet

2073
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Could it be TÃ¼rkiye because of those little plates in the middle

2074
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
So his whole future

2075
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
His development is actually different from that of Tibet.

2076
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Two stories, so let's say

2077
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
this place

2078
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
If you're excluding the model of that sandwich

2079
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
would you do this

2080
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
that if you want

2081
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Why do you feel like these factors

2082
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
You can choose and exclude, thank you

2083
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Your question is the stuff I'm going to write a thesis on

2084
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
so ask him to put you in place

2085
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
There's really no way to make a direct comparison.

2086
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,000
there are many in the middle

2087
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I have a slide in front of me

2088
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
There are many similarities

2089
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
many similarities

2090
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
But in fact there are more differences

2091
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It should be as simple as we think

2092
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,400
want its similarities

2093
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,160
But after doing this work

2094
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,400
In fact, finding the differences may be more important

2095
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:07,300
that needs an explanation

2096
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,300
or a place worthy of study

2097
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,200
So there is really no way to make a professional comparison between the two things.

2098
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,900
Then there are a lot of details in the middle

2099
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,800
i can't speak

2100
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,100
Or I'm doing something related right now

2101
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,300
Eventually is what you point out

2102
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:23,000
there's something we're going to do

2103
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,300
Thanks

2104
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:28,800
Hello, professor, what I want to ask is

2105
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,800
May I ask that the mountain on the light barrier plateau can

2106
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,600
so high

2107
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,600
Then the plateau can be like this

2108
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,100
such a large area

2109
01:29:37,100 --> 01:29:40,400
and then in the world there is no

2110
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,800
One is that the area of â€‹â€‹a plateau can be so large

2111
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,600
a mountain

2112
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,400
Mountains that grow every year

2113
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,100
mountains can be taller than them

2114
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,200
What are his conditions?

2115
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,500
there are several answers

2116
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,800
English

2117
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,600
because there is no standard answer

2118
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,940
What are the conditions?

2119
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:07,840
I have studied this Tibet for many years

2120
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,140
when i spoke from the beginning

2121
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:12,440
The questions you ask are all questions that I want to solve or answer

2122
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,100
or a question that many people want to answer

2123
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,400
So every time I started doing it ten years ago

2124
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,040
Every speech should say these things

2125
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,340
But because I've been talking for so many years

2126
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,800
so i forget about him now

2127
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,200
or don't want to talk about it

2128
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,740
Because no one has been able to answer so far

2129
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:32,680
It seems a bit arrogant to say that.

2130
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,880
But there are many difficult answers in the middle

2131
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:43,480
Like one of our opponents, a professor at UCL called Harrison

2132
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,180
He often said that Tibet is unique in his speeches

2133
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,080
so do tibetan research

2134
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,880
There is no way to apply to any other shape in

2135
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,340
Any other shape gaining knowledge

2136
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:54,680
There is no way to apply to Tibet

2137
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:58,880
So this is the core part of your question

2138
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,480
This is UCL

2139
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,600
The so-called big name is called the National Academy of Sciences

2140
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:07,680
How dare he speak so loudly

2141
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,980
Why is the new assembly so high?

2142
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,060
Simply put, India collides with Asia

2143
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,340
indian asian crash

2144
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:17,400
So India started colliding around 60 million years ago

2145
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,680
but after the collision

2146
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,560
The speed still continues to be measured according to the current GPS global satellite positioning

2147
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,160
It still continues to make relative motion to the north at the speed of 4 cm every year

2148
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,700
didn't quite stop

2149
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:33,040
So the category that pushes north is obviously the main support

2150
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,340
Why can support Tibet be folded up so high

2151
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,360
then always

2152
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,660
High spin does not collapse there

2153
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:42,500
According to the model of mountain movement, it means that the mountain grows to a certain height

2154
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,300
When the balance of variety shows cannot be maintained

2155
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,580
it's going to collapse

2156
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:47,620
But Tibet is very strange

2157
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:53,000
It has been maintained for 5 or 6 ten million years, but it will not collapse for 50 or 60 million years

2158
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,560
There must be some special mechanism

2159
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,840
So there are many special mechanisms

2160
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,340
Including our article also thought about some

2161
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
let me explain

2162
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,600
But this one has a lot of details

2163
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,000
So if you are really interested

2164
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
That doesn't seem to be very respectful of your question.

2165
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,700
If you want to know more details

2166
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,100
maybe after that is over

2167
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:15,300
I can specifically explain some details to you

2168
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:15,900
okay

2169
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:19,300
In this way, can I have to take a class before I can speak?

2170
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,000
Come to the Department of Geology, National Taiwan University

2171
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
sorry professor

2172
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Can I ask you some historical gossip

2173
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,500
I know where the voice comes from

2174
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,500
later

2175
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,000
OK good

2176
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
you just mentioned that

2177
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
On the holy mountain there may be Noah Fang

2178
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
not i mentioned

2179
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
stories in the bible

2180
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,500
The holy mountain mentioned in Noah Fang State is that mountain

2181
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,500
Don't know means you are in the process of investigating

2182
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,000
is there some history

2183
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,500
There are some foundational governments on earth that can prove

2184
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,000
No

2185
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
is indirect

2186
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
then you can you just mentioned

2187
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I donâ€™t know if you have heard some stories that are different from the Greek mythology we read in the local investigation

2188
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:12,000
You didn't either She didn't even have the Trojan horse and now the new Trojan horse looks ugly

2189
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It's better in the movie

2190
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
the problem is

2191
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech. The question I want to ask the teacher is in the history of the earth.

2192
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Has there ever been a plateau as large as Tibet?

2193
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Same question as him, tried not to answer, and here you are again

2194
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
But Mr. Luo Xinghua, a graduate of our fourth department, is a student and is now a teacher at the University of Hong Kong.

2195
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
The University of Hong Kong is called that question that is so difficult to answer

2196
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
There are many speculations or guesses whether there is a similar situation with Tibet

2197
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:50,000
One of the conjectures is that the mainland scholars said that China's North China

2198
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
North China Block æˆ–North China Crayton

2199
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
During the Mesozoic Era, because of the collision of the North China road blocks

2200
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
May have been so tall by Taiwanese

2201
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,400
There are many low thickenable speech like

2202
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,800
Ela Kaiz That Formation

2203
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,100
So they said that once in the Zhongzheng Dynasty

2204
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,400
had the eastern part of china

2205
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,700
There used to be a plateau as large as Tibet

2206
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,900
but only explanations or doctrines

2207
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,100
or speculation

2208
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,400
yes many people believe

2209
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,800
There are also many people who do not believe

2210
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:18,100
Then apply it to the past history of the earth

2211
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:19,900
because the time is longer

2212
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:23,600
This is the problem of geological record keeping.

2213
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,200
so it's hard to really do a direct comparison

2214
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,500
So I still can't answer you

2215
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,600
some problems

2216
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,200
problem to i have a problem

2217
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,500
you come as a tour guide

2218
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,100
We use the guide this geologist's

2219
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:42,400
It shows that Huangshan in the Huangshan mainland is very famous

2220
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,700
I haven't been there yet

2221
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,700
Granite Huangshan

2222
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:49,600
Like the mountain in Zhangjiajie

2223
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,700
That geology is very famous

2224
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:53,100
I thought you were there

2225
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,800
Have you ever been to Zhangjiajie?

2226
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:56,300
nor

2227
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,000
then you go

2228
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,200
I've been there

2229
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
The three mountains are different

2230
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
he might be able to speak better for me

2231
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
The geology of Huangshan and the mountains of Zhangjiajie

2232
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
it was the sea

2233
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
then the table rises

2234
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
then bluestone

2235
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Then the geology is different

2236
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Huangshan is Huajiangyan

2237
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Hua Jiangyanâ€™s words are actually similar to South Chinaâ€™s

2238
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
The one in the southeast of China

2239
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
When Zhou Shen took

2240
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
very broad

2241
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Especially in the second season of Bai

2242
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Very extensive Huaganyan activities are related

2243
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Nahua Dry Rock Activities

2244
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
At that time, the general explanation was that

2245
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
When in Zhongzheng belt

2246
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
At that time there was the ancient Pacific Ocean

2247
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Four percent of the ocean in the ancient Pacific

2248
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Submerged in the northwest direction

2249
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So in the southeast of what is now China

2250
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
the southeastern edge of Asia

2251
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Formed a time like the Antize Hills

2252
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
something like that

2253
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
So the flower dry rock in Huangshan is

2254
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
A bunch of flower dry rock activities

2255
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,360
A product of the Huochen activity looks like this

2256
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,600
Then he is Hualei Rock

2257
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,640
So the position he invaded

2258
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,840
The flower bud rock in Huangshan should not be so deep at the beginning

2259
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,080
It should be at a depth of five to ten kilometers

2260
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,200
So the five to ten kilometers on the surface

2261
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,840
After the crust peeled off

2262
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,440
Then he lays on top of that

2263
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:18,880
As for why Huangshan looks so good-looking

2264
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,840
This is beyond the scope of address science

2265
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,840
I can't help you pour oil

2266
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,280
That Zhangjialu is a dungeon

2267
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,360
I found that I eat food so far away

2268
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:28,600
but because i've been

2269
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,240
The Danxia Mountain in Guangdong

2270
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,640
if you have been

2271
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,040
Those who haven't been can go and see

2272
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,640
That too

2273
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:38,160
not exactly similar

2274
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,560
But itâ€™s basically the same dungeon with minor differences

2275
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:45,200
It was from the time of the Mesozoic Era

2276
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,000
The mainland in South China is a stable one

2277
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,360
platform is called platform

2278
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,000
There are a lot of

2279
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,960
The itinerary with a lot of limestone in Lampton

2280
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,840
and then at the same time some

2281
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,640
The dungeon itinerary in Silent Rock

2282
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,880
but then

2283
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:06,140
The so-called orogeny from Baierji to the Cenozoic Era

2284
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:12,020
It took a lot of talking about that orogeny

2285
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,520
Because many experts have different models

2286
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,020
So I better not be exposed in it

2287
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:19,780
Then it starts from the Shenxi environment of the diving sea

2288
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:22,780
Then it became the present land heart

2289
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:26,120
Then mainly Taiwan is born above sea level

2290
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,620
If the Taiwan grows above sea level, it will accept erosion

2291
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,720
As long as the principle is below sea level

2292
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,020
You are Think

2293
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:37,020
You can accept Luyuan to Shenxi environment there

2294
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:38,520
But once above sea level

2295
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,520
you become more than erosion benchmarks equal to

2296
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:42,520
You become the source of erosion

2297
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,520
Then start to accept the later erosion

2298
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,020
Probably it should be like this

2299
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,020
Okay, thank you

2300
01:37:49,020 --> 01:37:51,520
is there any problem

2301
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:56,520
teacher, i want to ask

2302
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,520
You just said you could know a certain rock

2303
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,300
Travel a few kilometers below the surface

2304
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,340
then i want to know which one

2305
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:06,900
How does he know how many kilometers he travels?

2306
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,940
Thanks

2307
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:10,240
A few kilometers of travel, for example, in the case of Huaganye

2308
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:13,300
Kanno has some special minerals

2309
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,360
Special minerals are most common

2310
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,140
do we have walls of kangaroo here

2311
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:19,200
Or have you seen that kangaroo has three main minerals

2312
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,980
his name is mineralogy

2313
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,280
with quartz

2314
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:23,560
is a transparent mineral

2315
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,600
So the one in Huakanye

2316
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,640
translucent or transparent mineral

2317
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,700
The most transparent mineral is quartz

2318
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:33,280
In addition to quartz, there is a white mineral called feldspar

2319
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:38,920
Feldspar is opaque but mainly white so that sometimes it will be a little hairy

2320
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,700
the red mineral

2321
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:43,280
And then there's another mineral called Feather Mother

2322
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,820
The feather mother is black and easy to see, often in pieces

2323
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,620
will see these minerals

2324
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:50,940
Except that this mineral is sometimes compared

2325
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,740
We call it the more neutral Huakanye

2326
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:55,820
In fact, you will see in diorite or diorite diorite

2327
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:57,860
A black mineral called amphibole

2328
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:00,020
foot amphibole sure you have a chance to see if you go

2329
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,160
Datun Mountain, Yangming Mountain, National Park

2330
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,100
Look at those words of Anshan eye

2331
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,700
you can easily see stepping stones

2332
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:10,000
how do we know its intrusive formation

2333
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,200
What about the cooling temperature and pressure of the magma?

2334
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,600
to analyze the minerals in it

2335
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,600
especially stepping stones or mica

2336
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:19,500
feldspar composition

2337
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:21,500
Feldspar these minerals

2338
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:23,600
There is a mass of elements

2339
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:28,300
It is related to temperature and pressure

2340
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,500
So according to this comparison

2341
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:33,200
We can build something called a geothermometer

2342
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:34,500
or geometer stuff

2343
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:38,600
So look at some special minerals in it

2344
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,400
What is the mass of chemical composition

2345
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,700
We can calculate its equilibrium temperature and equilibrium pressure

2346
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:44,700
like this

2347
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:45,400
pressure from balance

2348
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,600
How deep can we push it

2349
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,200
So we can put this rock mass

2350
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,700
or the temperature and pressure at which this rock crystallizes or cools

2351
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,100
can be calculated

2352
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,200
no difference from now on

2353
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,900
No difference, because it's too much trouble to hold hands

2354
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,100
so that detail

2355
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Thanks

2356
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Well, if there's no problem, we have one more

2357
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Teacher, listened to so much heavy stuff tonight

2358
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I want to ask a simple question

2359
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I'm curious, since when did the teacher become interested in stones?

2360
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
something so hard and so hard

2361
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
how can it be so funny

2362
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Because I think many children will come to participate today

2363
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
they are

2364
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
The standard answer is that I became interested after I entered the Department of Geology at National Taiwan University

2365
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
just started

2366
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Actually no, I wasnâ€™t very interested in it when I entered the Department of Geology at National Taiwan University.

2367
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
My senior is here, he might fine me at this time

2368
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I didn't know what to do until after I graduated from college

2369
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
At that time I wanted to be a soldier

2370
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
just give society to do something else

2371
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,780
but i met a good teacher

2372
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:03,640
My teacher is Chen Zhenhong

2373
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,340
Maybe you've heard his name

2374
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:11,380
He was the former vice chairman of Congress

2375
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:13,780
If you've ever watched the congressional news

2376
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:16,280
Called Hi by Chen Zhenhong

2377
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:19,080
so let me go to his grad school

2378
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:25,060
And from then on that one went on this road of no return

2379
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:27,060
Only discovered after the point of no return

2380
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:27,920
interested in this

2381
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:32,420
Maybe it's not necessarily what I wanted to do when I was a child

2382
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:33,220
specially bred

2383
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:34,320
when you infoed in it

2384
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:35,120
and found inside

2385
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:37,200
there are some fun things

2386
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:39,500
At least you can go sightseeing, right?

2387
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,160
But some people don't like traveling

2388
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,860
On the contrary, I feel that it is very hard to go there.

2389
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,360
like many kids nowadays

2390
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,900
No, no, a kid from the Department of Geology, National Taiwan University

2391
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:49,400
You have to ask him to climb that mountain

2392
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:50,540
or go there to play

2393
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:52,780
he will find it fun

2394
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:57,620
There are many homeboys and homegirls in the Geology Department of National Taiwan University

2395
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:59,580
If you also like to travel in mountains and rivers

2396
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,080
Must be ranked

2397
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
if running outside

2398
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,800
In fact, geology or technical science

2399
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,800
there should be many

2400
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:11,800
The interests that can be cultivated are in it

2401
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:16,800
That's why I became interested after I entered the Geology Department of National Taiwan University.

2402
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:18,300
actually right

2403
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:22,400
The so-called gas station on the ground is completely out of the field, which is very hard.

2404
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:25,000
no air condition

2405
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,800
There may not be breakfast, there may not be anything

2406
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,600
It's hard work being outside

2407
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:34,100
Assuming a joke, I went to Sumen University to run wild at the beginning of a year

2408
01:42:34,100 --> 01:42:37,000
with one of my new postdocs

2409
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,800
Then after renting for one night, he told me the next day

2410
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:43,600
Why doesn't this hotel have a shower head in the bathroom

2411
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:54,200
OK, we finally thank Mr. Dong for his wonderful speech

2412
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:56,400
let's be a lot of rocks

2413
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,800
Thank you puffs thank you

2414
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
You
