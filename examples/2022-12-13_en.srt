Academia Sinica's 111-year Knowledge Feast

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
before the speech

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let us first ask the director-general of the China Education and Culture Foundation

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Mr. Wang Jianya awarded us the 110th annual

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wu Renshu, a researcher, came to the stage to accept the award

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and a group photo

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thanks

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then we also asked Vice President Huang to take a group photo with us

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is a very big book cage for a very important person of the year social sciences

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Congratulations to Mr. Wu, please go back to your seat first

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's first invite Mr. Wang Jianya, the secretary-general of the China Golden Crystal Association, to give us a speech

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Vice President Huang Researcher Wu Academia Sinica

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Colleagues from the highest academic unit, hello everyone

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hello everyone

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This Hu Shi Foundation was established in the 54th year of the Republic of China

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
so look at him

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,760
It's almost 60 years now

32
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,900
However, this 60-year

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,500
The words of the China Education and Culture Foundation

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,600
We're almost 100 years old so in short

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,900
Let me introduce the China Education and Culture Foundation

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,240
It's about following the payout

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,440
It was during the Manchu Qing Dynasty that the Eight-Power Allied Forces

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
attack the party

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
to this

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,160
When the city of Beijing burned down in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,000
So the Eight-Power Allied Forces paid compensation to Zi at that time

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,500
At that time, the whole of China had about 400 million people.

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,340
At that time, it was 10,000,000, 40,000,000

44
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,400
40,000,000, then each person will pay one or two yuan

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,440
So it's 40,000 taels

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,600
Your history should be very clear

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,960
After the compensation, of course there will be some military expenses.

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,560
The military expenditure of the Eight-Nation Allied Forces, these many blessings

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,600
at that time so

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,920
When the government at that time was negotiating with the United States

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
of course

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,320
The other eight coalitions France Germany

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,160
There are also blessings

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,060
But the United States they admit

55
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,320
These are more parts of the blessing

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,760
returned to the government at that time

57
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,120
So about ten million

58
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,800
More than ten million dollars, that's a lot

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
a lot of money

60
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,520
but at that time it was a

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,200
Under the situation of warlord separatism

62
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,960
So at that time the U.S. government decided to establish

63
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,520
Chinese Education and Culture Foundation

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,800
is an independent foundation

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
the president at that time

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,520
maybe you should all know

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,960
It's President Cao Kun

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,600
So our China Education and Culture Foundation

69
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,800
The mid-term meeting was established in the 24th year of the Republic of China

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,840
we still have

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,560
President Cao Kun

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Seal established

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,560
In the 24th year of the Republic of China, with Academia Sinica

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
It's a little late for us

75
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,960
Academia Sinica is the 28th year of the Republic of China

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,760
It burned us for four years

77
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,520
So we are in two years

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,040
just a hundred years

79
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
that is

80
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,320
Republic of China

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,320
first foundation

82
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,540
a hundred years in two years

83
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,700
In fact, this hundred years

84
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,160
We do very, very much especially in

85
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,100
in the early days because it was

86
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,860
The dollar is very small so we

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,440
Using these we've sponsored so many

88
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Because I was going abroad

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,680
do whatever you want to do conference

90
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
the equipment you want

91
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,680
all in dollars so we

92
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,580
During these hundred years

93
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,540
In fact, it has been

94
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,200
Talk to all our academic units

95
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,760
From various institutes of Academia Sinica

96
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,660
And we communicated with Qingda

97
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,060
Academic units have a lot of cooperation

98
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,580
Then we have a lot of cooperation with Academia Sinica

99
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,840
right now in this

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,300
Hu Foundation

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Currently 60 years

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
still we uphold the same

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The original intention almost 100 years ago

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We want to be an independent

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Education and Culture Foundation

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can help all education in Taiwan

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
With the development of various cultural projects

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In addition to what the government can do

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Of course now the government

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
May be right for Chinese culture

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This promotion is not so much

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
then our foundation

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Will do more Chinese culture

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is 100 years ago

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
98 years ago, our Central Accounting Association was founded

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
terminate us till now

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
have not changed

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we will keep doing it

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let me introduce it like this

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000

And distinguished guests, it's quite cold today

131
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,460
So everyone listening to speeches in cold weather

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,500
is good to enjoy

133
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,540
And Professor Wang's speech must be very exciting

134
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,960
Actually he is us

135
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,160
In China, social economy in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

136
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,860
a famous person in history

137
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,860
In fact, many listeners also know him

138
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,360
He has written quite a lot

139
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,860
and it's exciting

140
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,960
Especially the information he used

141
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,360
are very omnivorous

142
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,560
And delicate things like this

143
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,960
Then his speech today

144
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,660
history

145
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,860
combined with this criminology

146
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,960
to give an explanation

147
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,420
this is not easy

148
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,560
But in terms of his eloquence

149
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,260
must be very exciting

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There is one today, can you wait and see?

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's Xier's court

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
then i won't say anything

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I hope we invite Professor Wu to give us a lecture

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Thanks

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Vice President Huang Director Wang Distinguished Guests

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hope you all have a great night tonight

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, I am very honored to be the speaker of Hu Shi's lecture today

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Then I am even more honored to be able to receive from Director Wang

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Get this very memorable lecture

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
thank you all

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,300
In fact, the Central Product Association is not only a unit with a long history

162
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,040
At the same time, he has made great contributions to the academic and educational aspects of modern China.

163
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,200
play a very important role

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I recently studied the modern Chinese agricultural students in this ruler

165
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,700
You can still see that Zhongji will be inside

166
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,300
Support many Chinese international students to study abroad

167
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,000
So I see this kind of material and feel it myself

168
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,200
It is a great honor to receive this award

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,500
Everyone knows the biggest dark horse in this year's World Cup

170
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,200
It's Morocco, he made it to the semi-finals

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,000
His coach once said a word

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
He said as long as you have faith

173
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,400
Achievement without talent

174
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
I always thought I had no talent

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
no genius

176
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,800
But I am very happy to be recognized by this award this time

177
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Then I will keep working hard

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,600
create better books

179
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
To repay the attention you have given me

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,900
Then because time is limited

181
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll go straight to our topic

182
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,700
Well, what I want to introduce to you today is

183
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Actually it was me recently

184
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,000
One of my students just finished a book

185
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,900
The content of this book is to discuss

186
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,000
the crime of the mid-nineteenth century

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,600
especially the problem of theft

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,700
So I want to say that in this speech

189
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,000
I especially focus on history and criminology

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,500
how to meet

191
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,700
How the two research methods fit together

192
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,500
to explore the question of criminal history

193
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,100
This picture is very interesting

194
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,700
It was painted in the nineteenth century

195
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,500
When Westerners came to China

196
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,100
An image painted about the outside of Chongqing City

197
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Next we will enter

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and record it in the content of the speech

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,200
As far as the discussion is concerned, the eight counties in Sichuan

200
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,000
That is the place in Chongqing now as an example

201
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Let me tell a story first

202
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,500
in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

203
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,000
Especially in the novels of the Ming Dynasty

204
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,700
There is a famous Shinto

205
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,500
also has a supernatural power

206
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,700
Also known as Chivalry

207
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,000
called an eyebrow

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,500
Then according to the second subject of the novel, send the reporter

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,800
Feng Rongrong described

210
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Yimei is a person in the middle of the family

211
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,000
He lives in an alley near Xuanmiao Pot in Suzhou

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Dyed Dragon

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
every time he succeeds in a

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
after stealing

215
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,500
He will draw an eyebrow flower on the wall

216
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,600
draw an eyebrow

217
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
So he called it an eyebrow

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,800
Then the illustrations in this novel

219
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,700
just drew an eyebrow

220
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,000
However, this illustration

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,500
Everyone knows that in this Chinese painting

222
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
This freehand brushwork is better than realism

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So everyone look carefully

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If you don't look carefully, you can't see it

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
this is a plum

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I always feel that it seems to be painting a pot

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then this is freehand words

228
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then the Godhead Will Mei described here

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
it's very powerful

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
seems to have light work

231
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
so it can jump on roofs

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
it can touch the wall

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Coming and going like ghosts and gods coming and going like wind and rain

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
more interesting is

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The things it stole are Tibetan art materials

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What it stole was distributed to many civilians

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So in this novel

238
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Admit it is the world's first thief

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It describes the things it steals

240
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
including its chivalrous behavior

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It sometimes steals deposits from big businessmen

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Sometimes they steal the business of the fourth generation of Fu's family

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
after stealing

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It distributes these operations to civilians

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It will also describe

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
it always misses when it steals

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Sometimes it just happens to be bumped into

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
so how does it get away

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,120
Sometimes when saplings go to this imitation house to steal silver taels

250
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,160
Happened to be locked inside his robe cabinet.

251
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,080
He just figured out how to get out

252
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,600
He will pretend to be a mouse sound

253
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,880
Such family members think that

254
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,280
There are mice in his robe

255
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,200
not open

256
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
he rushed out

257
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,720
take this opportunity to escape

258
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,960
You can also see this sapling

259
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,000
He steals clothes from this clothes store

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,440
You can see this kind of light

261
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,800
chase him at last

262
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
Then find a way when he escapes

263
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,880
just lost a burden

264
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,560
Everyone stopped chasing him because of the burden

265
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,160
Just look at what's in the bag

266
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,920
So

267
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,360
In addition, we also saw that the story described

268
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,560
this one seedling

269
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,440
He is famous because of his godhead

270
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,960
So many people want to bet with him

271
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,680
Said you have the ability to steal something from my house

272
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,920
try it

273
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,800
Including the bet he had with the commander's family

274
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,040
He bet against the gambler

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,640
And he bet against Jiujiaweng

276
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,440
In the end, even with the same strong defense

277
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,640
In the end, they couldn't escape from the hands of the thief Ichimae.

278
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,880
So this is the magical situation that describes how he steals

279
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,080
Sometimes he also teases some people

280
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,920
To tease, for example, the son who likes to show off his wealth

281
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,600
He put the vigilante's quilt in this boat

282
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,480
Sometimes he also teases the priest

283
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,080
This Taoist is unrepentant

284
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,000
The most popular hat at the time with the swing cap

285
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,280
go sightseeing

286
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,800
He just secretly changed the Taoist hat

287
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,440
let these priests play

288
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,000
Also he has an interesting story

289
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,480
It's the reflection of him helping a corrupt official to steal the censor

290
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,560
Although after unsuccessful stealing

291
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,880
This Yizhimei still persuades this current official to say

292
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,040
you still put this

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,080
Guan Ying returned it to Xu Anyi Shi

294
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,920
Because Xu An Yishi is a smart man

295
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,000
is a parent

296
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,160
if you don't pay him back

297
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,640
Maybe Xu Anyishi will be even more unfavorable to you in the end

298
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,080
But this Zixian didn't listen to him

299
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,960
But then the story is very interesting

300
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,360
Because Xu An Yishi is not the real story of Shen You

301
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,760
He thought of a way

302
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
After he found out his official screening had been stolen

303
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,480
He specially invited Zixian to his home for dinner

304
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,600
In the process of eating, there was a sudden fire

305
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,960
When there was a fire, he took the Guanying shell

306
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,360
Empty shell

307
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,080
Just pretend to be the shell of the official movie

308
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,160
Give it to Zixian

309
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,440
you keep it for me

310
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,920
keep it for me

311
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,200
You take it back and keep it for me

312
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm going to fight the fire

313
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,440
This Zixian returned home with an empty Guanying shell

314
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,800
just want to say no

315
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,840
i stole his official movie

316
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,920
Now he's giving me the empty shell

317
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,400
If I don't put the official screening back

318
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
He took it and saw the empty shell

319
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,360
He said I stole it

320
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,440
what to do with this hand

321
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,960
He had no choice but to put the official movie back obediently.

322
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,920
that empty box

323
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,960
Xu Anyi got this

324
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,920
Vis empty box see

325
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,040
about being in

326
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,200
Of course there is plenty of luggage

327
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,960
good guy

328
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,400
It's because your branch line is expensive.

329
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,000
Sure enough, after Xu Anyi found out about this situation,

330
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,600
think of a way right away

331
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,000
turn off this soup

332
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,040
This of course this is an interesting one about

333
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,440
this heroic story

334
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,080
But in this story

335
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,520
we clearly know

336
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,960
A lot of this story is pieced together

337
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
how do you put it together

338
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,960
The most obvious is

339
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,160
He is capable of stealing a house

340
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,600
The one who stole the silver from this generation's father's house

341
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,680
Then why is he still stealing clothes?

342
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,320
Stealing clothes from these clothes shops?

343
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
That is to say

344
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,400
which example

345
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,960
If there is a thief today

346
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,880
Already capable of stealing bank vaults

347
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,920
But why is he going to UNICORO to steal clothes?

348
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,200
so in this story

349
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,360
Of course, a lot of them are pieced together.

350
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,680
but is there such a person

351
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,920
do you have an eyebrow

352
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,680
Until now

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,300
Many scholars have not verified

354
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,900
But I just found out

355
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,640
Yizhimei does have this person

356
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,460
And this person is in Yongzhou Prefecture, Hunan Province

357
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,500
he is an avenue

358
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Then he was cured by an official

359
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
So left this record at that time

360
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,140
So this Yizhimei is indeed someone

361
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,900
but he is not a thief

362
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,100
he is not a thief

363
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,800
he is an avenue

364
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,800
But let's come back and talk about this issue

365
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,200
the study of criminal history

366
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
In fact, the aspect of our past historical research

367
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
getting bigger and bigger

368
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,600
But the study of criminal history itself

369
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,400
but for a long time

370
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,800
arguably underappreciated or ignored

371
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,100
Of course there are several reasons

372
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,200
Because most of the historiography

373
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,800
To focus more on big events

374
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
The outcome of major events in history

375
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,200
such as war, revolution

376
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,000
For example, the war of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

377
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,400
Xinhai Revolution

378
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,100
and the daytime rebellion

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,160
Even local food looting riots

380
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
these are historians past

381
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
very careful things

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,160
But about some everyday crimes

383
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,240
something like a thief

384
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,680
In fact, historians have

385
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,120
I don't pay much attention to this research

386
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,440
Of course not too much research

387
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,400
There is another reason

388
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,120
Issues involving so-called historical materials

389
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,160
The so-called cleverness is hard to come by without rice

390
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
as a historical research

391
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,840
you still have to have history

392
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,320
then it's a pity

393
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,120
History about this theft

394
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,880
like we mentioned

395
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,120
There are some descriptions in the novel notebook novel

396
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,200
Then there are some descriptions in the koan novel

397
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,320
Interpretation is some

398
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,720
In these interpretations left by generations of husbands

399
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,520
There are also some descriptions

400
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,600
But these are sporadic and not enough

401
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,040
We can't see a whole

402
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,320
Holistic aspect of stealing

403
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,480
Well, again, the development of history in the past 20 years

404
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Especially the history of Ming and Qing Dynasties

405
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,640
Especially during the history of the Qing Dynasty

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,960
China has archives of many prefectures, counties and local counties

407
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,440
was excavated

408
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,800
still very complete

409
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,920
in these judicial files

410
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,280
preserve quite a few of these cases of theft.

411
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,600
so that we historians can study

412
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,640
Of course when researching

413
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
We also hope that there will be a breakthrough in the method

414
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,240
So in the study of history in the past

415
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,200
In fact, about the legal system

416
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
Social Phenomena Reflected by Law

417
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,680
Such studies are more common in the past

418
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,800
But now if we want to focus on

419
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,360
when moving to criminal history

420
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,080
we need to update the method

421
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
which i think

422
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,200
We can combine the so-called

423
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,560
Criminology and History

424
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,480
That's what I'm talking about today

425
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,240
Historical criminology is a new direction to do research

426
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,680
then the history of the past

427
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,720
we just mentioned

428
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,760
Pay attention to historical events

429
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,280
Also pay attention to changes in some social structures

430
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,160
legal system

431
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,040
also pay attention to

432
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
litigation process

433
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,680
aka police

434
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,000
such a system

435
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,200
this is us historians past

436
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
more often noticed

437
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,200
criminology

438
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,520
its angle

439
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,720
Let's have some more interesting history

440
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Aspects of development neglected

441
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,800
Except social change is the past

442
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,640
everyone has been

443
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,520
whether history or criminology

444
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,480
other than the important issues that everyone will pay attention to

445
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,520
then the cause of the crime

446
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,440
Also discussed in criminal psychology

447
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,960
perpetrator's motive

448
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
criminal psychology

449
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,080
in criminology

450
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,200
Discuss how to prevent crime

451
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
how to avoid crime

452
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,680
And these angles and this orientation

453
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,520
but our history of the past

454
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,000
less noticeable

455
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,600
so we can try

456
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,560
Using research methods from these two disciplines

457
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,520
combine together

458
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,760
let's have some new discussions

459
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,640
what about here

460
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,360
I will commit crimes by cutting

461
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,880
discuss as an example

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So what's the point of cutting to crime?

463
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
How to do research

464
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,200
First of all, we all feel that

465
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,000
there are all kinds of crime

466
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,500
So what does it matter when it comes to crime?

467
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Next, I will use the eight-line file

468
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,000
As you can see in the example of the eight-line file

469
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is all the eight line files

470
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,500
From Qianlong tide to Xuantong tide

471
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
according to its category

472
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
The statistics of these numbers

473
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Then we can see from here

474
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
cut to this class

475
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
cut to this class in the middle

476
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,500
It is the largest number of almost every trendy bag

477
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
The biggest amount

478
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Especially as I am now discussing the middle of the 19th century

479
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
also when homosexuality

480
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
You see it has more than 3,000 pieces

481
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
That comrade is only ten years old

482
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
you average

483
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
About 200 cases a year

484
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
I feel very sympathetic at this time

485
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
gay tide at that time

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why is he restricting the limit?

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Every year he light theft

488
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He will try more than 200 cases

489
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
it's still theft

490
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He has other cases to be sentenced

491
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So the former constituency

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Especially in the mid-19th century of the Qing Dynasty

493
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Constitutional Officer of the Qing Dynasty

494
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
really busy

495
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
really busy

496
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
For those constitutional officials at that time

497
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
120,000 sympathies from the rainstorm

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It can also be seen from here

499
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
High number of thefts

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
is one thing we should not ignore

501
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Because there are too many of them

502
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Here I also mentioned the eight-line file

503
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The eighth line is now Chongqing

504
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because of the emergence of eight-line files and

505
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so that we can study well

506
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
these theft cases

507
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
good

508
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So let's introduce

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If the law of the Qing Dynasty

510
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
How to judge the so-called

511
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
regulate this law

512
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How to regulate the problem of theft

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
we know qing dynasty

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
General Laws of the Qing Dynasty

515
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
into two categories

516
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
one is green one is green

517
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,500
is a female Dharma

518
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,200
In this law, in the crime of the sword

519
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,800
A few more important points

520
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,000
First of all, it does not emphasize hand bugs

521
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That is, who is leading and who is following

522
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So the big brother who takes the lead is punished more severely.

523
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,800
The little brother I follow is a little lighter

524
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,300
Second, he will pay attention to the problem of offenders and repeat offenders

525
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,400
That is to say, your autumn cut

526
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,500
If you committed a crime

527
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,700
I will give you a lighter punishment

528
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,200
But when you get to the third offense

529
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,200
That's behind the toes

530
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
It's the highest law

531
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,200
But it looks like everyone has two chances

532
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
that you can do it again

533
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,700
The third important principle is called Ji Zhang Lun Punishment

534
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,200
That is to say, for the Qing Dynasty, the theft

535
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,700
Its sentence is based on the value of the items you stole

536
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,600
The higher the value, the higher your judgment

537
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,100
Walk

538
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,840
For example, like here, below one or two, it is judged as 60

539
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,340
This spanking only costs 60

540
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,340
But if you are 42 to 50 taels

541
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,140
In addition to playing version 68, you

542
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,540
You have another year in prison

543
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,940
going to prison for one year

544
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,340
a year in prison

545
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,040
If you are 82 to 90 taels

546
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,640
You don't need to fight 100

547
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,340
you will be in prison for three years

548
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,940
If it is 92 to 100 taels

549
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,340
you still have to stay

550
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,640
Except battle 100

551
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,340
you want to be popular

552
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,680
to distribute frontier

553
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,680
To reserve two thousand miles

554
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,480
So wait until 120 taels or more

555
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,140
will pay the back

556
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,680
This sentence is based on the value of the amount you steal

557
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,180
I think the sentencing decider is very interesting

558
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,340
If our current law

559
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,240
If such a sentence is used for a fraud case

560
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,580
most scammers

561
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,140
probably to death

562
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,680
good

563
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,580
Then in addition to the mother law

564
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,780
law enforcement

565
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,780
There are also some changes

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
And the new crime situations they're adapting to

567
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,800
Especially the tired meal is too much

568
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,400
So everyone wants to define these tired meals

569
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
So give it a name called chicken foot slippery

570
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
And find a way to prevent these tired meals from happening

571
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So at that time, a kind of criminal law was invented in many places

572
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,200
It's called Iron Cover Iron Lock Strap

573
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,000
that is to say with a hardcore

574
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,600
Then there must be an iron strap to lock it to the foot

575
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,200
or locked in the neck

576
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Let it be carried like this

577
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,600
avoid it later

578
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,200
do the theft again

579
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,400
But later we'll just look at an image and find out

580
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
even though it already has this thing

581
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,200
still commit crimes

582
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,200
In addition, it also mentioned that there is a principle

583
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Just to increase the punishment

584
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,400
That is, there was violence during the theft.

585
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,200
The crime of murder with a gray knife is aggravated

586
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Other crimes in certain places with special status

587
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,800
will also increase the penalty

588
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,200
Those special status fields

589
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Status and place are usually related to the official or royal family

590
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,800
So if you committed a crime in a royal or official place

591
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,200
you will pretend to be criminal

592
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,400
There is another very interesting phenomenon

593
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
But China's special situation

594
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
This is still the case in the Republic of China

595
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
crimes against relatives

596
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It is very special except criminal law

597
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
because of family crimes

598
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
it is based on your kinship to convict

599
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,000
So when you especially immediate family members

600
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Its crimes, its convictions are very light

601
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
not even guilty

602
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Until now, in the Constitution of the Republic of China

603
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
sin of theft

604
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
If the son steals the books from the father's immediate family members

605
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's not a crime

606
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
This is a very interesting penal code

607
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
until now

608
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
In addition, of course, the type of dirt is also related to criminal responsibility.

609
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That is, you stole the dirt

610
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
If it is public dirt

611
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It's official dirt

612
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
The penalty is even heavier

613
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
In addition, if you are involved in a crime

614
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
In addition to the so-called master-slave

615
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
If you are a criminal harboring

616
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Or you are accepting his stamp

617
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
there are penalties

618
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
In addition, the official duties must also be mature.

619
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
If you are an official or a patch

620
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
none of you

621
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Didn't catch the thief

622
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Even if he was not caught, there is a law to accept responsibility.

623
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Then obviously we can see the laws of the Qing Dynasty

624
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
He's not actually a piece of iron

625
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He will actually adapt to the changes in the whole society

626
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Also some new updates

627
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And these laws and forces are constantly changing

628
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
so these criminals

629
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
In the law of these congratulatory crimes

630
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
In fact, the rules are quite detailed

631
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Then use this method to congratulate the Lord for committing a crime

632
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Let's see next

633
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If a crime has occurred

634
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
how does he report the crime

635
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
how to deal with these

636
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
How does the government handle these processes

637
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
when the crime first occurred

638
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
ordinary people

639
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Maybe he didn't report to the police right away first.

640
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He first went to the neighborhood near his house

641
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
so-called group training

642
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,400
or Baojiachang

643
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,600
He first talked with Tuan Lian and Bao Jia Chang

644
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
He said so-and-so's house stole something from him

645
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,100
It's time for group training

646
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,600
With this Baojia chief, the two trillion

647
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,100
to this place for mediation

648
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,600
Much like our mediation committee now

649
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,100
Let's mediate first

650
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,600
If mediation fails

651
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,400
In the end they will sue

652
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,300
Then after suing the officer

653
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,200
will present his son

654
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
or pie

655
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,900
Say so and so or when in Zhuangzi

656
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,300
my house was stolen

657
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,500
or when so and so stole from me

658
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,600
what did you steal

659
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,900
I will list the so-called Shi Dan

660
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,400
In Shidan, it will be listed as

661
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,100
something was stolen from my house

662
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,700
list them one by one

663
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
even put his this

664
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,700
The price of this item will also be listed

665
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
then this time

666
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,200
After the branch accepts the report

667
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
Then he started investigating

668
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
First of all, he will shoot calligraphy

669
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,500
to that scene

670
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,060
do something called this

671
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,000
CSI crime scene to do some investigation

672
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,880
An investigative report written after the crime scene investigation

673
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,840
call bulletin

674
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,340
This is the bulletin left at that time

675
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,580
This bulletin is written very carefully

676
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,700
They said this man, Yu Fuxing, had his home burglarized

677
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,080
where does he live

678
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
He lives at the Jiaochangkou of the official temple

679
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,880
His house is a pavement

680
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
is a shop

681
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,380
The distance between pavements is two

682
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,280
There is a cabinet room in front

683
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,580
in front of the counter

684
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,880
There is a tall building in the back

685
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
Then there is a small door on the left side of the wall with a

686
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,720
what's next near the middle

687
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,620
He also said that there was a piece of bamboo on his wall

688
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
but he is renovating

689
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,620
So when he is on the street next to the outside

690
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:49,120
The walls of the refurbished bamboo pieces have no cement on the lake

691
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,120
So he said there were thieves at that time

692
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,620
the empty house next door to him

693
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,120
ran from his empty house to his house

694
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,360
and then stole something

695
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,600
He said the last book meaning, I found out from the investigation

696
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,600
This crossing is indeed a crossing.

697
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,000
How much does it measure? 20 1 inches wide and 1 15 inches wide

698
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,300
Such this wall was found with damaged heart muscle

699
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,600
So he will do a survey like this

700
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,800
What about sometimes, the Shuyi Association said in a survey

701
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,100
They found the scene, with the informant

702
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,300
Reporter's description must not match

703
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,900
Then the branch will start to suspect that this may be a case of false reporting.

704
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,300
there will be such a judgment

705
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,500
Well, if it is determined that he is indeed a case,

706
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,700
Calligraphy will start, and this branch line will send an official document to guess the ticket

707
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,500
Ask that man to start to mend, and then start to catch the bandit according to the plan

708
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
catch the thief

709
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,900
Then if this supplement catches the thief

710
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,000
he'll subpoena the victim

711
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
and general

712
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,120
A dry line of witnesses begins the interrogation

713
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,620
Then the official document of these summons is called Peteran

714
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,720
Then after the arraignment they said

715
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,620
Each will have their own job status and confession

716
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,320
how was that day

717
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,820
why am i

718
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,720
These final confessions are left behind and are called work certificates.

719
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,320
In the end, of course, the case was closed.

720
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,880
we used to watch this tv

721
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,160
there will be pressure

722
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,460
The pressure of the painting is a knot

723
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,820
The whole process looks like this

724
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,980
But in fact we will find

725
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,980
Most of the cases are basically unsolved

726
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,640
because most of the theft cases

727
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Very low detection rate

728
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
so let's see

729
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,340
now probably theft

730
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,240
For example, in Taipei now

731
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,440
In terms of the police capacity of Taipei City

732
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,240
Theft cases probably have a detection rate of 80 or 90%.

733
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,020
80, 90% or more

734
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,480
Plus this monitor that we have installed for the last time

735
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,780
So in fact, the detection rate of this kind of theft is quite high.

736
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
But in traditional things, it's actually not too high

737
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,200
There was a missionary

738
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:06,900
called Morrison

739
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,200
he had been to 1894

740
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,400
have been to chongqing

741
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,200
But he spoke highly of the public security in Chongqing.

742
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,200
He said that the law and order in Chongqing is very good.

743
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:16,900
very good

744
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
But everyone should pay attention

745
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,300
This description is actually a comparison

746
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,500
are compared

747
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,800
In other words, when these Westerners came to China

748
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,300
He said good is not absolutely good

749
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,500
is relatively good

750
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,600
It was also compared to when he was in some cities in Europe

751
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,100
In China, Chongqing is a city with good law and order

752
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,700
what is it actually like

753
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,600
uncertain

754
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,400
Let's follow my statistics

755
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,200
We see cases in the city

756
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,700
What happened in Chongqing at that time

757
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,900
There are more than 1,000 cases in the city

758
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,700
Then

759
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,100
In the end, only 204 suspects were obtained

760
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,200
So he only has a 19% cracking rate.

761
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
country?

762
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,800
His case count is more than 1900

763
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,200
Getting a case to crack is 6

764
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
The true detection rate is 33%.

765
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
In the countryside is better than in the city

766
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
higher detection rate

767
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
but even so

768
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Its average detection rate is only 28%.

769
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So you can say this

770
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Is the detection rate high?

771
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
of course not

772
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
so it's only relatively good

773
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
relatively good

774
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
there is another interesting thing

775
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
is actually

776
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
After many of these suspects were caught,

777
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
put in jail

778
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Most closed for less than a month

779
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
probably hang up

780
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
will die in prison

781
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Then you know that in this prison at that time

782
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
In fact, the conditions are very bad

783
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So a lot of these suspects are in jail

784
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's hard to survive more than a month

785
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Hard to survive more than a month

786
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
ok, let's see

787
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Context affecting crime rates

788
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I use this picture to estimate

789
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
During the gay boom

790
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
This cuts to the number of crimes

791
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
everyone see

792
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
From the first year of being gay to the 13th year of being gay

793
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
its this cut to case number

794
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Very interesting

795
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
There is an interesting phenomenon in this figure

796
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That is to say

797
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Comrades from the first year to the sixth year

798
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,640
His theft cases are very high

799
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,440
But after seven years of gay

800
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
slowly lowered

801
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,640
lowered a lot

802
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,640
then this time

803
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,800
why during this time

804
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,900
why is his case high

805
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,640
In fact, if we take a closer look

806
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,540
In the historical background of the time

807
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,440
You will find at least a few reasons

808
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,640
is responsible for the growth of this cutter case

809
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,000
and also directly reflected in the

810
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,440
Inside the case of the cutter case

811
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,000
For example, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

812
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,640
Everyone knows the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

813
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,080
In fact, the first year of comrades is already the end of the strong humiliation

814
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,440
But there was their

815
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,400
To Wing King Ten Open

816
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,080
He entered Chongqing in the first year of comrades

817
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,800
into Sichuan Province

818
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,600
harassed the harassed

819
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,280
He entered Sichuan Province from here

820
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,400
Then he went to Guizhou

821
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,800
Then in the second year of comrades

822
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
He's here again from

823
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
Arrived in Sichuan again

824
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
Finally annihilated in this place

825
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,400
But in the process of his arrival in Sichuan

826
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
No direct access to Chongqing

827
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
But I have entered the surrounding areas of Chongqing

828
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That is, around Baxin

829
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So at that time many cases

830
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
cut into the case

831
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It is said that many victims are group trainers

832
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Why did team training suffer?

833
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Because of the group practice, he has to go to many arts outlets

834
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
to guard against these Taipings

835
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But there is no one in his family

836
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So the house becomes

837
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Good example of a break-in

838
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So a lot of team practice to defend Yikou

839
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
When he came back, he found that his house had been burglarized.

840
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
a lot of it is because

841
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
many of these victims

842
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's because of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom

843
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
indirect damage

844
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
What does the second reason have to do with it?

845
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Happened with comrades for two years

846
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The lesson plans in Chongqing are related

847
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
The Comrade Two Years Happened in Chongqing

848
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Anti-Catholic Teaching Plan

849
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
At that time, many groups of mobs

850
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Just run to Catholics

851
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
These residential areas go down

852
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
to rob, to burn

853
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,300
There are also many people taking advantage of this time

854
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,860
to name the thing that was stolen from that residence

855
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,680
After those people who stole were slowly caught

856
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,220
they tell their reasons

857
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,880
It was when I was gay for two years

858
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,040
I'm taking advantage of the chaos

859
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,840
Seeing this, I just touched something and came back

860
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,880
So in fact this turmoil

861
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,480
Endemic unrest can also affect cheetao cases

862
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,780
Then the third reason is related to the price

863
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,580
related to this economic change

864
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,380
Because in the three years of many comrades

865
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,460
a lot of these thieves got caught

866
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,020
His statement said

867
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,320
Why did I steal that year

868
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,880
Because he said that the price of rice was too expensive that year

869
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,180
It's too high for me to live

870
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,980
so now i have to steal

871
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,020
Is it like this let's see

872
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,560
Actually this is what I got from

873
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,100
inside the file

874
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,400
a price list

875
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,960
We will find that in 1864 when

876
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,000
The price of rice has suddenly risen

877
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,060
and increased several times

878
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,340
The highest rice price is from 2 taels

879
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,840
Rise to 3.5 Taels

880
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,300
It's going to be high

881
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,300
The same is true for the lowest rice price

882
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,000
So in the third year of Tongzhi

883
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,300
Because of the sudden rise in the price of rice

884
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,000
At that time, there were many people because of the high price of rice

885
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,500
he ended up having trouble living

886
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
end up stealing

887
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
The fourth reason is a long-term factor

888
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,000
Long-term factors have a lot to do with urbanization

889
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Why? This is a statistic I made

890
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,500
The urban population of this eighth-tier region

891
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,000
This is his total population

892
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Let's figure out the percentage of urbanization in his city

893
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
As you can see in 1824

894
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,500
The proportion of urbanization is 14%

895
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
This is probably the traditional Chinese period

896
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,500
average proportion of urbanization in general

897
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
about ten percent

898
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
But by the 1860s

899
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
That's when it's good to have the same government

900
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,500
His urbanization ratio suddenly rose to 32%

901
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
this city

902
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Chongqing city developed in private land

903
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
He changed from a population of tens of thousands

904
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Population from 65,000 to 200,000

905
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,960
The degree of urbanization suddenly increased at this time

906
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,460
Then continue to grow slowly and continuously

907
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,700
So at this time we will find

908
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,540
If we compare the 18th century to the mid-19th century

909
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,620
You can find an interesting phenomenon

910
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,540
In the second half of the 18th century during the Qianlong Dynasty

911
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,420
His theft case is actually not too many

912
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,760
Only more than 300 pieces

913
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,700
Then the proportion that happens in the city is 19%

914
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,860
Occurred in rural areas is 81%

915
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,620
So most of the cases are in rural areas

916
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,280
But in Tong Zhichao's 3,000-plus theft cases,

917
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,080
The proportion of cities takes place in cities as high as 33%

918
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,460
The proportion that occurred in rural areas has dropped to 59%

919
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,280
So this whole trend is related to urbanization

920
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,040
So urbanization will actually affect the growth of the crime rate

921
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,720
Especially in the urban crime growth

922
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,080
this is a situation

923
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,840
Okay, the next question is fun.

924
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,280
What kind of person is likely to become a thief

925
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,940
What kind of person is prone to crime

926
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,400
Generally we think that

927
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,360
Especially the so-called fringe people who don't do their jobs properly

928
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,400
a so-called dangerous class

929
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,480
Including things like implement, beggar

930
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,960
No business, or some thieves

931
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,840
Hooligans, liars

932
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,840
OK, but I'm based on myself from this cutter case

933
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,680
Tong Zhichao's case made some statistics

934
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,360
The number of these people is certainly not small.

935
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,640
But the real, the real majority is this group of people

936
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,400
Xia Li is alive

937
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,280
they are working class

938
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,400
But the fluid working class

939
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:43,600
He is not the same as the sailor on the ship and the porter

940
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,680
Because sailors and porters are regular occupations

941
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,160
they have trade unions

942
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,960
they have fixed groups

943
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,680
But this Xia Li is not a fixed industry group

944
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,920
So this group of people is the group of people who are most prone to stealing.

945
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
steal a bunch of people

946
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,500
but except for these people

947
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,000
Except in more than 200 months

948
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
More than 200 Summer Law live outside

949
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,500
everyone can see

950
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,000
There are so many businessmen

951
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,500
There are more than 100 people employed in the service industry

952
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,000
civil servant or gene

953
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
He himself may be a thief

954
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,500
We have some social relations

955
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
so this lets us

956
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
thought of another interesting thing

957
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
would be a thief

958
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,000
Not necessarily all directly related to poverty

959
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,500
Because some people are professional

960
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
also have income

961
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
but they steal

962
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,000
so what's the reason

963
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Next we discuss

964
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,500
question of motive

965
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,000
The question of motive for theft

966
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Do the poor always steal?

967
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,500
that's right

968
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
they may be inclined to steal

969
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
but not all

970
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
poor people steal

971
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
And why the poor steal

972
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,000
there are many promotions

973
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,500
the reason it becomes a thief

974
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,000
and motivation

975
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Next we start with

976
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,500
From the vantage point

977
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
especially through

978
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,500
The mouths of these criminals in the file

979
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,500
Everyone states that they are so-called criminals

980
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
look at his criminal motives

981
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Then we will put some theories of this criminology

982
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
time to analyze the motives of these crimes

983
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,000
you'll discover the theory of criminology

984
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
very effective in explaining the causes of crime in history

985
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
First of all, there is a bias in criminology

986
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,500
rational choice theory

987
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,500
That is to say, when ordinary people commit crimes

988
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
feel like I'm stealing

989
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
The result will be better than my

990
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Now my situation is much better

991
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,500
I choose to steal

992
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
This situation is used to explain

993
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Like Xia Li, a living poor person

994
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Why would they choose to steal

995
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,500
That's because they judged that the times they lived in were not good

996
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
if we steal

997
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
can make my life a little better

998
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
This is called rational choice theory

999
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,500
But then there is another problem

1000
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
We will find a very interesting situation

1001
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,500
when many poor people are stealing

1002
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
he didn't steal alone

1003
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
he is a group host

1004
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Kind of like a crime syndicate stealing

1005
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
this is fun

1006
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
we actually see a lot

1007
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Confessions stolen by eighth-line party members

1008
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Director Zhang San Wang Ermazi

1009
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
they are poor

1010
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
One day in the ruined temple

1011
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
suddenly everyone gathers together

1012
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Discuss that everyone's life is so sad

1013
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Why don't we work together

1014
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
to steal

1015
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And they'll all have a plan to steal

1016
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Which family has silver at home?

1017
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
So this according to social psychology

1018
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
social aggregation theory

1019
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That is to say

1020
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
when people are single

1021
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
your criminal

1022
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
not so bold

1023
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
But when you become a group of people

1024
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
you are getting bolder

1025
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
courage is getting bigger and bigger

1026
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
social aggregation theory

1027
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The third one we talked about

1028
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
except the poor steal

1029
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
some people are poor

1030
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
some people have careers

1031
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
but why would he steal

1032
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
is related to the third

1033
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,880
the theory of criminology

1034
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,560
everyday life theory

1035
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,080
This theory of everyday life which states that

1036
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,920
especially theft

1037
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,920
Continue to have three elements

1038
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,360
The first element, of course, is

1039
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,880
criminally inclined thief

1040
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,840
the second

1041
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,200
you must have a goal

1042
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,760
valuable stolen item

1043
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,120
the subject matter

1044
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,880
The third element is to have

1045
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,720
In the absence of supervisors

1046
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,440
That is to say, the combination of these three reasons

1047
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,760
crime will happen

1048
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,680
you have criminal tendencies today

1049
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,040
you saw a valuable phone

1050
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,320
Then there was no one around

1051
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,360
no one nor monitor

1052
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,760
next thing you want to say

1053
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,600
This is a gift from God

1054
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
take it now

1055
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,840
let me steal

1056
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,840
So this so-called opportunism

1057
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,400
the theory of everyday life

1058
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,280
So we actually often see

1059
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,920
a lot of thieves are like this

1060
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,000
special we iron tail says

1061
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,840
will mention cattle stealing

1062
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,560
Many people because of rural people

1063
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,600
After grazing the cattle, they put them in the countryside

1064
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,960
sometimes there are people

1065
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,200
it ain't no work

1066
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,300
it ain't without a job

1067
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,400
it's not without income

1068
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,800
But when it passed the paddy field

1069
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,000
see the cow over there

1070
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,200
no more manpower

1071
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
And at this time feel

1072
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Just let me take the bull by the hand

1073
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,300
just took it away

1074
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,300
In fact, there are many such cases

1075
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,700
There are many cases of this

1076
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,100
I just saw it walking in the shops in this city

1077
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,400
Found the shop door open

1078
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
in stock

1079
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
but no one is watching

1080
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,900
It goes in and steals

1081
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,500
So the situation is

1082
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,800
This can explain the third

1083
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,600
But the fourth one is fun

1084
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,600
I want to explain

1085
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,200
The fourth is to use this criminological theory

1086
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,000
Called Situational Prevention Traveler Inside

1087
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,600
He mentioned that many criminals

1088
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,200
He is in a situation

1089
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,000
in everyday situations

1090
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,700
Some are criminal motives

1091
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,300
especially if they are likely to be related by blood

1092
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,000
with geographical or business relationship

1093
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,600
as long as under the circumstances

1094
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,900
a little chance

1095
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,400
is likely to encourage it to steal

1096
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,500
In terms of blood relationship

1097
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,300
The most common is that the son steals the father's money

1098
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,100
Geographical relations are neighbors

1099
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,200
Stealing a neighbor's money

1100
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,200
employee relations is

1101
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Hired worker stealing from boss

1102
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,400
This is a situation caused by a situation

1103
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,600
so this i say

1104
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,400
Why

1105
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,200
Spit gun is not necessarily

1106
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,800
No money

1107
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,600
Maybe he has a business

1108
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,000
rich income

1109
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
But it's possible to commit a crime

1110
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,000
that is

1111
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,400
this little house

1112
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,900
At that time, this stupid thief stole the root

1113
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,000
Because he sees if anyone is watching

1114
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,200
He secretly went to the city to sell

1115
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,700
I probably know that the reason is so big once

1116
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,100
Calibration is so large

1117
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,500
So many people said

1118
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,200
would rather steal a sheep

1119
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,800
don't steal a sheep

1120
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,400
Next we look at this

1121
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Types of crime and the process of crime

1122
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
Generally we

1123
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,000
we say

1124
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,700
like a beautiful one

1125
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,200
Bird tree for the enjoyment of skills

1126
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,600
we might think

1127
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Wang Yi said

1128
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,800
This kind of nonsense

1129
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,600
pro-communist is very good

1130
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,400
this non

1131
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,900
is crime the norm

1132
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,500
so many crimes

1133
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,120
will be higher

1134
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,880
After these were stolen

1135
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Are they avenues with or without disassembly

1136
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,080
And are there some black hands behind them?

1137
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,600
Well in fact

1138
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
We actually see

1139
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,120
Most of these fly the above

1140
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,480
In fact, not everyone knows

1141
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,600
It's not that hard to clean up

1142
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,720
everyone practiced

1143
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,040
Not every kid has a cleaner

1144
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,640
then most often as a form of stealing

1145
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,320
is the so-called road pattern

1146
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,560
And the most commonly used way to find the image is

1147
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,360
move the walls away

1148
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,120
That's what we see in this painting

1149
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,440
just inside the wall

1150
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,840
this is the most common

1151
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,840
In addition, theft is also common

1152
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,840
There is another way we think

1153
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,200
only now

1154
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,080
In fact, there were gold plates in ancient times.

1155
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,240
Just use our famous cigarettes

1156
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,760
That famous drug comes in the name of someone's theft

1157
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,360
In fact, this can only appear in the bottom line

1158
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,360
Another thing is stealing

1159
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,560
It's the common practice of stealing things

1160
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,000
But the most common one is actually road image

1161
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,500
next might be interesting

1162
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:09,300
Hot funds that can be stolen many times

1163
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,500
Usually it is the test base

1164
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,800
Exam period

1165
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,300
And when the market is open

1166
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,700
Another one is when the wedding is followed.

1167
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,400
This situation is actually at the meeting room

1168
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,300
Because many times the wedding photos are stolen

1169
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,500
In addition, when these thieves are arrogant, how can they be arrogant?

1170
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,800
Knots as part of more experienced thieves

1171
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,800
They will analyze the things that steal drugs to be arrogant

1172
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,300
He won't be arrogant all the time

1173
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,600
Because he knows that the goal of being arrogant all the time is too low-level

1174
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,600
So where could he be arrogant?

1175
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,600
He may go to the pawnshop to be a pawn

1176
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,900
He may go to the market and set up a stall in those markets to sell directly

1177
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,500
he may also sell directly to the checkout

1178
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,600
said to take care of

1179
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,500
Then let's look at

1180
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,800
Is there a so-called black hand behind the scenes?

1181
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,000
It was called my home in the post office at that time

1182
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,400
The explanation is called Wojia

1183
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,860
And these nests usually open inns

1184
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,160
open an inn

1185
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,800
So those officials feel

1186
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,800
The best way to develop this nest

1187
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,800
Even Baojia and the law

1188
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,400
Use this method to lift up these innkeepers

1189
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,800
because of their

1190
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,200
You see, the inn is also an inn

1191
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,800
is big or small

1192
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,100
If you use the law to make an appointment with Baojia

1193
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,200
The so-called opening an inn and becoming a home

1194
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,900
This is an important crime prevention method

1195
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,900
ok so next question

1196
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,400
what kind of person is easy to be stolen

1197
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,100
Do you think rich people are easy to be stolen?

1198
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,300
actually not

1199
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,200
actually not

1200
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,700
our current statistics

1201
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,200
This is my statistic from the answer

1202
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,400
You can know

1203
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,300
Most of the stolen ones were merchants

1204
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,200
In fact, generations of scientists

1205
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,700
and some workers

1206
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
In fact, those who are really rich in this so-called co-existing drama

1207
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,440
In fact, it adds up to less votes

1208
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,080
So we say that most people will be voted

1209
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,320
They're all so-called middle-class families.

1210
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,680
or Chinese House

1211
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,360
So how many people are there in Chinese House and Chinese House?

1212
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,960
According to the status at that time, there were probably more than 100 taels

1213
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,680
how much is it

1214
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,920
Not more than 100 taels

1215
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,840
And then less than 1000 taels of such a moment

1216
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,840
so-called middle-class home

1217
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,560
Then if you have more than 1000 taels

1218
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,160
was recognized at that time

1219
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,880
1000 taels are responsible

1220
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,720
So let's look at the voted

1221
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,360
Probably Chinese House

1222
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,520
In fact, when the democrats

1223
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,520
At that time, many people already realized that

1224
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,360
So many opinions say

1225
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,800
When the bandits come

1226
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,600
The most vulnerable is the so-called Chinese House

1227
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,400
Then these Chinese homes

1228
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,920
Will they choose to report to the police?

1229
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
In fact, in traditional Chinese

1230
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,700
There are also many people who say that the reporter

1231
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,540
become a black art

1232
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,800
So the criminal's black art is in some

1233
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,000
market appears

1234
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,500
And there are many

1235
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,200
So these things I said today

1236
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,500
Actually true is not really the number of possible

1237
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,500
much higher than these

1238
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,300
Then why did they report to the police?

1239
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,700
There are also several reasons

1240
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,400
Sometimes because of the pulled

1241
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,700
actually every time

1242
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,700
we see actual cases

1243
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,500
Every time it is pulled

1244
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,200
The value of that thing is actually not that high

1245
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,700
except for a few

1246
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,800
It will exceed dozens of taels of silver

1247
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,000
or this for up to a hundred people

1248
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,800
Most of the silver

1249
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,500
Most of these silver taels that were pulled

1250
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,900
They are actually only one tael or two taels of silver

1251
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,300
Then for the middle class data

1252
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,900
Actually such value

1253
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,800
such this

1254
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,700
such a price

1255
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,200
or such a value

1256
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,700
It's actually not that big of a loss.

1257
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,400
So usually they may choose to report to the official

1258
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,600
depends on them

1259
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,760
The reason for their customs declaration this time is because

1260
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,800
sometimes at the end of sleep

1261
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,860
winter time

1262
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,200
Because the government is at the end of his sleep

1263
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,100
He does not accept reports

1264
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,520
so even if it happens

1265
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,800
You went to report the crime and he didn't accept it.

1266
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,820
So sometimes many cases

1267
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,820
In fact, at the end of sleep

1268
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:19,600
He actually became a criminal melanin

1269
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,860
Another possibility is

1270
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,320
in the process of reporting

1271
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,700
many victims he felt

1272
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,720
his risk is higher

1273
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,400
because no matter from the countryside

1274
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,560
or to the city's platform

1275
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,560
in the countryside

1276
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,660
sometimes you take a long time

1277
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,820
get the door now

1278
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,020
In the middle, there are actually considerable risks

1279
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,120
And it costs a lot

1280
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,820
Not necessarily after customs declaration

1281
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,060
you can really get it back

1282
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,120
with the original header item

1283
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,620
Therefore, many people think that it is not a declaration

1284
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:53,360
This is the cause of many criminal melanin administration

1285
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,700
Plus everyone knows

1286
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,860
I also analyzed earlier

1287
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,520
Only a 28% detection rate

1288
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,200
think about it

1289
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
You are the master of ten, so your case has been dragged by this extreme tree

1290
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:09,700
Then your family lives far away from Xinshan, Xinshan

1291
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,640
Think about it, forget it, the reporting officer may not have actually done a case

1292
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,200
So most of them will probably choose the reporting officer

1293
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,040
what are we going to see next

1294
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,700
Thieves love to drag

1295
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,000
A few days ago I was talking to an Israeli friend about this time

1296
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,740
I guessed with him, saying that he is doing Buddhism

1297
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,240
I said you guess

1298
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,240
what is most often dragged

1299
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,900
And the jewelry, right?

1300
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,240
I said no

1301
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,740
I said cows, I said cows, there are many cows, but not the most

1302
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,000
but he said what is it

1303
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,100
I said that the person who is most often dragged is

1304
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,800
clothes, clothes are the most often dragged

1305
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,200
Then this clothes being dragged is not a Chinese characteristic

1306
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,700
It's the same in Europe

1307
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,700
Clothes were the most frequently dragged in Britain and France in early modern Europe

1308
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,960
so why are the clothes dragged

1309
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,260
The most common passive is actually related to consumption

1310
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,720
In fact, this East and West in the early modern

1311
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,060
fashion of things

1312
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,500
especially consumer clothes

1313
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
One more form of fashion

1314
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,220
So many people steal clothes and sell them better

1315
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,300
Because the most people want it

1316
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,600
So why should we talk about a US-Taiwan

1317
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,000
Run to New York Road to steal clothes

1318
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,800
from a

1319
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,700
That's because it's so good at cooking

1320
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,300
and very nice

1321
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,500
Actually operating gas

1322
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,100
like camp

1323
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,300
camp meals these snacks

1324
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,800
very easy to burn

1325
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,700
easy to steal

1326
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,700
In addition, daily necessities

1327
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,300
originally deep class

1328
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,300
Like cows, chickens, ducks and other deep species

1329
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,500
in the eighteenth century in the former east

1330
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,700
The ratio of being stolen is quite high.

1331
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,260
But in the nineteenth century

1332
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,400
The proportions stolen from these depths of agriculture

1333
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,100
lower a lot

1334
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,700
because the reason is very simple

1335
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,400
because rich people

1336
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,400
people with money

1337
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Can not be regarded as concentrated in the city

1338
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,800
So most thieves start asking for

1339
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
if he chooses to spit

1340
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,300
He will choose something that is easier to carry and more valuable

1341
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,300
Most of those are in the city

1342
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,000
Then I said just now that when I reported the crime

1343
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,700
He'll make a poem list of what he's ripping

1344
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,700
This is one of the poetry lists at that time

1345
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,500
He'll say what he tore up for himself

1346
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,000
You still have to pretend that there are a lot of Chinese words written in the city

1347
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And Xiaoyi

1348
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
and hat

1349
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
In fact, sheep shops in the clothing category are the most frequently listed

1350
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It's the most frequent thief on this cruise.

1351
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
There is also this horse maniac below

1352
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and cloth

1353
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
These can't be seen

1354
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
There are also casual men

1355
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So we can see here

1356
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
This is when these clothes

1357
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
why everyday language is so good

1358
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
There are actually a lot of sheep shops in there.

1359
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
For example, these sheep shops

1360
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
The things on the shoulders are some sheep shop

1361
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You can see this sheep shop here

1362
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
in the wild

1363
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,560
In China, it is actually very immortal

1364
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,640
There's actually something in there

1365
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,840
i didn't list it

1366
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,840
especially some cultural goods

1367
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,760
cultural goods

1368
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,260
Don't talk about Yantai

1369
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,260
And very high-grade wood

1370
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,260
and Shuhua

1371
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,760
These things are actually found inside

1372
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,760
But from inside we can see these cultural goods

1373
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,760
is a drifter

1374
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,760
It's the benefactor

1375
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:27,260
In fact, it doesn't have to be a senior official.

1376
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:32,260
But it's definitely something called citizenship

1377
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,260
So these cultural goods

1378
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,260
In fact, these people

1379
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,260
A symbolic way of wanting to follow its identity and taste

1380
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,260
these problems are there

1381
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,260
but which are the richest

1382
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,260
stolen richest

1383
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,260
actually an official

1384
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,260
Because for the top consumption

1385
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,260
This tradition is really consuming top things

1386
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,260
is advanced

1387
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,260
So we see a max coffee steal

1388
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,260
It's actually a matter of design

1389
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,900
ok , so let ' s take another look at the cities

1390
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,800
We're discussing the biggest relationship this crime firm has with the city.

1391
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,800
It's about discussing which places are most prone to crime

1392
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,100
These so-called crime hotspots, crime problems

1393
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,900
I have a friend who studies Shanghai

1394
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,600
He studied Shanghai's Little Britain period through

1395
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,900
He found that, crawling hands, the most common case of crawling hands

1396
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,300
all concentrated at the intersection of the road

1397
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,200
ok , that ' s a road cross

1398
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,200
Like running away after stealing something

1399
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,900
Because he has many routes to choose from

1400
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,400
less easy to catch

1401
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Let's take a look at this and see that the case happened in a traditional city.

1402
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,600
What areas can everyone enter

1403
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,200
Of course I didn't study as detailed as my friend

1404
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,400
Then I use this picture of Chongqing

1405
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,900
This is the city map of Chongqing in the Qing Dynasty at that time

1406
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,000
Then we update this to get Chongqing

1407
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
At that time, his in various regions

1408
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
access his function

1409
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,400
like this block in blue

1410
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,800
is the business district

1411
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,600
red block

1412
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,000
is the administrative area

1413
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
like this block is the parish

1414
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So we just had a little talk with God

1415
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,400
The place between these temples

1416
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,800
this is the transport zone

1417
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,200
because there are many piers

1418
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,400
this is the transport zone

1419
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,400
Then this is the so-called stone pipe

1420
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,000
because later this

1421
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
After the opening of the five-port trade

1422
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,600
There are a lot of places between the stone pipes

1423
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,000
then let's see

1424
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
next picture

1425
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,400
This picture is to see this cut to the case

1426
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,800
Which spaces are the longest among them

1427
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,000
we see the darkest

1428
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,200
more than fifty

1429
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,000
Orthodox and Orthodox and Orthodox

1430
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
But these two areas

1431
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,600
In fact, it is a business district and an administrative district.

1432
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,800
So in traditional cities

1433
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,400
Cut to the longest of the cases

1434
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,000
Is in the business district and administrative district

1435
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
this is the case

1436
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,780
I think when going to the end

1437
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,780
i want to discuss

1438
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,360
In the Qing Dynasty, the way of cutting

1439
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,860
how does it work

1440
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:18,060
We can use this criminology master He

1441
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,700
Talk about discussing three criteria to see the situation at that time

1442
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,700
This is called the relationship of principle

1443
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,940
that is to say in the city

1444
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,100
way cities when these cut categories

1445
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:34,600
Its laws, the rule of law, are strict enough

1446
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,100
In fact, through the previous discussion, we

1447
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,300
already visible

1448
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,000
Actually, I think it's something that can't be said

1449
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,100
Yeah

1450
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,100
Yeah

1451
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:44,600
right

1452
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,100
sound is great

1453
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,700
so i think there is also

1454
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,500
I think in terms of severity

1455
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,600
We can see the green beauty in the Qing Dynasty

1456
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,600
Whether it is green or beautiful

1457
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,360
Luli is also good

1458
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,360
In fact, the specification for cutting

1459
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,360
and come true are very subtle

1460
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
So in terms of severity

1461
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
OK, he has such an effect

1462
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
But then the swiftness

1463
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
what is rapidity

1464
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
In modern terms, it is called quick trial and quick decision

1465
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Which means after today's crime

1466
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
you caught the criminal

1467
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Is it going to be a quick trial?

1468
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
But we see a lot of these suspects get caught

1469
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
In fact, your case still can't be used later.

1470
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Why? Because many cases are in the process of expedited trial and trial

1471
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
took a long time

1472
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Sometimes these cuts to the suspect

1473
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
After being caught, he said that he had an accomplice

1474
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Then we can't catch those accomplices anyway

1475
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I feel like this case has been extended and there is no way to solve it.

1476
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So there is a little bit of a problem in terms of speed.

1477
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
As for what this certainty refers to

1478
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
that is to say a criminal

1479
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
When a crime can be sure soon

1480
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
suffered rumors

1481
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
this punishment

1482
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,960
But we also saw earlier

1483
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,860
In fact, to be honest

1484
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,300
So its detection rate is 28 percent

1485
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,300
That is to say, more than 80% of people who commit crimes cannot be caught.

1486
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,200
it can escape

1487
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,800
it can get away with it

1488
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,600
Then from this certainty, it is not enough

1489
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,500
So from this point of view

1490
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,300
The Qing Dynasty as a whole was at least sustaining its own business

1491
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,800
it's in the punitive crime

1492
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,600
even though it has strict regulations

1493
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,000
But it can't tell the truth

1494
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,400
Its detection rate is also very limited

1495
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,300
So take the protection of China

1496
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,300
So-called local law cannot be enforced

1497
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,500
you continue to have the law

1498
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,800
You can't really have these mechanisms related to the housing market

1499
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,800
Such a law is still empty

1500
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,000
no way housing market true crime

1501
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:52,500
That's what I'm going to do for you today

1502
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,000
Welcome everyone to listen to advice

1503
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,200
thank you all

1504
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I think when everyone heard this story just now, it was very vivid and interesting.

1505
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I think we, the audience, have questions. If you ask questions, welcome to ask them at this time.

1506
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Does anyone want to ask some further questions?

1507
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
well, this gentleman is at the end

1508
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Okay, I’m sorry, that’s what I just wanted to do in the process

1509
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
That is to say, there are some disruptions in the market or the situation that the teacher just mentioned is early and strong.

1510
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Is that the markets in various cities during the climax just now?

1511
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Does their house look like a phenomenon?

1512
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Thanks

1513
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
"Cao Chao Traveler"

1514
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
The villain is called Weasley Slatto

1515
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And there's a scene in it that's Wesley Slaytoo

1516
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
when he arrives in the future

1517
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
He wants to test the power of future police policing

1518
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
He saw a car on the street

1519
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
He knocked on that car window

1520
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
He figured he had the police coming

1521
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
After a long time, the police still haven't come

1522
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
He knocks on the second window

1523
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
forget it

1524
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
not yet

1525
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
He said he was too good

1526
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,760
this is my heaven

1527
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,400
is my crime paradise

1528
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,600
This is actually another crime theory.

1529
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,560
present in the movie

1530
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,260
But I think the broken gut theory makes sense

1531
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,600
But used in the history of Ming and Qing Dynasties

1532
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,660
Especially in terms of the history of the Qing Dynasty

1533
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,100
more difficult to use

1534
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,760
Because to be honest, this gut-breaking theory

1535
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,360
is a very modern theory

1536
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,560
very modern theory

1537
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,220
Especially in modern urbanized buildings

1538
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:31,620
will use

1539
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,960
This traditional Chinese building

1540
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,120
buildings in the city

1541
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,920
Actually window

1542
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,820
There are few windows in the city

1543
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:42,020
because most of the computer

1544
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,160
So the computer arrives this evening

1545
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,060
It's actually made of wood planks to keep the wind up.

1546
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,060
So usually when you go to steal a computer

1547
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,920
you have to use another method

1548
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,720
just put it that

1549
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
this is one way

1550
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
The second way is to climb the wall

1551
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
climb to the second floor of it

1552
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Because the first floor of the traditional Chinese shop

1553
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
it is two layers

1554
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Chinese traditional shop is two floors

1555
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
The first floor is sealed with wooden boards

1556
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
When the official gate is sealed with wooden boards

1557
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But there are windows on the second floor

1558
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
call skylight

1559
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So the second way is you climb the skylight

1560
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Go to the second floor to draw the machine

1561
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
So many shops were stolen

1562
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Usually in addition to being knocked into the pot by the wall

1563
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
is knocking on the door

1564
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Someone climbed to the skylight

1565
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Go in through the skylight on the second floor to smoke something

1566
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So why didn't I use the inside of the broken window

1567
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
The reason is because there is no suitable

1568
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Because there is a more modern version of this objection in the broken window

1569
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
So in the traditional Chinese period

1570
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
There is no way to explain it this way

1571
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Because the traditional Chinese architecture was different at that time

1572
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
so it counts

1573
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
That's it, thank you

1574
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
lady please sit down

1575
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
May I ask, was Xiao Cong a local at that time?

1576
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
ok very good please sit down please sit down

1577
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,000
In fact, I say this, you Chongqing as an example

1578
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
In fact, why is urbanization so serious?

1579
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I would ask why the urbanization is growing so fast in 19

1580
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
In fact, urbanites are not particularly good at living

1581
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
No, urbanites are especially good at giving birth, and there are so many children at once

1582
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,000
In fact, most of them are foreigners who came here to find work and do business.

1583
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So most of them are foreigners

1584
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Well, actually head inside, and then build the hut inside

1585
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
There is quite a field house

1586
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
quite a field

1587
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
The proportion of local discoveries is certainly not low

1588
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But for the first time I said there might be half etiquette too

1589
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,020
Other counties and cities

1590
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,500
I can't count

1591
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,260
Because there was no way to do this statistics at that time.

1592
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,060
but we say for sure

1593
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,060
People from other counties and cities

1594
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,160
As a child's travel port high

1595
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,060
And what?

1596
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,100
i mentioned earlier

1597
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,100
Many were poor when they were young

1598
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,400
then get together

1599
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,060
Everyone started to vote

1600
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:19,700
in that case

1601
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,700
Many of these people are foreigners

1602
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,800
are foreigners

1603
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,060
because of the words of the locals

1604
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,460
he usually doesn't follow

1605
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,360
Not so many people gather together

1606
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,760
usually foreigners

1607
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,760
Find those crackpots and get together over there

1608
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,760
Therefore, the travel port of foreigners is high.

1609
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,520
But this will lead to

1610
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,760
The first is actually something that modern criminology pays great attention to.

1611
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,260
A problem of great concern in criminology

1612
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,520
that is

1613
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,760
Immigration is a disruption of social order

1614
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,760
an important information

1615
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,760
Of course the immigration

1616
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
Comparison is no longer imaging immigrants

1617
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,760
more like immigrant

1618
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,760
Immigrants from other provinces

1619
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,760
but

1620
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
The perspective of traditional officials

1621
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
They do feel that aliens are coming

1622
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
dangerous

1623
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
But they will also know that they can't call out the translator all at once

1624
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Because in fact, many people from other places come to do business

1625
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
or they have a professional job

1626
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
so this

1627
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
So the official

1628
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
one thing they must say

1629
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Chongqing this place

1630
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Wufang Zazu

1631
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
What's the meaning

1632
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's from all over the place

1633
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
So easy to grow and work

1634
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
things are vague

1635
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
mean to say

1636
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Chongqing because many people from other places do business here

1637
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So there are also many big buyers

1638
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
There are quite a few people who come to the world to touch

1639
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Master thinks this means

1640
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
So the father of information or current management

1641
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Actually realize these things

1642
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So we still have to implement

1643
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
who is supporting

1644
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:10,520
So under this circumstance, I can answer you, the proportion of outside points is actually quite high, which is equal to how many times the proportion reaches this time, it is difficult to estimate

1645
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,520
hope to answer you

1646
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:20,520
Thank you, Ms. Bai Yurure, are you familiar with it?

1647
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:25,520
i heard what do you think

1648
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:32,180
What do you think, first in US M crams

1649
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:36,080
In the store, I ask you to search

1650
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,280
output this now'll

1651
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,120
Grab steep C mass ai

1652
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:44,640
Looking at the street will return to the old days

1653
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,760
Could you please check

1654
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,400
The data searched is

1655
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,000
$950

1656
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,560
is $500

1657
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,400
you can search

1658
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,400
search

1659
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,400
you can search

1660
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,900
you can search

1661
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,200
What do you think

1662
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,320
well , actually your question is very meaningful

1663
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,720
very interesting

1664
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,220
But since you ask the question now is the question now

1665
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,920
I put this problem in the Qing Dynasty

1666
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,760
The Qing Dynasty, especially the issue you mentioned later

1667
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,320
In this way, I may not be able to answer your previous questions.

1668
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,600
But the problem behind you is

1669
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,720
For example, now there are many refugees

1670
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,680
he might grab something

1671
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,240
he may not feel that he

1672
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,600
What do you know about Xiao Bingmo

1673
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,720
grab something

1674
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,880
He may not think he is gay

1675
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,240
But it was like this when I was a child

1676
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,480
that there is an objection in tradition

1677
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,840
social objection

1678
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,960
What is social opposition

1679
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,160
so

1680
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,880
in traditional Chinese

1681
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:54,360
Our general family will only go outside the iron

1682
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:56,560
There may be some mountains nearby

1683
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,840
some mountains

1684
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,840
There will be wood down the mountain

1685
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
common people think

1686
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I go to the nearby mountains

1687
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
cut trees, cut moss

1688
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
it's not illegal

1689
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
it's not illegal

1690
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
social crime

1691
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
but

1692
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
in fact not necessarily so

1693
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
because at that time

1694
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
woods on many hills or these

1695
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
it is kind

1696
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
so

1697
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
that's how it's generally said

1698
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
there are many people when

1699
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So in the Qing Dynasty

1700
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Even when it was Trump

1701
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
some people he thinks

1702
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
he took something today

1703
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
i do something

1704
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Does not involve legal same-sex issues

1705
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But legally speaking

1706
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
He's actually gay

1707
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
So that means

1708
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
a matter of habit

1709
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
That is to say, you follow the wind is a habit today

1710
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
he thinks

1711
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
giving some example

1712
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'm following a certain wind habit

1713
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I went through a today

1714
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,000
land

1715
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
see this

1716
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,600
There are apples and orange barrels on the nearby tree

1717
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:35,000
There is a conceptual contradiction

1718
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
some people think it's a habit

1719
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
it does not involve legal issues

1720
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
But legally it's a steal

1721
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It involves you stealing someone's belongings

1722
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
all items

1723
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
There will be such a contradictory character

1724
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Happens in many things whether present or traditional

1725
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
This notion is sometimes

1726
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,200
Some contradictions and overlaps

1727
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,260
so that it will cause

1728
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,760
inside the objection

1729
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,400
The person involved really thinks he is a criminal

1730
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,800
Because he is in his traditional concept

1731
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,300
He thinks his stuff is from himself

1732
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,000
His so-called social crimes

1733
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,400
Then what do you say about this thing?

1734
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,000
For example, I said how to change

1735
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,400
It's actually hard for me to answer Li Zhi's question

1736
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,200
Because this according to historians also

1737
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,200
not a chinese historian

1738
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,000
is a historian of european studies

1739
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
criminal history

1740
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
study this so-called social crime

1741
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,300
He thinks that many behaviors

1742
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,600
Traditionally, it is not a crime

1743
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,000
But because a few rich people

1744
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,400
In order to protect his assets

1745
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,100
He gives power to the law

1746
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,100
make these behaviors

1747
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,900
crimes against the property of vietnamese people

1748
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,300
So the process of law formation

1749
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:06,060
There are a lot of vested interests

1750
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:11,100
or a mechanism set up by the rich to protect himself

1751
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:15,560
Then many ordinary people and their families are easy to offend when they don’t know about it.

1752
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,260
But his own person is not a crime

1753
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:23,400
In terms of European history, there are such studies

1754
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:28,660
However, such research may draw criticism from other scholars.

1755
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:32,560
That is, how do you know the criminals and their confessions

1756
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,260
say we know i thought it was tradition

1757
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,420
This is possible

1758
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:42,060
How can you be sure that the reason these people are giving is not an excuse

1759
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,420
In other words, he deliberately found an excuse

1760
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,020
So he clearly knew it was a crime

1761
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:50,980
he found an excuse

1762
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,860
This is actually a bit like many communication people in China want to steal

1763
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:59,980
He actually stole something he'd been stealing for maybe 50 years

1764
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,760
Might actually ask him how much you stole

1765
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,960
how much did you steal like this

1766
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,520
He just said I stole a little bit

1767
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,260
I stole everything else

1768
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,920
Because he if I come out

1769
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:10,600
he stole it all

1770
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,520
then not the most followed

1771
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:13,420
then he might say

1772
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,560
He also didn't steal it from me

1773
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,320
are stolen

1774
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:17,160
Or I just picked it up

1775
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,800
i don't know what this is

1776
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,400
or some people

1777
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,320
he accepts a dirt

1778
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,800
pick up dirt these people

1779
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:26,800
buy dirt these people

1780
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,960
then he will say

1781
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,680
i didn't know it was dirt

1782
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,160
But I still spent so much money to buy

1783
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:33,720
good

1784
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:35,360
This is my current unit

1785
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,400
How is it usually found that such a situation

1786
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,760
his method of punishment

1787
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,520
In fact it's still too early

1788
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,360
That is to say, those who take the dirt

1789
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,720
Although you become saying

1790
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,360
i didn't know it was dirt

1791
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,360
But you still have to put the dirt in a root

1792
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,920
so the guy who bought the dirt

1793
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,560
whether he knows or not

1794
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:56,200
I know when I'm gone

1795
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,360
finally got caught

1796
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,600
you are not worth the principle

1797
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,880
going back

1798
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,740
So according to the actual marriage of the Seven Dynasties and the appearance of the bookstore

1799
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,240
I hope a little bit will answer some of your questions

1800
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,740
But because my research is history

1801
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:15,740
Contemporary issues may be more appropriate for contemporary qualifications

1802
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:18,640
Hope to answer some of your questions

1803
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,640
Thanks

1804
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,740
Then this classmate first ask Cai Yunfeng

1805
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,740
Hello Professor

1806
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:28,240
then i have two questions

1807
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:33,580
The first question is about the criminal data and documents mentioned above.

1808
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,780
It is clearer than Qianlong's arrival

1809
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:38,480
It is the words of the seven dynasties from the front to the back

1810
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,480
His data is slowly increasing

1811
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,280
That number is because

1812
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,280
The more you go to the region and modern or modern

1813
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,280
Then his documents will be better preserved.

1814
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,880
That's why the majority

1815
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,380
The second question is

1816
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,080
Like ancient times, whether it is the Qing Dynasty or earlier

1817
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,080
That kind of comparison details

1818
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,620
Then folk clerical data

1819
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,620
If he

1820
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,260
take this secret

1821
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:02,100
that is

1822
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,300
For example, in local government offices

1823
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,540
still say yes

1824
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,000
Send it from the beginning to the center to keep it

1825
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,700
because

1826
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:09,400
i would like to say

1827
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,400
If you do research later

1828
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:13,700
He'll need some data and facts

1829
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:15,500
then he will come out of him

1830
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,700
ok thanks professor

1831
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,000
very good question

1832
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,800
Apparently this gentleman has quite an understanding of this stuff

1833
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,100
Actually it is

1834
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,600
In these judicial files leaked by the local Zhou

1835
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,100
He is roughly divided into two

1836
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,900
For example, we can roughly divide it into two

1837
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:34,300
Two categories of this justice

1838
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,200
sin of crime

1839
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,760
intermarriage iron

1840
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:38,700
intermarriage iron

1841
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,900
probably

1842
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:43,200
so-called marriage-related

1843
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,200
It's related to the division of this land.

1844
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,700
Half of this type of intermarriage

1845
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,700
now let's talk

1846
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,400
may be inferior to so-called civil cases

1847
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,400
this civil case

1848
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,400
Usually it’s OK after Zhou Xieguan finishes the sentence

1849
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,000
he doesn't have to report to that

1850
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,200
above officials

1851
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:00,100
Master Ah Xiang

1852
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
then the center does not

1853
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,440
it's ok

1854
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,440
Another kind of case is called secret channel serious case

1855
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,240
The Case of the Dead Man's Robber

1856
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,940
This is the more important case

1857
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,540
after this case

1858
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:14,940
after your previous trial

1859
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,440
You still send it all the way to the center

1860
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,240
Especially the death penalty has to be sent to the Criminal Bureau

1861
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,280
this is punishment

1862
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,640
So we're left with a lot of central archives now

1863
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,800
This file is called Criminal Division Basic

1864
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,640
Probably this kind of secret case

1865
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,680
Then collect the central archive from the place

1866
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,680
such file

1867
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:35,680
But if it is an ordinary small case

1868
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,180
Including this kind of Jiedao case

1869
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,680
In fact, it's all judged locally.

1870
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,180
so what we're left with now

1871
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,180
Why do local cases

1872
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:44,680
we can use it for research

1873
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,680
It is usually to study this

1874
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,280
mutual detection

1875
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,680
There are also relatively small cases of fishing

1876
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,520
Everyday this small this

1877
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,980
Baptism case

1878
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:57,080
Then the big wash desk is out of our readjustment area

1879
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,480
but interesting

1880
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,400
you go back to your first question today

1881
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,700
It's a question of cultural preservation

1882
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,400
Will there be surplus points in its quantity?

1883
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,100
just because of the preservation of literacy

1884
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,200
will affect your ratio in terms of quantity

1885
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,600
Of course it will and it's obvious

1886
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,600
and i say this

1887
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,100
I don’t know if this classmate can really pass an article

1888
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,600
A few years ago there was an article in American History Month Day Together

1889
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,800
big dispute

1890
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,100
That is, there are several scholars in mainland China

1891
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,500
Research House is a scholar

1892
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,200
an article he wrote in english

1893
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Statistical use of the lineage system

1894
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,800
china in qing dynasty

1895
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,200
The change in the number of his violent keystrokes

1896
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,800
Change in the number of violent keystrokes

1897
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,300
Then he felt that after the conclusion

1898
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:45,400
Many American scholars do not believe

1899
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,700
why not believe

1900
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:51,600
Because he counted the numbers from the Qing Dynasty

1901
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,200
During the Xuantong period of the Qing Dynasty

1902
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,900
Attention everyone, when Xianfeng is in court

1903
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And when the next few courts are here

1904
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
central department

1905
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,860
Or the central habit people have been blown

1906
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:09,460
So it’s hard to talk about it. Let’s talk about the period of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

1907
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:13,900
those places that happened in many war-torn areas

1908
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,260
Even if there is a secret case

1909
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,900
These cases may be sent to the central referee

1910
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,700
Impossible, it was all war

1911
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,300
Where did you go before

1912
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:27,100
So such statistics will be biased.

1913
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:30,300
jigsaw puzzle

1914
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:32,200
His statistics are problematic

1915
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,000
there is indeed a problem

1916
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,600
so from this point of view

1917
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,300
From this point of view, I also think

1918
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:41,300
The data in the table I just used is more reliable

1919
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:41,900
Why?

1920
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,300
Because there is no Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period near this place

1921
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:47,100
not actually affected by his

1922
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,800
The actual impact of the war

1923
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,100
So the stat I used

1924
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,700
So this statistic

1925
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,720
Their number may be more representative than that of the Central Bank

1926
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,120
more likely to reflect certain trends

1927
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,920
more likely to reflect certain trends

1928
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,000
Well, this is my future research.

1929
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,280
not reached yet

1930
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,240
So in the future I will mention

1931
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,720
But the problem with this conclusion is very good

1932
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,040
good professor

1933
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,080
Most of what the conclusion hearer hears is crime

1934
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,600
Most of what is heard is cut to

1935
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,080
right

1936
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,440
Then I'm more curious about

1937
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,600
Of course after the crime it's about solving the case.

1938
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,120
I see that kind of crime in the next year on being gay

1939
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,520
Of course he is down

1940
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,520
But it's cut at a glance

1941
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,400
But I'd rather know if it's a murder case

1942
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,040
homicide

1943
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,520
That is to say, the murder part

1944
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,000
He has many possibilities for the past in ancient times

1945
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,680
historical time

1946
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:51,240
How did he solve the murder case?

1947
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,720
Also, does he have any tricks?

1948
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,160
yes can share with us

1949
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,040
I think it must be interesting

1950
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,080
I rarely see that in books

1951
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,000
And the second one is that I direct something

1952
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,760
For example, like a few Tao Chaos before

1953
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,120
There will always be so-called Enemy Festival detectives

1954
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,000
what we know

1955
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,560
We read what kind of detectives he had in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

1956
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,840
can point us a bit

1957
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,200
The more interesting part

1958
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,240
Thank you, teacher

1959
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,040
ok thank you for the question

1960
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,000
But this question was originally my biggest answer

1961
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,000
real

1962
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,240
Because usually history if you don't read

1963
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,160
If you study these things yourself

1964
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,000
we dare not say too much

1965
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,000
because like secret case

1966
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,000
You can see this statistic

1967
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,760
The statistics of the part of the secret case in this quantity

1968
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:33,960
not too little

1969
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,160
For example, the secret case of Comrade Chaoyou Basic Middle

1970
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,000
put it in this

1971
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,160
But this secret case is not

1972
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,600
Everything we imagined was a secret case

1973
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,160
I don't want to be involved in this secret case

1974
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,560
Also includes unmanned entities found

1975
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,200
There are quite a few such proportions

1976
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,640
So in fact, this still needs further research.

1977
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,000
usually

1978
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,560
Secret cases will of course have subsidies and autopsies

1979
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,560
these will have it

1980
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,020
Details of these techniques and studies

1981
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:06,020
It is also worth doing research

1982
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,020
But this part is not our specialty

1983
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:11,020
What we call for young researchers

1984
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:14,020
He actually studies this type of

1985
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:16,020
So maybe his future

1986
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,020
He also belongs to one of the studies

1987
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:21,020
So future publication of his research would

1988
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,020
should be able to see

1989
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,020
can have some answers

1990
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:25,020
In addition, the detective

1991
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,020
actually

1992
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,040
should say this

1993
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,040
Taihan is like a god official

1994
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,040
because of this

1995
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,040
It's hard for us to see the valley of the gods

1996
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,040
what about these things

1997
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,040
Some people just want to write lyrics after all

1998
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,040
who knows

1999
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,040
Many officials are like this

2000
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,040
his magistrate

2001
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,040
then trial

2002
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,040
He feels very expressive

2003
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,040
He thinks he is very Thai and like a god

2004
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,040
Usually he writes in his essay

2005
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,060
will leave these judgments

2006
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,800
He feels very proud of the sentences he passed.

2007
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,600
He will leave his sentencing process behind

2008
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,400
This will appear in many people's articles

2009
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,700
I dare not say who is a political judge

2010
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:16,000
Or an official who judges a case like a trial

2011
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,400
But many of these officials left behind

2012
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,800
probably to show

2013
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,200
I'm pretty good at judging.

2014
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,200
verdict

2015
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,400
Indeed, if you look at these

2016
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,800
You'll find these officials adjudicating

2017
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,000
There are really five sets

2018
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,800
He found another suspicious place

2019
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,400
If we look at the actual case

2020
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,200
From Guo Han to the actual case

2021
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,000
Niu Yize's case left a deep impression on us

2022
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,500
there is a personal reporter

2023
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:51,900
He said how many pieces of clothes were stolen from my house

2024
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,600
Then privately vote how many pieces

2025
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,000
still how so how

2026
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:59,400
Officials came to see the benefactor

2027
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,000
just feel

2028
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,400
That is to say, you are definitely a fake

2029
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,900
so as to get outside

2030
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:08,700
Because the official looked directly at the Wu wearing

2031
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:13,000
If you can collect such precious things at home today

2032
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,900
Why Wushu is such a simple martial art

2033
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:18,900
So he can conclude except from the very beginning

2034
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:21,100
You are a slander

2035
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,800
it's none of those things

2036
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,200
is pretending

2037
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,500
And by the way I also...

2038
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,800
because here

2039
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,300
I also say by the way

2040
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,400
i see a lot of love child inside

2041
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,400
many stolen maharajas

2042
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,900
if female

2043
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:35,400
if female

2044
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,100
are all women

2045
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:39,800
And because the ex-wife is very rich

2046
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,600
so i keep joking about this

2047
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,500
When I saw this, I verified a statement from some historiography

2048
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,900
Talk about why many women in the folk want to be widows

2049
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,500
Because they said that this place is also Rational choice

2050
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,900
Yes, it's physical choice

2051
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:54,600
Why?

2052
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,100
Because according to the Chinese law at that time

2053
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,400
if you are used to it

2054
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,100
if you speed up

2055
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:13,000
After the husband passes away, if you dare to marry someone as a wife, your original husband's property will no longer be lost, and the marriage partner you originally brought will also be gone.

2056
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:29,000
That's why many women prefer to be widowed. When I was widowed, my husband's family was still mine, and the marriages I brought were still mine, and I was still mine. The big deal is to leave it to me, this is if I dare to marry, I have nothing.

2057
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So many people say, why there are so many widows today, and there are so many widows who are really graduates and law-abiding widows, is related to this rational right.

2058
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I said, at least from what I saw in this case, it is true that many of the stolen women were widows and married, and I did not marry in vain.

2059
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:57,000
But when they sell newspapers, they talk about women, I am so pitiful, I have been a widow all my life, even if I have a little suspicion, I will be stolen into women, but you can see that she has a lot of marriages.

2060
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Likewise, many people are widows.

2061
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So the scholars behind it still have what they say

2062
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I am a reader of everything

2063
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
all my life

2064
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Wow how to live at home

2065
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
But you find that the things behind the house are still valuable

2066
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
a lot of money

2067
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
So Nusheng is writing Zhuangzi or everyone knows

2068
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
How much effort is spent when writing Zhuangzi

2069
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Anyway, if the scene is not accepted

2070
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
that's not good

2071
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
So many people did not have the so-called shouchi at that time

2072
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
So I was still writing Zhuangzi

2073
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Not Zhou Xingzi's era

2074
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Designation of Zhou Xingzi's age

2075
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
This shouchi basic writing method is writing Zhuangzi

2076
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
you really

2077
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I

2078
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
can i ask this question

2079
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
our next last question

2080
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,000

2081
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Let the gentleman at A3 ask first

2082
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Dear Teacher Gu

2083
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen, everyone

2084
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:09,200
Li Longzhang of the Qing Dynasty wanted to organize the subsequent Jinghui in Beiliang

2085
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:15,600
He does a sex act

2086
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:21,200
If we talk about the guilt at that time

2087
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:25,800
Is there a redemption situation

2088
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,000
Is to use nutrition to redeem

2089
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:37,200
How much nutrition can be used to atone for a country change?

2090
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,200
Thanks

2091
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,800
thank you sir

2092
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,200
this question is important

2093
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,400
But I can only say that I am not specialized in research

2094
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,400
I have a postdoc

2095
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:50,900
The graduate of the University of Architecture is called KIM

2096
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,800
he is doing this now

2097
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,600
Generally speaking, let me explain a little bit

2098
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,000
This crime in China is treason

2099
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,220
common crime

2100
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:06,540
That is to say, what sentence have you been sentenced to?

2101
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:08,540
but you can spend money

2102
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:11,540
It's a vulgar crime that can be exonerated

2103
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,460
Then at this time in the Ming Dynasty

2104
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,960
such sinful videos

2105
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,960
Everyone can use vulgar crimes

2106
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,960
may not be sentenced directly

2107
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,460
It is also a serious crime

2108
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,200
But the Qing Dynasty is different

2109
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,460
Since the Qing Dynasty, many criminal laws

2110
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,960
is a veritable conviction

2111
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,460
You are going to study this criminal law

2112
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,620
It's hard for you to sign it with money

2113
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,620
So this is obviously in the Qing Dynasty

2114
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,120
Compared with the Ming Dynasty

2115
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,620
it changes the actual

2116
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:42,120
Then when it came to the middle and late Qing Dynasty

2117
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,620
Because the country's finances are poor

2118
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:47,620
So many so-called donations

2119
01:27:47,620 --> 01:27:50,620
Or there are a lot of cases of bureaucrats

2120
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,620
There are many cases of vulgar crimes

2121
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,620
That's because the central government is short of money

2122
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:57,620
He hopes to use the money to supplement

2123
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
will become more and more complicated

2124
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
will become more and more inconvenient

2125
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
But this atonement situation

2126
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
if put in this steal

2127
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
rare

2128
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
rare

2129
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Why?

2130
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
because I just mentioned

2131
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
who actually stole

2132
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
most of the family

2133
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Let's live these

2134
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Restraint next time

2135
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
otherwise

2136
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Although there are occupations

2137
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Although there is an identity

2138
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
But it's not necessarily a person who spends a lot of money

2139
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
So usually this

2140
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
steal love this

2141
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
seldom atonement

2142
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Plus we just saw

2143
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
the stolen thing

2144
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
If the price is not high

2145
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
His luggage is heavy

2146
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
probably a few

2147
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
That's twenty. Thirty is amazing.

2148
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
so usually stolen love

2149
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Rarely sentenced

2150
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
rarely foreclosed

2151
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
There is a way of redemption

2152
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
don't bother

2153
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,000
But the question you want to know

2154
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
My future postdoctoral fellow

2155
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
He will have some further

2156
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
this study

2157
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
very convenient

2158
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
then maybe we can

2159
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
find a better answer

2160
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Thanks

2161
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You know that I have a little question I want to ask

2162
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
You said itchy head and dirty sixty

2163
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Am I dead?

2164
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
dirty sixty that's not pretty

2165
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
In fact, according to his law

2166
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Does he just pat lightly?

2167
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
When you are dirty and twenty or forty, you will lose your stomach

2168
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
So I thought it was weird then

2169
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
this is their rule

2170
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
But in fact, most of the cases are actually one or two strokes

2171
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So in fact, sometimes you can't take so many photos at all.

2172
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And the report is in a trance

2173
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
In fact, many cases cannot be solved at all.

2174
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Yes, that is, a small head

2175
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
even if he gets caught

2176
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It's hard for him to finally get to the closing part

2177
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Sometimes it stays off for a long time

2178
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Then see me and die

2179
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,600
Sometimes it may be possible to solve the case, probably with a small penalty

2180
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:09,360
Then hand it over to Baojia, and hand it over to the dentist

2181
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,560
control

2182
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,600
Then when restraining him, if he commits another crime, he will be treated with questioning

2183
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,400
lock him up

2184
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,600
But actually, let's just say

2185
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,400
I can't finish arresting criminals and concubines.

2186
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,100
And the concubine actually knows the dentist himself

2187
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,900
Many people know that Momoren is a concubine

2188
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:33,200
Then these concubines are a bit like our current professional climbers

2189
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,400
In fact, he climbed and climbed for a period of time

2190
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,900
He closed the mountain again, and went back to his proper job

2191
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:42,500
Then after a while of doing proper work, I went to climb, go to work, and go to screw

2192
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,200
So sometimes the real men catch those

2193
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,000
Obviously know that he is a concubine

2194
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,800
But just can't find evidence to catch him

2195
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,300
This is like the Yi Zhimei bunny inside

2196
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,900
In fact, because I soon knew that Yi Zhimei, you are a little rabbit

2197
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:58,600
But just can't find evidence to catch him

2198
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:00,000
Because he stole probably all

2199
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,240
So I won't sell or take it out

2200
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,640
so hard to catch

2201
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,640
then this is all

2202
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,240
I think it's all on paper

2203
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,960
official articles

2204
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,440
what about the fact

2205
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,040
did you fight

2206
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:16,760
right

2207
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,760
Article Center of Peng Guo Articles

2208
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,760
In fact, we can't see it in the party

2209
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:24,400
Because in the end he ended up betting

2210
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,800
Or the official said

2211
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,800
Make up for this responsibility

2212
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,760
But it didn't say that the responsibility of eating is the responsibility of the component

2213
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,760
It's usually about taking the blame

2214
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,760
Including those supplements, if he

2215
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,260
according to the law

2216
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:39,760
If he didn't catch it at the scene

2217
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:42,260
He also wants this account to be deducted

2218
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:46,060
But how to beat him again

2219
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:48,060
usually in writing

2220
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,060
we don't see what it actually means

2221
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:51,060
so

2222
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:52,060
really

2223
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:53,060
Thanks

2224
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:55,060
hard to decide

2225
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:56,560
because I can say anyway

2226
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,720
It is recommended that everyone can raise a dog yellow dog

2227
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,040
Compared with my dog, it is useless to say that this kind of dog is now a pet

2228
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:11,640
My family has a Shanzi dog. The puppy stole all the downstairs and only sent it outside.

2229
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:17,320
Because it's useless, now it's a pet, not a dog imitation, it's useless at all

2230
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:27,840
This is the end of our lecture today, thank you very much for this wonderful lecture by Professor Wu

2231
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:34,080
Then the audience responded very enthusiastically, and everyone can invite him again in private

2232
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,080
thank you all
