1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
can't.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:48,080
Academia Sinica's August knowledge feast lecture begins.

3
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,080
Please ask Vice President Chen Jianren to host for us.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,260
It's gentlemen. Good night, everyone.

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,360
Today I am very glad that we were able to invite you from the branch of our Central Research Institute

6
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,120
very distinguished scholar

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,800
Teacher Cai came to give us a very important speech

8
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,640
The case before Teacher Cai started to give a speech

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,000
I said I need a brief introduction

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,600
Mr. Cai, he graduated from our National Taiwan University with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,760
After graduation, he went to Carnegie University in Pennsylvania to complete his Ph.D.

12
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,040
After finishing his Ph.D., he continued to study at the University of San Diego in California, USA.

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,760
Three and a half years as a postdoctoral researcher

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,360
Then came back to Taiwan, back to Taiwan in 1994

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,200
After returning to Taiwan, the performance is quite outstanding

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,440
Teacher Cai's research in the part of molecular biology

17
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,000
The research done is published in the world's leading journals

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
As scientists, there is a journal in

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Nature is already amazing

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,020
Then he not only has Science on NATURE

21
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,260
this is a scientific journal

22
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,260
The natural journals I just talked about, the scientific journals

23
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,700
Cell Journal

24
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
ShareJournals

25
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,700
So if a person can have three papers

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Publishing in these journals is already amazing

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,100
but more importantly

28
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,700
in recent years

29
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,900
This teacher Cai's laboratory published papers

30
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,300
He has six papers

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,700
It is a better journal abroad

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,500
he will have some recommendations

33
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Unit's website

34
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
That's called Faculty 1000

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
He has six papers recommended in Faculty 1000

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
This is not easy

37
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,500
So today Mr. Cai can come to give us a speech

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
it's an honor for all of us

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Teacher Cai's absorption of nutrients in this plant

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
and interest transmission

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
There is a very in-depth study of this

42
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,500
In addition to publishing his research results in very important journals

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
other than what i just said

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
He also because of his research results are very good

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
So it's a prize winner

46
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
frequent prize winner

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,400
He won the Outstanding Award of the Hot Pot Club

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
and academic awards from the Ministry of Education

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,760
Then the Young Scholar Award of the China-Ireland Research Institute

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
just came back

51
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,400
are quite outstanding

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
that's also important

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,800
That is to say, Mr. Cai is winning the prize

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,560
This is beyond count

55
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,440
Also a very important thing is

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
He also trained many students

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,560
Some students from his lab also came today

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
just had dinner with them

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,040
His laboratory has a characteristic

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,240
boys are happy

61
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,680
He has many hosts

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,400
Many of them are just kidding

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,080
But this teacher Cai is very admired by the students

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,680
and loves coming to his lab

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
like this summer vacation

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,000
He has five undergraduate students

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
to his lab

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,040
Including those who have not yet come from Hong Kong

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,160
So he seems to be quite famous internationally.

70
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,040
and highly valued

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,240
then we are really happy

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,520
Today we have a feast of knowledge in August

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,240
I can invite Teacher Cai

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,920
come do it with us

75
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
so

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,420
I think everyone will be rewarded with a speech given by

77
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,120
Then look at the title itself, it is already very attractive

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,320
Right? The beauty and sadness of light fat

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Everyone knows that Beauty and Sorrow is a famous novel

80
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
Everyone knows Japanese novels

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
Then let's listen to how plants count

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,360
There is also a memory map to let the content of the sales face inside

83
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,920
The content of sales color is very important for the growth of plants

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,920
then today we

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,080
After listening to the speech, we believe

86
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,560
There will be a deeper understanding of the beauty and sorrow of light fat

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,280
We'll cycle around at

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,480
around 8.5

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,440
Q&A for everyone

90
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,640
If it's in the middle, we'll ask Mr. Cai

91
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,480
Let's talk from the beginning to the end

92
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,640
If we are comfortable, Tiger Claw will come to welcome Teacher Cai.

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,520
Today I would like to thank the Vice President for his introduction

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,400
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to chat with you

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
beauty and sorrow

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,000
what is its beauty

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Well, here is a picture of the population of the whole world

98
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,400
You can see from 1800 years ago

99
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
1800 to present

100
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,600
The sudden increase in the population at this turning point

101
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,200
Before 1940 to 1960

102
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,900
a big turning point

103
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,500
that is now at this point

104
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,400
they estimated

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,400
If the current growth rate

106
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,700
Our population will be as high as 16 billion

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,700
That's what it looks like if it slows down

108
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,100
hope to reduce

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,500
So what caused such a big turning point

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,700
some say there is no war

111
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,300
no war, yes

112
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,100
absence of war is an important factor

113
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
Another very important factor is

114
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,100
During this period a green revolution took place

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,500
what is green revolution

116
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,900
The green revolution was an agricultural revolution

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,000
it's not like

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Our revolution is shaken and cold

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So its de facto deadline is hard to set

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But from 1940 to 1970

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This green revolution created

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Saved hundreds of millions of people from starvation

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It also created this opportunity to allow the world's population to rise

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Several important components of the green revolution

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
One of them is the generation of high-volume new products

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is the technique of Yu Zongxue

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
many new varieties

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There is also the establishment of an open system

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Next is the modernization of management technology

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There is also a very important factor

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It is the use of fertilizers and sand insecticides

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Fertilizers are what we're talking about today

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Sand insecticide also has its beauty and ugly

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
not something we can talk about today

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Today we are talking about the beauty and ugly of fertilizer

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
ok i believe here

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Many people have flowers in their homes

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Maybe they all went to Jianguo Flower Market to buy fertilizer

139
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
What is the composition of the fertilizer?

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
one hundred percent

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,320
good egg zero leave

142
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Inside the egg is about two to four percent of the dry plant

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
actually the most important

144
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
The ingredients are probably egg zero fake inside from

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,400
The highest content of zero, false

146
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,560
The sources of these three fertilizers

147
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,360
Zero and fake are probably obtained from minerals

148
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,600
only eggs

149
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,160
At present, it is artificially synthesized into the mass

150
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,160
That

151
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Why is egg fat important?

152
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,000
This is actually an experiment done in Rosenstadt, England

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In fact from 1840 until now

154
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,920
they do different nutrients

155
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,560
Effects on Plant Growth

156
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,960
Then when I first returned to Taiwan in 1994

157
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,600
Just ran to this Rosenstadt to visit

158
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,120
That's because of the influence of a teacher over there

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,640
a special technique

160
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,760
He can measure the cytoplasm

161
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,320
What is the content of antiaciditis

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,760
i thought wow amazing

163
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,920
I hurried to ask him that I can not study

164
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,000
so i went

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,000
Then he went and said do you want to go to this

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
take a walk inside the fuel

167
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,920
I didn't know then

168
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,480
this is such a historical thing

169
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,840
walk in that path

170
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,680
It's walking in that stage of history

171
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,480
then go here

172
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,160
see this long-running experiment

173
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,520
what this experiment tells

174
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,760
Tell us the importance of leading the armor

175
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,680
this is a different year

176
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,440
1872 to 1881

177
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,680
or 1985 to the 90s

178
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,360
You can see that nothing is added

179
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,600
This yields 0.9

180
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
Here is 2.6

181
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
there is a difference

182
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,320
why is it higher

183
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
This is the birth of new species

184
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,280
Therefore, the yield of new varieties is relatively high

185
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,200
that early agriculture

186
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,520
just rely on the sky to eat

187
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
How much fertility is this soil corridor

188
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,880
how much you eat

189
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,920
But then they knew

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,880
If I add some nutrients

191
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,280
If light adds zero heel armor

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
increases its output

193
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,660
The current new varieties have no way to increase the zero price

194
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,160
But I don't add zero price

195
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,800
Just add eggs and you will see

196
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,460
The output can be doubled

197
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,720
That's of course the best case scenario

198
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,100
Egg zero price you give all

199
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,360
Just like the fertilizer we bought at the Jianguo Flower Market

200
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,660
just look good

201
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,160
This one is actually the same idea

202
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,000
but you can see the time change

203
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,600
Sure enough, after the green revolution, the output increased

204
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,760
They use some of the most popular

205
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,520
wheat to grow such an experiment

206
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,720
Then you can watch

207
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,280
this picture

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,080
Another thing to look at is

209
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,800
after adding zero and false

210
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
So add different amount of eggs

211
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,400
Forty-eight kilograms of eggs are added here

212
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,880
Then add one hundred and forty-four

213
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,600
you can see that the yield increases

214
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,880
In fact, it is more obvious

215
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,880
We can use the following picture to see

216
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,680
This is the different amount of eggs

217
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,760
Then its output increases

218
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,920
Then actually this picture

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
also explained a very important thing

220
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,440
Increasing production can indeed

221
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,160
while increasing egg fertilizer

222
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,240
The number of eggs can indeed increase production

223
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,960
but to a certain extent

224
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,400
actually you are increasing

225
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,280
did not increase production

226
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,640
this is actually

227
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
A branch of the Taiwan Council of Agriculture wants to tell the farmers

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,520
Don't add too much egg fat

229
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,160
Then I'll tell you why you shouldn't add more lamp ash

230
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
In fact, the output is not

231
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
But for a farmer

232
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,640
We see these small gaps

233
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,040
we don't feel that important

234
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,080
But for farmers

235
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,600
he refused to post

236
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,440
that danger lowers production a bit

237
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,880
It must be added to the fullest.

238
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,320
What about the lack of eggs?

239
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,800
the first time you can see the lack of eggs

240
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,480
Plants are of course small

241
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,320
Not only does it turn yellow when you first see it

242
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,960
Then yellowing and what?

243
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,160
How do plants without eggs actually taste?

244
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,120
Astringent and light but very hard

245
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
because it smells fishy

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Excessive fibrosis, not tasty

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So vegetables must have a lot of egg fat

248
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
so fresh and sweet

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
well , source of egg fat

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's talk about the history of egg fertilizer

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The earliest egg fertilizer was bird droppings

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
really fun

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This island is full of bird droppings

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This white thing is all bird droppings

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You can see that the bird was full at that time

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You can't find an open space to occupy that dive level

257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's because the flock of birds live there

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Then come here again it won't rain

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So that guano is accumulating on that island

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So start digging these

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You see this is the port a ship is taking it out of

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
From 1884 to 1990

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
rely on this guano

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But it will run out soon

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
then what should we do

266
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
OK, the next step is to pick

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,840
Ore has a natural hydrating stone

268
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,940
called Soulpeter

269
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,580
It is mainly Acid Acid

270
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,680
Where is it produced then?

271
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,580
south american

272
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,240
Atagamasamo

273
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
Atacama

274
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,280
Dazer

275
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,380
I write about South America here

276
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,980
It's weird why I just wrote about Peru

277
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
How about not writing a country here?

278
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,780
it's actually fun

279
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,140
This fertilizer saliva

280
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,980
also sparked war

281
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,880
You can imagine it's mastering the source of that grain

282
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,880
it sparked a war of limestone

283
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,620
Well, this summer actually used to be in

284
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,880
bolivia and peru

285
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,820
But where are the mining rights?

286
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,020
mining rights in intellectual

287
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,480
That is to say, mining technology

288
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,420
Intellectual comparison, development is more advanced

289
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,120
So it has mining technology

290
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,620
So in fact, you can't step into other people's houses to pick them.

291
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,820
It's been a long time since the material was picked

292
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,520
just say it's mine

293
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,500
Of course such a precious mineral

294
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,260
The two countries fought against each other

295
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,860
Played for four years, but was robbed by intelligence

296
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,100
So that Dazer is now Intellectual

297
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,060
This Dazer is actually still picking

298
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,100
And it used to be the largest industry in intelligence

299
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,860
Intelligence is equal to relying on this to start

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
feed more intelligence

301
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,660
Around 1912 was the peak time

302
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,000
Then its total content was estimated to be about 920 at that time

303
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Million tons

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,100
At that time, I wanted to say that when I encountered this mine, I thought

305
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,200
It has been installed for 340 years and I can't finish it

306
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,660
Unexpectedly, I just said

307
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,160
Because of the green revolution and then the demand for fertilizers increased

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,840
this amount they say

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,640
In fact, it's gone in about two or three years now.

310
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,000
So we must find other ways

311
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,280
well what method

312
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,200
synthetic

313
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,240
good source of eggs

314
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Where is the biggest egg

315
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
inside the air

316
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,040
79% of the air is eggs

317
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,880
but we can't use it

318
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,680
what to do

319
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Fortunately at that time

320
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,120
there was a german chemist

321
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:32,960
Harbor

322
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,360
he invented

323
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,520
use a

324
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,800
high pressure

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,040
high temperature method

326
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,960
turn the egg into green

327
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,040
compression

328
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,200
after fix

329
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,000
catalyzed by iron

330
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
let it produce an

331
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
this is harvard law

332
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,400
this way

333
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,680
Rescue the need for egg fertilizer

334
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,120
well worth mentioning

335
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,320
Harvard law

336
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,680
actually

337
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,560
someone said

338
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,800
this is human

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
One of the most important chemical reactions in the history of development

340
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,500
Because the egg on each of you

341
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,800
The formation of most proteins exists

342
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Half of it came by this method

343
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,700
They say this is the greatest invention

344
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,900
Sure enough, he also won the Nobel Prize.

345
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,100
Actually I just mentioned

346
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,600
He's a chemist, he invented this method

347
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
but industrialized him

348
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,100
In fact, Bosch did it

349
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,900
So someone actually said that this method

350
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,700
It should be a way for two people to cooperate

351
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,900
More controversially, Hoffer

352
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,800
Hoffer gave him the Nobel Prize

353
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,600
He was given the Nobel Prize in 1918

354
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,700
the nobel prize

355
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,200
It's actually kind of controversial

356
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,700
Everyone wants such a great invention

357
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,400
why no nobel prize

358
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Actually he has another invention

359
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,200
very harmful to humans

360
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,100
He was the one who made the poison gas of the first world war

361
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
So he was the poison gas of WWI

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,440
He participated in the first generation of chemical warfare

363
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,380
a man full of tragedy

364
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,460
his son, his wife

365
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,780
can't stand

366
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,400
How many people died by chemical gas and committed suicide

367
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,340
So this is a half-baked scientist

368
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,080
He saved a technology that we humans are still using continuously

369
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,000
But he also made

370
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,900
he does it for himself

371
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,580
He famously said

372
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,220
He said a chemist was of the world in times of peace

373
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,280
Belongs to the country in time of war

374
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,100
so he thinks he's doing the right thing

375
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,920
anyway we have no way to evaluate this matter

376
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,220
but you can know that

377
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:50,340
This Bahafa has really caused the human population to

378
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,720
a reason for boom

379
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,760
so until now

380
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,760
what i tell you is

381
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
light fat beauty

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Where is love?

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
First, he consumes energy

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I just said that he needs high temperature and high pressure

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Where do these high temperatures and pressures come from?

386
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Of course, energy is needed to produce

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What does this energy depend on?

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Powered by our world's energy

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
in fact they say

390
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The consumption of Harvard law

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
1% of the world's energy is consumed on this

392
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
we also know

393
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Energy is now becoming more and more precious

394
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So the pressure is getting higher and higher

395
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But the demand for light fertilizer is increasing every year

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Now it's about 90 a year

397
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Minion tons, million tons

398
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Then it is estimated that it may soar to 140 or so in the future

399
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Just because we talked about the energy crisis

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Energy It has such an energy-consuming reaction

401
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
so fat

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,840
The price of fertilizers soars every year

403
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,140
Now increase by 20% to 25% every year

404
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,940
From here we can see

405
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,740
before you planted crops

406
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,360
Three Biggest Investments

407
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,140
one is to buy fertilizer

408
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,680
buy more seeds

409
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,740
Next is insect repellent

410
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,560
in 2005

411
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,080
For example, in the case of soybeans

412
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,400
Buying fertilizer is about 25%

413
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,220
Then the seeds make up about 32%

414
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,820
Then 92% of the investment in pest control

415
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,120
By 2009

416
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,920
different species

417
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,480
40% of the cost of fertilizers

418
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,520
So it's like saying you're going to spend

419
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,340
40% of your fee

420
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,400
is to invest in the purchase of fertilizers

421
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,700
So the cost is getting higher and higher

422
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,720
That

423
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,540
It's not the saddest thing

424
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,840
This is not the biggest sorrow

425
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,900
money problems can be solved

426
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,180
Energy problems can be solved

427
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
can also be solved

428
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,720
The most unsolvable thing is the pollution of the environment

429
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,520
what kind of environmental pollution

430
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,840
But there is only one problem

431
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,760
In fact, the fertilizer use rate of wet down is very low

432
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,360
can be used by plants

433
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
Most are exploited at 30%

434
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,920
Most of them cannot be used by plants

435
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,400
How about using plants?

436
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,280
it will wash away

437
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,840
that or it produces nitrous oxide

438
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,520
This nitrous oxide is a ratio

439
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,120
we are all talking now

440
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,640
that greenhouse gas

441
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Greenhouse gases talk about liquid nitrogen oxide every time

442
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,640
nitrous oxide

443
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,320
N2O is actually more nitrogen dioxide than CO2

444
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,160
Nitrogen is even more toxic

445
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,000
300 times more poisonous than a single greenhouse gas

446
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,840
its effects can last

447
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,520
and more serious

448
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
this is a problem

449
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,040
Another problem is that

450
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,900
Of course, the moisture absorption is 30%

451
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,140
others will be lost

452
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,240
Wash it away, where does it go?

453
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,740
flushed into groundwater

454
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,240
flushed to the river, flushed to the sea

455
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,040
What happens when it is washed into rivers and oceans?

456
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,840
euoxidative

457
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,840
Euoxidation means it has too much oxygen

458
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,400
What happens when there is too much oxygen?

459
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,400
algae will grow

460
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
so beautiful, green

461
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,800
Look, this green algae

462
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,400
From this is NASA's aerial photo

463
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,800
You can see the way out of the sea

464
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,700
The sea estuary of the farming area, a piece of green

465
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,900
Very beautiful, green, green algae

466
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,800
Chlorella can also be a healthy food

467
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,300
but it causes hypoxia

468
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,460
due to the proliferation of algae

469
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,160
its body sank

470
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,800
will consume the sheep along with the scorpion body

471
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,200
resulting in the waters being completely devoid of sheep

472
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,240
A condition of hypoxia

473
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Oxygen-deficient to the point where fish and shrimp cannot grow

474
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,400
this is the empty photo

475
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,000
Another piece of information about the aerial photo just now

476
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
you can see

477
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,440
The whole side is hypoxic

478
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,240
The red ones are places that lack oxygen

479
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
Then it can cause the whole fish and shrimp to die

480
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Instantly all die like this

481
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
How severely affected are the areas

482
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
look at this

483
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
this is me from

484
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Warsauce Institute

485
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
as the information

486
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
look

487
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
1850 to 1940

488
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
before the green revolution

489
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This world is Binding

490
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
clean

491
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
nothing

492
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
good

493
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
40 to 50 starts in the US

494
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
scorpion head

495
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
may start to appear

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Oxidation problem

497
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
again

498
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
California also appeared

499
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,240
Then the European side also began to appear

500
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,240
wow the problem is getting worse

501
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,680
It's 1980

502
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,280
1990

503
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
2000

504
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,580
It is worth mentioning that from 2000 to 2010

505
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,380
I think this issue is starting to be taken seriously

506
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,680
has slowed down slightly

507
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,680
but still quite serious

508
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,780
you see there are problems everywhere

509
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,880
In fact, the fertilizer problem on the mainland is also very serious.

510
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,760
We suffer from being in this place

511
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Okay, so the layers of influence add up to be so broad.

512
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,160
So what is the only way to solve this problem?

513
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,660
Only by how can we increase the utilization efficiency of plant eggs

514
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,760
Let it only use 30% of the 30% it just cast

515
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,840
It can be increased to 50%, 60% or even 70%, preferably 100%

516
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
There will be no such excess flow out

517
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,160
So our experiment is

518
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
is to understand things like this from a plant point of view

519
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,960
Alright, let's talk about how plants use eggs

520
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,200
Most plants have three sources of eggs

521
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,960
The first is the leguminous

522
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,320
just said

523
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,720
It only has legumes that can make eggs

524
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Legumes don't fix eggs by themselves

525
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,360
It is to live in symbiosis with the solid egg

526
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,680
Then you can fix the egg

527
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,960
What's a solid egg? Just like Haber's law

528
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,640
This bacterium is so smart

529
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,480
before the invention of haber

530
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,760
He knows how to put N2 in the air

531
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
fix down

532
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,160
then fix down

533
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,600
So this is a leguminous plant

534
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,080
but it produces root flow

535
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,720
That root flow is actually

536
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,520
You can see this root flow

537
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,400
It's actually a bit pink and red when it's made.

538
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,080
Why is that red?

539
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
This redness is the same as the redness of our blood vessels

540
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,680
It is a skin membrane Chinese medicine disease

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,400
called like hemoglobin

542
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,000
The snowball protein of this red snowball is the same

543
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,600
Why does it have this protein to grab oxygen

544
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,400
Because it fixes the N2 enzyme in the air

545
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,200
Low function when aerobic

546
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,000
So their symbiosis is very subtle

547
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
what about it

548
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,200
The food helps this egg-fixing fungus create an oxygen-deficient environment

549
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,560
The first way is to protect it

550
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,160
Enclosed to prevent oxygen from entering

551
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,600
Then it produces this protein

552
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,000
grab the oxygen

553
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
With the help of these two

554
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,600
The egg-fixing efficiency of egg-fixing bacteria is very high

555
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,200
and so the two of them are great mates

556
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,800
He fixes his eggs and gives them to the plants

557
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,600
What do plants give back?

558
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,800
The sugar eggs produced by photosynthesis give it

559
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,000
So two symbiotic

560
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So botanists also have

561
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,300
Another dream is

562
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,260
If all the plants in the world

563
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
We can live together with Gu Danjun

564
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Oh, let's save trouble

565
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,260
We don't have any of the so-called sorrows just now

566
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,260
But this dream is still a little far away

567
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,100
because they know

568
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,860
Between Gu Danjun and Plants

569
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,260
There are several levels of interaction

570
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,760
it's like falling in love

571
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,260
It takes a long time to talk to be able to succeed like this

572
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,720
Then they have a lot of contacts

573
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,960
To be able to form such a special organ

574
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,720
then be careless

575
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,160
so far

576
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,520
Or is it limited to Douke plants that can do one thing?

577
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,020
What are the egg balls of other plants?

578
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,320
mainly two

579
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,160
Nitrate, nitrate or saddle salt

580
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,160
talk about it here

581
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,120
whole egg

582
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,720
in the earth

583
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,460
the looping situation

584
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
that just mentioned

585
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,460
fix the N2 in the air

586
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,340
there are several ways

587
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,100
an industrial method

588
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,040
Or in fact nitrogen-fixing bacteria

589
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,900
There are also some free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria that can also do

590
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,960
or just said

591
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,700
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live in symbiosis with plants can do this

592
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,660
In fact, most of our plants

593
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,000
really usable

594
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,540
It's that legume that does this

595
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,740
most plants

596
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,940
There are only two forms that can really be used

597
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,540
Aminitis or antiaciditis to use

598
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,300
That's actually

599
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,700
Most of the wet manure

600
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,700
You don't have to take antiacid all

601
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,000
However, many currently commonly used urea

602
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,100
superior

603
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,000
But no matter what egg you give it

604
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,200
within a day or two

605
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,100
some bacteria in the soil

606
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,900
will quickly turn it into antiaciditis

607
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,060
that's why

608
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,240
Another reason why the absorption efficiency of light fertilizer is so poor

609
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,600
Siolate is negatively charged

610
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,960
Soil ions and particles are also negatively charged

611
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,320
So shaved salt is actually very difficult to preserve in the soil.

612
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,000
I just said that soon I don't want to convert to

613
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,400
When the plants have no time to absorb

614
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,440
Then it rained again and it was over

615
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,520
Xiaoyan is washed away and disappears

616
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,960
So a small part of the plants can also use amine inflammation

617
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,960
However, the content of amine inflammation in the soil is relatively low

618
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,880
Soon it will be converted to sulphate

619
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,320
So for plants

620
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,960
Most of it is inhaled in the form of sulphate

621
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,120
Our laboratory has been

622
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,000
It's about understanding how plants use siolate

623
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,360
Looking forward to the day we can think of a

624
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,760
There can be good ways to increase the water use efficiency of plants

625
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,720
what material do we use

626
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:02,980
not this one

627
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,340
This one was when I went to Canada with my students for a meeting

628
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,580
saw a tree

629
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,540
Look, this is that Reu that is big

630
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,420
The big tree on the west coast of Canada and California

631
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,220
You can see how big this tree is

632
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,020
But it looks like the Arab world

633
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,340
Arab world is small

634
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,500
how small is it

635
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,660
Okay, you can put a copper plate in here

636
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
you probably can't see

637
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,460
can't find a spot on this ground

638
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,140
The Arab world is actually about the size of a copper plate

639
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,180
that or you have seen that

640
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,420
The small tube that is often used in our laboratory

641
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,420
its size like this

642
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,220
So the Arab world is very inconspicuous, very small

643
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,140
But it's a plant that we use as a model

644
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,540
that is because it is small

645
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,740
what's the benefit of being small

646
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,540
Small is that the vice president doesn't need to give me a field

647
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,700
i can experiment

648
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,900
All the people who make plants experiment with rice or bath mud

649
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,300
I think the vice president's head will be big like this

650
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,100
we use this

651
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
I just want a small room

652
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,900
i can feed us all the time

653
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,700
required plants

654
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,500
But it has all the information of all the plants in it

655
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,800
so why we chose it as a model plant

656
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,100
You see, this is the one we use in our lab

657
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,700
15 cm patch dish

658
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:33,500
It is possible to plant 1000 small sprouts

659
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,300
If you want to be in the newly sprouted

660
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,200
When you are sifting bean sprouts

661
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,500
you can be like this

662
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,300
So many provinces and cities can do things in such a small space

663
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,300
So this is one of the advantages of Awakai

664
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,000
What is another advantage

665
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,700
it has a short growing season

666
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,200
from seed to seed

667
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,300
6 weeks to 8 weeks

668
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,800
it's amazing

669
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,300
In fact, I often follow

670
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,800
Let me talk about it now, my Pitch D, when I was in my Ph.D.

671
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,600
A cycle of summer mother fungus is three days

672
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,200
That's me from the sheep to do the experiment for three days

673
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Then later switch to this experiment

674
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,000
I can't wait

675
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,500
For six weeks I was watering all day

676
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,800
Seedling growth is probably like me

677
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,000
I hope he grows up soon

678
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,200
I can do an experiment soon

679
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,400
But it's too short for a professional

680
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,600
six weeks

681
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,600
Six to eight weeks from seed to seed

682
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,600
So that's why everyone didn't use big jobs later

683
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,400
I took this small job

684
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
This one is very convenient

685
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
We saw it and said wow this is the Arab world

686
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,200
But it's fun to be so big

687
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,800
Okay, so the first thing we need to know is

688
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,800
The first job to use it is

689
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,200
How to suck it in from the picture

690
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,600
Okay, between talking about how it sucks in

691
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,800
Let me talk about the cell membrane first

692
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,200
Every cell expresses its special cold mist

693
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
content of something

694
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But this cell and another cell

695
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,500
why is it different

696
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
it needs a membrane to wrap it up

697
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,000
what is this membrane

698
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,500
I think membrane is a super material

699
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,000
it this film

700
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
inside a drop of oil on the water

701
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
will it mix

702
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,500
float on top

703
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,000
That is, oil and water will not mix and separate.

704
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
This membrane is oil

705
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Imagine that outside the cell is

706
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
thin layer of oil

707
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
separate it

708
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
This oil is a super material

709
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
why

710
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
first it separates it

711
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Then there is another advantage

712
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This membrane has a characteristic

713
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
it because here is acute

714
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Intermediate is non-acute

715
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
it does not allow holes

716
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you go to the membrane of the cell

717
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
rub a hole

718
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
as long as not too fast

719
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you shrink back

720
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
it will be back in no time

721
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
super material

722
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
If our synthesized material is so good

723
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to do our stuff

724
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
all great

725
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
never a hole

726
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,600
Okay, but this cell can't be too nerdy

727
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,600
It wants to exchange its material with the outside world

728
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,100
it's going to stretch it needs something to come in

729
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,000
And it needs to know what the outside environment is like

730
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,100
It's easy to react, what should I do?

731
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,900
We will make holes in this membrane

732
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,500
This is the protein on the membrane

733
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,100
Then there are some proteins that do material exchange

734
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,000
Some proteins are to understand changes in the external environment

735
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,200
What our laboratory is doing is a hardening that is responsible for absorbing nitrates

736
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,600
We're called transsclerostin, blood, blood, blood, blood

737
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,800
Then I bought this structure in 1990 when I was a postdoctoral fellow at Grandpa Shen

738
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,600
I started playing with this protein

739
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,300
I didn't see what protein looks like until earlier this year

740
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,900
This structure was solved

741
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,760
Never knew each other for 20 years

742
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,960
I don't know what he looks like

743
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,600
Today I finally saw his face like a mountain

744
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,560
he looks like this

745
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,160
So he is spread on this mold

746
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,200
remove the acid circle from outside the cell

747
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,160
a protein delivered into the cell

748
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,960
he is showing in the root

749
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,160
this is the root of a plant

750
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,560
root

751
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,440
this is the apex

752
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,360
root tip is fun

753
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,520
The root tip will secrete some Lunhua fluid

754
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
So the root actually has another benefit

755
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,520
He wants to brick in the soil

756
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,120
so he wants that brick

757
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,960
his cells responsible for absorbing

758
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,960
These cells right in the epidermis

759
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,560
cells or even elongated

760
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,560
root hair

761
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,120
in charge of absorbing

762
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,920
The transporter we just talked about

763
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,160
in these cells

764
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,480
responsible for putting outside

765
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,320
Xiao sour circles in the soil

766
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,920
suck into the plant

767
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
there is a question

768
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
just mentioned hydrochloric acid

769
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
No matter what it looks like, the egg is in the soil

770
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
or animal carcasses

771
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Temperament also corrupts it

772
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
convert to digestate

773
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
let plants absorb

774
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But if the plant does not absorb

775
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
or how

776
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
salt in the soil

777
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
less likely to be preserved

778
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So the content of hydrochloric acid in the soil

779
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
dramatic change

780
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
this is what i borrow

781
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
This Tony Miller actually

782
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
That's when I went to Lawson's Day

783
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Historic experimental place

784
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
the visiting scholar

785
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Then he tested

786
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Digestive acid content in different places

787
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
10 meters measured once

788
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
10 meters measured once

789
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
wow you can see

790
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
it changes quickly

791
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
very big

792
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
big change

793
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The difference in concentration can be as much as 10,000 times

794
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
then what to do

795
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Plants face such a changing environment

796
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,600
how does it cope

797
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,100
So plants have two absorption systems

798
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,000
an absorption system called high compatibility

799
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,340
One is a low clearance absorption system

800
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,240
Well, you can see that it's increasing in concentration and it's getting higher

801
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,700
When it is high, it is saturated, and it will no longer increase

802
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,000
Later the second system started again

803
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,040
raised when the taller

804
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,240
So what is the function of this high-low compatibility?

805
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,240
low clearance you can see

806
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,400
When the concentration outside is high

807
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,000
It can absorb a large amount of digestate

808
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,400
and save it quickly

809
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,900
Can be used again in the future

810
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,600
So what is high compatibility?

811
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,000
Just after the rain washes away

812
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Soil's depleting salt flow is running out

813
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,440
The plant still uses the system

814
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,000
I tried my best to find a way to get rid of the last drop of salt

815
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,500
inhale again

816
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
This is the difference between the two systems

817
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,840
A high-compatibility, a low-compatibility action system

818
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,100
That

819
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,200
Plants also happen to have a lot of protein responsible for absorbing

820
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,000
There is a group of proteins called NRT2

821
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,800
The mouth jar we just mentioned belongs to this

822
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,000
For a long time we thought it was low light and sexual

823
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Then one day a master student

824
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,600
In fact, he was still a college student at that time.

825
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,000
he found out about it

826
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,400
It is actually a very special protein

827
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,200
it is a double light and sex

828
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,500
That is to say, it has two functions

829
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
It can also do high light and sexual absorption

830
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Can also do low light and sex absorbing

831
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So far probably only this protein

832
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,500
have such characteristics

833
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,700
It uses spiritual acidification to switch between high and low

834
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,000
when what is spiritual acidification

835
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Protein is often added with a spiritual acid

836
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
When the protein is added with a spiritual acid

837
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
it becomes recharge

838
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the whole structure will change

839
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So it relies on protein acidification

840
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Turn it into a high light and sex transporter

841
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,500
When there is no spiritual acidification

842
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,000
It is a low light and sensitive transporter

843
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
this is where we are

844
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Do a functional test of it to see something like this

845
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
ok so how does it absorb next

846
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
today's little question

847
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I just want to say how about the plants

848
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Calculation of minor salts in soil

849
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That animal is not the same as a plant

850
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
animal in danger

851
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
what's the first reaction

852
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
run

853
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Survive the fastest

854
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The genetic selection of that evolution

855
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Probably run the fastest and keep it

856
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
what about the plants

857
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Plants can't escape

858
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So I say plants are the bravest

859
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
people who face problems

860
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
it never escapes its problems

861
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
it has only one choice

862
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
face it, deal with it

863
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Where does the oilseed vegetable stone fall and where does it grow

864
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
How to make use of its existing environment

865
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
do your best exercise

866
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,640
this is the plant

867
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,880
So he must have the highest courage

868
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,340
also have wisdom

869
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,640
what kind of wisdom

870
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,180
He must be very sensitive to detect

871
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,980
changes in his external environment

872
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,340
One of them is sulfonate

873
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,000
The amount of salt

874
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,140
he wants to know

875
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,840
he can prepare

876
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,080
This is plant sulphate sucked in

877
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,800
How to use a picture

878
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
good

879
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
good

880
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:39,840
The cells of this plant are

881
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,100
There is a cell membrane just mentioned

882
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,460
Cell membranes can absorb siolate

883
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,300
suck in

884
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,740
After Xiao Yan was inhaled

885
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,640
Shallite will be reduced by a Shallate Coal

886
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,660
converted to nitrite

887
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
Where is Ya Xiao Salt?

888
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,340
Then send it to the karmic body of the plant

889
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,140
Coal reduction through nitrite

890
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,440
convert to acetate

891
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,340
and then send

892
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,140
incobarate and then synthesize

893
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,940
manufacture amino acids

894
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,480
Then we can grow

895
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,940
So actually

896
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,220
I just said that half of the human body

897
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,180
Eggs are from Harvard

898
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,780
In fact, the half is synthesized by this method

899
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,660
Because we humans cannot absorb small salts

900
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,900
with salt

901
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,300
We can only absorb organic eggs

902
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
organic egg worker

903
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,300
who can transform the inorganic into organic

904
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,540
just plants

905
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,380
so your plant

906
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,940
those egg workers

907
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,140
Actually 100%

908
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,140
almost one hundred percent

909
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,140
not here directly or indirectly

910
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,740
the meat you eat

911
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,020
it also eats plants

912
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,780
end up eating plants

913
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,260
so rely on this method

914
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,660
to convert inorganic into organic

915
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,620
in order to supply the growth of the whole animal

916
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,900
animal egg worker needs

917
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,860
Okay, what about the plants?

918
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,400
Just mentioned, you see it can actually use hydrochloric acid

919
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,400
You can also use saddle salt directly

920
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,400
It is actually more convenient to use saddle salt directly

921
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,900
You see it is missing two

922
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,900
But saddle salt is actually very stressful and toxic to plants.

923
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Because of acid reduction... that saddle salt is in...

924
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,900
There is no way to store it in plants for a long time

925
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
So as soon as the plant sees the saddle salt

926
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,900
got freaked out because it's going to metabolize it right away.

927
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,400
then metabolizing it costs energy

928
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
What about the hydrochloric acid?

929
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,100
it... the good thing about it is that it can store

930
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,100
it can store it inside the vacuole

931
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,400
But it takes two more abilities to digest the salt...

932
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,600
energy to metabolize it

933
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
So plants don't want to...

934
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,500
When you are free, prepare these enzymes first

935
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,400
It needs to see, eh, is there really any disinfectant outside?

936
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,400
I just went... I just picked it up

937
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,100
And just like that... like that...

938
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,800
You have to do the math to see how much it was before this month

939
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Just decided whether to eat steak or eat today...

940
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,760
Eat that Yangchun noodles like this

941
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,240
So he has to see the changes outside to know

942
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,520
So plants do

943
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,080
Salt is not only a nutrient

944
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,120
Still a fast-moving mob

945
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,280
He wants to know that plants can know

946
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,800
How much salt content

947
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,520
to change its own growth

948
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,400
For example, if there is plenty in the early stage

949
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,800
It can grow it better like this

950
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,000
so grow

951
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
planted dormancy

952
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,280
air hole switch

953
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,280
growth of leaves

954
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,840
even what i just said

955
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,280
just metabolized

956
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,240
The genes involved in the metabolism of salt

957
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,480
gene expression

958
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,680
are regulated by sulphate

959
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,000
That's actually

960
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,720
this reaction

961
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,360
what we call the primary response

962
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
Primary Nitrous Bounce

963
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,640
This is a response to the expression of a gene

964
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,960
For example, those genes just now

965
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,280
or the genes responsible for the uptake here

966
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,040
We get as an example

967
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,000
It's when you have amine inflammation

968
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,200
very low performance

969
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,800
When giving it antiaciditis

970
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,840
The performance reached the top in 30 minutes and then fell

971
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
quick response

972
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,080
So we call it touch response

973
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,960
very fast

974
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,360
We've known this reaction since 1989

975
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,480
It's like saying 20 years ago

976
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,880
Know it 25 years ago

977
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,840
have this reaction

978
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,720
know the reaction

979
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,400
everyone is thinking

980
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,200
Plants Known to Support Undo Aciditis

981
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,600
how to detect

982
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,440
Who is in charge of detecting

983
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,320
this is what we are all looking for

984
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
we are also looking for

985
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,320
So I use this poem to

986
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,160
tell us how to find it

987
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,840
It is re-li Xunla ten thousand degrees

988
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,680
look back

989
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,800
That man is at the burning mountain

990
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,680
we didn't expect

991
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,840
early morning

992
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,080
It turned out to be our laboratory

993
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,160
I've been doing this protein

994
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,320
Just to know how charcoal cures external acid inflammation

995
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,280
how much protein

996
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,520
So it is not only a

997
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,200
Transport protein transports hydrochloric acid from the outside of the cell to the inside of the cell

998
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,400
it's also a sensor

999
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,360
Sensing external acid salts

1000
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,560
At this time, there is no need to put the cells

1001
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,440
Just a little bit of it can regenerate gene expression

1002
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,320
I just said that he is a heavy female patroller.

1003
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,400
look back

1004
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,520
That man is at the burning mountain

1005
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,840
Looking back on this smoke

1006
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,520
It sounds like only looking back

1007
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,160
In fact, this process is ups and downs

1008
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,640
How to find this gene

1009
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,520
how to let us know

1010
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,840
indeed he

1011
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,880
that's actually

1012
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,720
the story goes so

1013
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,280
we were thinking then

1014
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,920
we all know this reaction

1015
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,160
Participating molecules

1016
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,480
we are all looking

1017
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,320
don't know who

1018
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,840
then we will

1019
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,720
found a protein gene

1020
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,160
Protein gene is what I just said

1021
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,280
he will add protein

1022
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,840
An enzyme of lingonic acid root

1023
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,400
One of the genes CIPK8 we found

1024
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,400
At that time I wanted to say

1025
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,200
is he involved in this

1026
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,240
Primary reaction of antiaciditis

1027
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,440
found out that he was indeed involved

1028
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,440
for normal plants

1029
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,440
When he gave 25 minimolar of antiacid inflammation

1030
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,040
His performance can be like this

1031
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,800
But when the CIPK8

1032
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,160
lower

1033
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,200
then we thought

1034
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,000
Wow, great

1035
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,040
We find the first gene involved in this process

1036
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
Then we feel good about ourselves

1037
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,880
The paper will be sent to PNS

1038
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,000
Then the paper is sent to CIPK8S

1039
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,440
I also breathed a sigh of relief

1040
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,000
Hurry up and take the kids to Hualien for vacation

1041
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,080
Then I go to the ideal land to go on vacation

1042
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,080
Then the door to my room opened

1043
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,840
the phone rang

1044
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,480
paper was rejected

1045
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,000
Our kind of paper is often rejected

1046
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,560
And having a dream is actually a way to do research.

1047
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,760
that's good

1048
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,240
Then my students were about to cry

1049
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,920
Because he is waiting for a graduation

1050
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,480
Going to America to be a Poster

1051
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,440
His whole plan is fine

1052
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440
just wait here

1053
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,160
Hurry up how to accept this

1054
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,800
then i will say

1055
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,720
what did the other party say

1056
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,120
He said the other party said

1057
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,320
The difference is too small

1058
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,560
I think the difference is too small

1059
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,320
our gold

1060
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,720
Such a beautiful experiment proves that he has a difference

1061
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,960
But he said the difference is too small

1062
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,320
The difference is too small is this

1063
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,600
traits of this gene

1064
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,320
how can i change

1065
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,080
Ruined

1066
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:30,640
I just say

1067
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,480
At that time the child was in the room

1068
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,200
I said I'll wait for half an hour

1069
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,040
wait for me for half an hour

1070
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,240
I'll call back

1071
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,560
What am I doing for half an hour?

1072
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,160
Chase the little ones to the pool

1073
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,760
you have been to the ideal land

1074
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,360
swimming pool outside the room

1075
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,440
So I sent the kids to the pool

1076
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,200
rush to the swimming pool

1077
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,400
I have time to think what to do

1078
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,960
only then did i think

1079
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,280
ask him to do an experiment

1080
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,040
This is the following experiment

1081
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,680
we just test

1082
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,840
i told him to do it

1083
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,320
call him in half an hour

1084
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,320
I will ask him to test

1085
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,500
highest performance

1086
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Then I found out that

1087
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
Wow

1088
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,360
WireTab is just like the absorption just now

1089
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,040
Also two Faces

1090
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,960
There are two modes of action, high and low

1091
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,240
Just CIPK8

1092
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,360
Only in the place of Lower Fini

1093
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,040
So this data

1094
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,120
Let this student Paper

1095
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,360
send out to accept

1096
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,040
Of course I dare not use 4PS

1097
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,560
Send it to another Jono at this time

1098
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,640
accepted students graduated

1099
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,560
but tell me

1100
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,080
Wow

1101
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,520
This mouth must be involved

1102
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,280
We must be involved with that transfer protein

1103
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,200
So this experiment

1104
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,360
In fact let me start to know that

1105
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,960
Extraoral involvement

1106
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,280
So sometimes I see Paper

1107
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,920
being traveled is sometimes

1108
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,440
crisis is opportunity

1109
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,240
not on that knot

1110
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,160
I probably have no way of convincing students to do this experiment

1111
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,640
this experiment is really hard

1112
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,440
Actually so far

1113
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,800
There are not many people in our laboratory

1114
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,200
Really dare to challenge this experiment

1115
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,440
then we find out

1116
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The mouth-wrist mutant's response hit rock bottom

1117
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,500
This leads us to say that the mouth and wrist are likely involved

1118
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,000
But we don't know that the evidence isn't enough

1119
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,500
Another breakthrough is that we found a

1120
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,000
A mutant that isolates the function of uptake sensing

1121
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
it can't absorb

1122
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But the message transmission is still normal

1123
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,500
This shows that it is directly involved in

1124
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,000
With this evidence we can explain

1125
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,500
This wrist is what we have been looking for for more than 20 years

1126
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,000
Who the hell is sensing these soils

1127
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,500
Content of fermented salt

1128
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,500
So I drew this picture

1129
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Said the wrist is like a tongue

1130
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Help plants know in the soil

1131
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,500
wow! is this delicious for dinner today

1132
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,500
how does it taste today

1133
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
then i will find one

1134
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
artist painted

1135
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,000
At that time, if the competition

1136
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,500
Sale,Jono's cover

1137
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,160
but you i failed

1138
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,600
Sale has no vision

1139
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,100
That cover is really enough

1140
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,060
like a notebook cover

1141
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,600
air element

1142
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,800
there is another funny thing

1143
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,400
Once at an international conference

1144
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,000
i will tell the story

1145
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,300
Then show this slide

1146
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,700
this slide

1147
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,400
then i said

1148
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,700
This turns white like a tongue

1149
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,200
I'm probing... probing that brain

1150
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,000
Then the next speaker is a

1151
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,100
people from france

1152
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,900
Then he also spoke on the same subject

1153
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,500
similar topics

1154
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,700
But what did he draw?

1155
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,600
draw a dog's nose

1156
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,900
so he said

1157
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,200
Chinese people use their tongues

1158
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,300
Come to discover the deliciousness of his food

1159
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,900
We French smell food with our noses

1160
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,200
Hehehe

1161
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,600
good

1162
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,200
Then today one is to say

1163
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,000
How is food calculated?

1164
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
The content of antiacid in the soil

1165
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
well, plants count

1166
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
One, two, three outside

1167
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
One outside, two, three, ten

1168
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
How does it know whether there is more or less outside?

1169
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
just use the wrist

1170
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Because just said there are two kinds of oral and wrist

1171
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
The ability to grasp antiacid inflammation lightly and firmly

1172
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So when the concentration is low outside

1173
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
it will be acidified

1174
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
When the concentration outside is high

1175
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
it won't acidify

1176
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
So it counts by mouth and wrist

1177
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Is the concentration outside high or low?

1178
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
When the outside concentration is low

1179
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It will be Binding on a high-resolution position

1180
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Just posted this Fossuration again

1181
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
When the mouth and wrist are acidified

1182
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
It's a high-complexity transsclerostin

1183
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
then this time

1184
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It also issued a relatively low amount of elite performance

1185
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
When the concentration outside is relatively low

1186
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,160
When the output is very high, he is three good, he does not want to do anything

1187
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,960
ad hoc

1188
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,000
At this time, he is a low-light and sexual transporter

1189
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,600
A transport protein that can be absorbed in large quantities

1190
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,360
At this time, he can also express a high amount of genes

1191
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,200
So the mouth and the wrist are really quality

1192
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,760
He is the porter who moved Xiao Chuanyuan in from the outside

1193
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,360
He's in the goalie, just said look outside

1194
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,160
Uncle look outside

1195
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,440
He's also a messenger of messages.

1196
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,400
He also needs to flush this message into the nucleus

1197
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,520
to make genes behave like this

1198
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,880
This is how the plant calculates the concentration change outside

1199
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,400
Next, how do plants remember the concentration changes outside?

1200
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,800
My use of memory is actually a bit anthropomorphic

1201
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,160
It really means that the plant is actually like this little white rabbit

1202
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:53,680
where did this little white rabbit come from

1203
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,680
Ellie is the one in Sleepwalking

1204
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,600
Little rabbit, he is not too late to get one of these

1205
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,460
He's been with him for a long time

1206
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,660
How does he calculate the time to change the time?

1207
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,000
what is time change

1208
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,660
Actually it is like this

1209
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,860
We just talked about the expression of those genes

1210
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,620
we saw shortly

1211
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,860
His mark is to give him 25 minimum high concentration time

1212
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,460
he raises

1213
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,060
But after reaching the peak he comes down

1214
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,260
Still low at 16 hours

1215
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,820
And what if you give him a low dose?

1216
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,100
Although the bid was not high when he just died

1217
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,660
after a short down

1218
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,460
he went up

1219
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,060
That is to say, the concentration in the short-term and long-term

1220
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,860
would be totally different and the opposite reaction

1221
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,060
why is it so complicated

1222
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,900
Why long time vs short time concentration

1223
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,900
would have a completely different reaction

1224
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,300
This actually works with

1225
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:55,060
A picture from this dragon plant physiology textbook to represent

1226
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,900
It was also mentioned just now

1227
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,660
The higher the concentration the plants can grow

1228
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,260
But after a concentration

1229
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,800
Actually it won't increase much anymore

1230
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,680
Even when the concentration is too high

1231
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,180
plant growth will decrease

1232
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,040
So too much is actually not good for plants.

1233
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,040
So the opposite reaction just now

1234
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,840
It is an adjustment function

1235
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,280
But when the concentration outside is high

1236
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,080
It cannot be insatiable and still

1237
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,520
it can't take it

1238
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,360
So it tries to turn it off

1239
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,040
when it's low outside

1240
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,040
It says I'm still starving

1241
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,480
not enough not enough

1242
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,120
But plants know how to say

1243
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,720
how long has it been starving

1244
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,200
How to do this kind of time change?

1245
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,400
We found that there is a

1246
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,680
I just talked about acidifying it

1247
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,000
The other is an effect of deleaching and acidifying it

1248
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,600
protein delynchase

1249
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,600
we named it

1250
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,400
And he actually works differently in the short term than in the long term.

1251
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,000
He was a good guy when he was short

1252
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,400
He can help this protein gene plum go pro-acidifying mouth tank

1253
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,000
but for a long time

1254
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,500
He in turn does a complete opposite

1255
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,400
Removed the acid root

1256
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,800
So he short time and long time

1257
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,000
playing two completely different roles

1258
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,400
Such a role reversal makes gene expression low for a short time

1259
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Long time is high performance

1260
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,400
The gene named him Anny

1261
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,400
In fact, the name is very interesting

1262
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,400
I don't know if you watch Star Wars or not

1263
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Not a Skywalker in Star Wars

1264
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
He was a chivalrous man

1265
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,800
Later, it was due to personality defects

1266
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Finally turned around and became a bad guy

1267
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,800
So I use him to mean Anny

1268
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,400
Anny is the name

1269
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,200
this protein

1270
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,460
It does the exact opposite of what it does in the short run versus the long run

1271
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,660
Let the plants do the time change

1272
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,800
This is to tell you how plants know

1273
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,500
Concentration change, how to do time change

1274
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:20,000
Alright, next this is the hydrochloric acid out there

1275
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,800
What about the hydrochloric acid in plants?

1276
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,760
How to know the digestate in plants?

1277
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,760
In fact, it needs to know whether there are many outside

1278
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,260
You also need to know if there is enough storage in it.

1279
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,960
it can do the best conditioning

1280
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,760
How do you know inside?

1281
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,560
We found that there is a gene that is responsible for detecting

1282
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,760
Well, this gene is called NRT1.13

1283
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,760
Where does it manifest itself?

1284
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,160
Apex, we know that this plant is from the Arabian kingdom

1285
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,260
leaves grow under it

1286
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,860
When the leaves grow for a while and are old enough

1287
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,060
The Arab world will smoke this flower shaft

1288
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,760
What about after pulling this flower shaft?

1289
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,660
this plant

1290
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
This internode will grow a leaf

1291
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Come here again and it will bloom

1292
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
There is a flower stalk coming out

1293
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So this section

1294
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
In fact like one of its plants

1295
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
checkpoint

1296
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It needs to know how to redistribute nutrients

1297
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Then the gene is expressed in this

1298
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
knot this place

1299
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
what about this knot

1300
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And it just happens to grow out

1301
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
The place where the test capital will grow

1302
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
The gene behaves like this

1303
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
What is this gene involved in?

1304
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
first it controls the net

1305
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The amount of hydrochloric acid that moves sideways

1306
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Where is the expression of this gene?

1307
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Plants are delivered from wooden cloth

1308
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
so this plant

1309
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Wooden cloth is this cell

1310
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Later I will talk more about what is wood cloth

1311
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Actually a plant

1312
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
imagine a

1313
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,600
dead water pipe from root to above ground

1314
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,600
After nutrients are absorbed from the roots

1315
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,520
transport from the xylem to the aboveground

1316
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,960
The plant sent a guard to stand next to the xylem

1317
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,240
check it out

1318
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,600
What is the content of silver pinate in the xylem

1319
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,800
This pawn is just this 1.13

1320
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,600
standing right inside the cell next to the xylem

1321
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,880
green cells

1322
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,320
Let's look at how high the silver pinionate content is in the xylem

1323
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,520
the first to regulate

1324
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,400
How far should I send it to the side?

1325
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,480
also regulates its flowering

1326
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,920
When it is broken, it is found that it blooms later than normal plants

1327
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:54,960
And this effect is not affected when the concentration outside is very high

1328
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,840
Differences are only seen at low concentrations

1329
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,080
This gene is too low when measuring speed over there

1330
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,620
Find a way to get the plants ready

1331
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:09,760
Come to the quilt master to get up to make it bloom again

1332
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,460
Without this quilt master

1333
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,500
I can't flower normally.

1334
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:20,200
It is even said that it will affect the growth of the measured capital

1335
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,100
Or the trees that measure capital like this

1336
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,000
So actually a plant

1337
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,660
you plant two plants

1338
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,960
Sometimes it looks different

1339
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,820
Measurements actually affect the shape of its entire plant

1340
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,520
There are many factors such as temperature and sunlight

1341
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,520
Nutrients also affect

1342
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,120
Xiao Suinyan is also a factor in controlling this French

1343
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,520
This is how Xiao Suanyan sensed

1344
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,720
I'm going to talk pretty fast

1345
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,220
But there's one more thing I'll talk about

1346
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:59,080
It's how plants are sucked in Xiao Suinyan

1347
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,080
how to deliver

1348
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:06,140
Make effective use of different parts

1349
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:10,760
ok , that we just talked about

1350
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,160
Except for a few that are sensing changes

1351
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,260
And some are actually shipping

1352
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,660
After the plant wasting inflammation is inhaled

1353
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,800
and deliver it efficiently

1354
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,920
Take advantage of where you really need it

1355
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,260
Then our laboratory also knows that

1356
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,120
the various steps involved

1357
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,620
Today, I will focus on these three genes

1358
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,980
It's doing some redistribution of wasting inflammation inside the blade

1359
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,580
ok , before i talk about this i ' ll talk about it

1360
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:47,500
Do you know how tall the tallest tree is?

1361
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,020
100 meters high

1362
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,860
This Ruiwu in California

1363
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,420
about 115 meters high

1364
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,020
About how high is this building? About a third of it

1365
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,200
101 building height

1366
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,900
Did you think of a fun question

1367
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,900
Our water will reach 30% of the building height

1368
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,360
how much horse power do we need to hit it up

1369
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,100
But plants don't need a little effort

1370
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,560
just send it up

1371
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,760
How did the water rush so high?

1372
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,260
For True Dispersion

1373
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,560
Why does True Dispersion have this magical power?

1374
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,520
Actually rely on this

1375
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,120
The true dispersion effect is dispersed in water

1376
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,780
is a plant within an hour

1377
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,260
Probably all the water needs to be changed once

1378
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,120
The water in its whole body needs to be changed once

1379
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,820
It's a waste to think about it, right?

1380
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:50,780
That's why agriculture needs so much water

1381
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,160
Then why does it have an advantage to use true dispersion

1382
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,460
It's actually sending us and you to fight under the sun

1383
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,360
Especially these days, you go to fight under the sun

1384
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,320
20 minutes is a bit unbearable without an umbrella

1385
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,400
Plant I told you it can't hide

1386
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,560
So it relies on this water to dissipate the heat

1387
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,720
Then why is the water pumped so high?

1388
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,800
The main thing is to say yes, after steaming this water and using it dry

1389
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:24,160
This is the cell, the cell inside the leaf

1390
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,840
We know that there is a thing in the plant cell called the leaf

1391
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,800
cell wall

1392
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,400
So the cell wall has very, very thin pores

1393
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,160
Come to think of it, there's water in those holes

1394
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,360
when the water disappears

1395
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,280
There is no water in this hole

1396
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,920
This creates a hollow when there is no water

1397
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,960
water becomes a hollow

1398
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,120
We just know water doesn't like cavities the last thing

1399
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:51,960
it tries to make it up again

1400
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,800
This power is the power it makes up for

1401
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,840
it wants to reduce it doesn't want to have a pit

1402
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,160
it's going to level it

1403
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,080
The force of this leveling is just

1404
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,880
Let it refer to the ability to draw water from the ground

1405
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,740
Rush up to 30 stories

1406
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,520
let it go up

1407
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,340
This path is called wooden steps

1408
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,880
The wooden steps seem to be very similar

1409
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,720
Plants are actually two highways

1410
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,240
a wooden step

1411
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,280
just said

1412
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,580
Use truth and goodness to flush it

1413
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,860
go take it

1414
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,420
Its source of power is the effect of truth and goodness

1415
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:33,540
Then the direction of common recitation is mainly from the root of the bottom all the way to the third step

1416
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,360
Then there is another way, the plug tube.

1417
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,400
Wooden step for cork

1418
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,960
It's a bit like our arteries and veins

1419
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,240
but

1420
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,560
The wooden step was just mentioned

1421
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,140
The plug tube is not the same as the wooden step

1422
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,920
it is a living cell

1423
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,000
it is a living cell

1424
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,780
but it is because

1425
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,100
it's a hollowed out living cell

1426
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,620
So its transportation can also be faster

1427
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,340
Normal cell delivery is too slow

1428
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,340
it's a hollowed out living cell

1429
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:05,100
But since it is a living cell

1430
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,940
Its delivery is mainly due to the difference in osmotic pressure

1431
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,240
So it will always be the most osmotic

1432
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,040
the most abundant place

1433
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,040
Send to places where material is relatively scarce

1434
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
And what is the most abundant place

1435
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,140
The inside of the plant is actually the place where photosynthesis is strongest

1436
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:27,140
Because sugar is the largest substance in plants

1437
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,880
So it's basically from where the photosynthesis is strongest

1438
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,880
sent to weaker places

1439
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,880
This is the xylem and cork

1440
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,880
that just said

1441
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,880
Those three genes are responsible for the redistribution of these ions

1442
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,880
Among them, 1.11 and 1.12

1443
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,880
It is responsible for saying the way to change the runway

1444
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,380
Transfers hydrochloric acid from mature large leaves to young leaves

1445
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:54,380
good

1446
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,380
what about the gene

1447
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:58,380
Well, we just talked about the ones from the ground

1448
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,380
it works by virtue

1449
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,040
Reaction

1450
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,840
What is the stronger effect of true dispersion?

1451
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,360
bigger leaves

1452
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,920
True Sancao is the strongest

1453
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,200
OK , so a whole lot of sate

1454
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,640
will run to large mature leaves

1455
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,800
At this time, its salt content is very high

1456
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,800
The young leaves have very low sulphate content

1457
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,480
Young people want to grow up, what should we do?

1458
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,520
It's...less salty

1459
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,840
What should we do at this time?

1460
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,640
It relies on the two transformation proteins 1.11 and 1.12

1461
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,400
in the sieve

1462
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,960
Make these more in...

1463
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,520
Salt conversion treasure road from xylem

1464
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,560
into the sieve

1465
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,920
What is the result of this?

1466
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,920
The amount of mature leaves sent in is reduced

1467
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,120
But take these salts

1468
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,840
Used to supplement the deficiency of young leaves

1469
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,480
So plants are smart

1470
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,480
it knows

1471
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,480
Hey, don't eat so much

1472
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,160
give young people something like this

1473
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,700
What is the effect of such a mechanism of action?

1474
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,560
Normal plants we just talked about

1475
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,800
The more egg fatters it grows, the bigger it grows

1476
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,200
it's a normal plant

1477
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,960
You give it 0.2 a little bit of egg nitrate

1478
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,360
it looks like this

1479
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,200
Here are the different blade sizes

1480
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,200
when we give it a high concentration

1481
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,360
it increases its output

1482
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,760
But this function is broken

1483
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,760
It has no way to have this growth

1484
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,920
So it's like talking about the mechanism of power

1485
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,480
reassignment mechanism

1486
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,720
for its high concentration

1487
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,520
Increased growth is an important mechanism

1488
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,080
So I just use this

1489
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,960
I also like to grow flowers at home occasionally

1490
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,760
It's hard for me to rethink long

1491
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,280
this plant is very interesting

1492
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,400
how funny is it

1493
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,680
as it is now green

1494
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,480
It turns red when the sun is strong

1495
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,680
so i find it funny

1496
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,680
i will cut it off

1497
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,280
Pull the fork again, let it take root and turn red

1498
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,140
Then I planted it in the ground

1499
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,600
I am also doing experiments on these three seeds when I go home.

1500
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,040
when i take it off

1501
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,640
It was probably these two leaves

1502
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,440
I left a big leaf for this one

1503
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,440
This is actually the same leaf as this

1504
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,340
do you see the difference

1505
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,440
this is their grandson

1506
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,340
This grandson has grown so big

1507
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,740
This grandson is still so young

1508
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,640
So it's different with grandma

1509
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,640
I want to say wow

1510
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:29,940
because when i saw this i thought

1511
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,800
I must take a picture and tell you the story

1512
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,100
That just goes to show

1513
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,500
Big leaves can grow small leaves

1514
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,500
You would imagine that the big leaf would eat his nutrients

1515
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:41,200
no he will help the little leaves grow

1516
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,980
So this is good proof

1517
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:46,100
I want to say wow this is my proof of theory

1518
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:48,880
exactly such a situation

1519
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,300
good

1520
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,580
That's a reassignment mechanism

1521
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,840
There is another mechanism for reassignment

1522
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,480
Mention here means

1523
01:05:58,800 --> 01:05:59,580
Xiao salt

1524
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,400
In addition to being metabolized

1525
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,400
there is another possibility

1526
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,400
It will be stored in the vacuole

1527
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,400
In fact, plant cells are very interesting

1528
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,400
Plant cells are actually filled with vacuoles

1529
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,800
It's all vacuoles

1530
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,800
Probably the cytoplasm is sieved to a very small size

1531
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,200
then they

1532
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,400
Xiao acid inflammation can be stored in the vacuole

1533
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,200
In fact, they say that inside your plant

1534
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,200
For example, now people often say that there is

1535
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,300
Water and plants contain too much acid

1536
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,700
So they say before eating vegetables

1537
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:30,900
It's better to test whether the amount of Xiao Suinyan is enough

1538
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,100
In fact, when you measure

1539
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,100
What does Xiao Suinyan measure?

1540
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:36,000
The test is the Xiao acid inflammation in the vacuole

1541
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,500
Vacuole

1542
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,900
The vacuole is it's a storage place for it

1543
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,100
Vacuoles are fun

1544
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,100
The vacuole is the plant's storage room

1545
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,100
also a trash can

1546
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,900
Throw it in where it doesn't want

1547
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,800
It has to be stored and thrown in

1548
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,500
in this way

1549
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,400
That

1550
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,300
Xiao Suanyan also threw it in

1551
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,400
Actually they said

1552
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,700
corn did

1553
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,600
they say corn yields

1554
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,300
In fact, it has to do with its ability to store

1555
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,460
it needs to be able to store

1556
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,200
and move it out efficiently

1557
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,600
hugging is important

1558
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,100
then we just mentioned

1559
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,540
another 1.7

1560
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:12,660
Is responsible for grabbing out the storage

1561
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,160
a place to repurpose

1562
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,200
I just said that when the concentration was high outside

1563
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,660
It uses the two golds of 1.11 and 1.12

1564
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:21,760
send it to young night piece

1565
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,760
When there is no anti-inflammatory outside

1566
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,560
how to feed that young man

1567
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:28,860
he thought

1568
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:32,060
Lao Ye still has some Xiao Chang Yan stored there

1569
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:33,560
just that night movie

1570
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,220
There's still some left in that night cannon.

1571
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,220
So he starts another posture at this time

1572
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,820
1.7

1573
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,020
he is in laoye

1574
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,360
just the biggest night movie

1575
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,320
earthquake eternal strongest

1576
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,760
Lao Ye is now

1577
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,120
Old leaves remove excess inflammation

1578
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,080
Also by plugging the pipe

1579
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,320
this highway

1580
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,120
sent him to young night slices

1581
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,580
to make him grow

1582
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,240
good

1583
01:07:58,740 --> 01:07:59,740
good so

1584
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,960
The mechanism of action is different from that

1585
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,200
it is outside when concentrations are low

1586
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,600
In case there is no way to use the stored

1587
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,160
Sure enough, the concentration outside and the lack of eggs outside

1588
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,200
It can't grow well

1589
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:18,960
That means you're out of pocket.

1590
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,600
You can't hurry up and get the money out of the bank

1591
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,560
you are probably hungry

1592
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,560
So this mechanism is to allow it to transfer the bank's money

1593
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,600
Hurry up and get it out again, you can use it

1594
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,760
So you can see the two mechanisms

1595
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,800
In fact, the same output is to find a way to protect the youngest leaves

1596
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,080
make it grow well

1597
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,960
But a different mechanism is activated

1598
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,080
one they send is different

1599
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,920
This is from the root

1600
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,920
That is to say, when the concentration outside is high

1601
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,040
It starts this 1.11 and 1.12

1602
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,960
Let it do the transformation, let it attack the tender leaves

1603
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,120
But when there is nothing about 1.7 outside

1604
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
He tried to find a way to capture the old business of storage.

1605
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,500
to feed the young leaves

1606
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,000
So these two methods are trying to find a way to feed the young leaves

1607
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,500
then you want to say

1608
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,300
But he has to grow himself

1609
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,000
why is he feeding young leaves

1610
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,500
Actually, I'm going to tell the story about the oldest tree.

1611
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,000
you know it's the oldest tree

1612
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
4700 year old tree

1613
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
then he was alive

1614
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Looks like there are no leaves, he's still alive

1615
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
In fact, this 4,700-year-old tree

1616
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
They said that when the Golden Branch Pagoda was built

1617
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
he is a thousand years old

1618
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
why plants live so long

1619
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's the same as the chess piece I just mentioned

1620
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
His own survival is not important

1621
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Actually you see this cell

1622
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Not 4700 year old cells

1623
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
he is actually his

1624
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It is his descendants who are shrunk through

1625
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
so his young leaves are his offspring

1626
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,200
That's why he tried his best

1627
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,400
exhaustion strategy

1628
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,720
Try to send the most nutrients to the young leaves

1629
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,560
use this old tree to tell you

1630
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,240
Why do plants have such a design

1631
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,240
In fact, he is trying to find a way to live to at least 4000 water

1632
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,600
he wishes he still had a part

1633
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,840
So the plant actually has a lot of old cells dead.

1634
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,960
But his whole life is maintained

1635
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,560
He is not the same as the animal design

1636
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,400
Your plants are infinitely reproducible

1637
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,360
And the growth of plants is unlimited

1638
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,000
it can...

1639
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,200
It has that reproductive you can...

1640
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,600
you basically go from the shadows when

1641
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,640
just decide your two hands

1642
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,360
You won't grow three hands again

1643
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,760
different plants

1644
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,640
Its branch can play infinitely

1645
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,400
Because the outside environment is different

1646
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,960
do all the play

1647
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,440
Those few experiments

1648
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,160
In fact, let us rewrite a sentence in the textbook

1649
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,960
what is it

1650
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,120
That is to say, I just said

1651
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,460
There are two pipes in the plant

1652
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,360
One is wooden cloth, the other is plug tube

1653
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,900
In fact, in the textbook

1654
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,200
a famous saying is

1655
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,280
Xiao Suinyan will only be transported inside the wooden cloth

1656
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,940
But the few genes we just

1657
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:16,140
There is also a 1.9 that I don’t have time to talk about

1658
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,980
In fact, they are all sealing, relying on sealing to transport

1659
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:21,580
And some envelopes, envelopes transport

1660
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,640
It has a great influence on the delivery of Xiao acid inflammation

1661
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,520
even affect the growth of plants

1662
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,660
So we rewritten Xiao Keshu's sentence

1663
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:28,520
should change it

1664
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,520
cloth from the ground up

1665
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:31,980
indeed wooden cloth

1666
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,020
But the plug is to let Xiao Suinyan redistribute

1667
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:37,780
a very important mechanism

1668
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,180
But also because we have to rewrite the sentence

1669
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:42,720
A classic quote from a textbook

1670
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,320
we also suffered

1671
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,620
because at first everyone

1672
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,020
Don't even believe our stuff

1673
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:49,320
told us to do better than others

1674
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,060
twice as many experiments to prove

1675
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,560
our theory was right

1676
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,260
But I believe that today

1677
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:56,160
In these three fits I think already

1678
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,000
write this sentence down

1679
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,060
ok today

1680
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,400
Today I speak a little fast, that's about it.

1681
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,240
The last possible thanks to the research team in our laboratory

1682
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:08,120
I probably wrote it just now

1683
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,240
A place for each job who does it

1684
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,640
And the support from Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Science and Technology

1685
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,040
And most importantly thank you all

1686
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,640
so late to listen

1687
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,640
Thanks

1688
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,000
that's brilliant

1689
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,880
I used to be the one who memorized that wrong church book concept

1690
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,600
Now it's an eye-opener

1691
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,120
This one is actually very important.

1692
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,400
I used to study zoology in Taiwan

1693
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,000
Mr. Cai is studying Botany

1694
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,120
Our Department of Zoology and Department of Plants are both managed by No. 1

1695
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,520
So we used to joke

1696
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,040
we all eat them

1697
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,120
animal eats pig

1698
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:51,920
result you see

1699
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,360
we are all eaten

1700
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,640
If plants could live to be 4,000 years old

1701
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,360
None of our animals live to be 4,000 years old

1702
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,720
But today is really exciting

1703
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:00,760
and

1704
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,340
This also tells us that a very in-depth scientific research

1705
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,140
How to overthrow the authoritative statement

1706
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:09,260
That is science is continuous progress

1707
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,460
That human wisdom is constantly accumulating

1708
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,840
The results of these researches are all his.

1709
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,540
Teacher Cai’s guidance is also done by colleagues in the laboratory

1710
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,440
pretty brilliant

1711
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,200
I am very happy to learn new knowledge after listening

1712
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:27,840
Well, now we still have some time to ask you some questions.

1713
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,600
I don't know if you have any questions to ask

1714
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:39,880
Am I here to ask a simple question that says

1715
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,080
So if we know that these genes may be related to

1716
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,560
this a delayed this

1717
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,600
Words related to the Suanyan lawsuit

1718
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,560
In agriculture, we may be within the scope of application

1719
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,740
what might be the benefit

1720
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,620
So I just wanted to say that actually

1721
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,820
There are two directions to increase the utilization efficiency of eggs

1722
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:05,300
One is when the egg fat is low

1723
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,460
it can grow well

1724
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:08,360
At this time it may be called

1725
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,360
It's just a function

1726
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,560
Strengthen it to utilize the stored anti-inflammatory

1727
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,120
In fact, their farmers are fat

1728
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,320
It's not like fertilizing every day

1729
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,360
It actually threw a lot of fertilizer into it.

1730
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,760
Then let it eat for a while and then add fertilizer

1731
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,960
So they actually have to be stored very quickly

1732
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,960
then let it flow

1733
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,960
so we can strengthen it this storage

1734
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,960
A word of ability to reuse

1735
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,960
may allow the plants to grow well

1736
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,960
it's a mechanism

1737
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,960
Or it can increase growth when egg fat is high

1738
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,960
At this time, I used the function of eleven eleven and twelve just now.

1739
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,960
so there is probably no way we can do a dozen birds

1740
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,960
just one way to solve it all

1741
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,960
It may be necessary to design low egg fat at different times

1742
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,960
There are different ways to use when egg fat is high

1743
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,960
good

1744
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
do you have any questions

1745
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Don't ask Mr. Cai today

1746
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
here first

1747
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
here's the green one press down

1748
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
on the microphone

1749
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Thank you, I am also very interested in agricultural applications

1750
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
just mentioned

1751
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
When the land was light

1752
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
seems to add one

1753
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
still lead me to forget

1754
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
if that's the case isn't it

1755
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
If, for example, a relatively flat disease

1756
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
inside the land

1757
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
but if its

1758
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
A still just talked about it

1759
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
if it is higher

1760
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
the agricultural production

1761
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
still available in

1762
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
under low circumstances

1763
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
same high yield

1764
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
so is that so

1765
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
actually

1766
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Dan Lin Jia balance is the best

1767
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
you have one more

1768
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
it can't take advantage of

1769
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
so they have to balance

1770
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
well balanced

1771
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
that so

1772
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
just said

1773
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,760
He said that the ground egg fertilizer needs egg and armor

1774
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,560
In fact, no matter how low or high

1775
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,520
You have to match enough

1776
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,400
That zero heel

1777
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,400
it can grow normally

1778
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,900
Just now you talked about a low-definition joint force

1779
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:13,400
yes

1780
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,400
That is the Qingheli

1781
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,100
That's not a problem with Egg Zero

1782
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,120
It's antiacid

1783
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,520
Low-definition joint force and advanced

1784
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,520
zero egg

1785
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,020
right

1786
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,020
zero acidification

1787
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,920
Zero Acidification Is Another Thing

1788
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,920
that is a protein modification

1789
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:28,520
content with zero

1790
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,020
In fact, it is not so directly related.

1791
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,820
that is a protein modification

1792
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,820
The modification of the protein

1793
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,320
Could it be related to the content of zero?

1794
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,120
should not be so directly related

1795
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,420
In fact, the content of zero should be enough

1796
01:16:44,420 --> 01:16:45,720
do this thing

1797
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,420
Zero actually has other places

1798
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:50,420
there will be a shortage

1799
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:50,920
OK

1800
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:54,420
not because of

1801
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,420
there is a problem here

1802
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,620
the question i just asked

1803
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:57,920
I told that lady just now

1804
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,320
a little bit like

1805
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,220
because of ourselves

1806
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,200
I'm growing vegetables, I'm not a science guy

1807
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,000
the one who actually grows vegetables

1808
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
But I will find out that

1809
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,800
If I can actually activate the latter graph

1810
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,000
Because just now there are two pictures

1811
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,200
One picture is after adding the cake

1812
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,000
Immediately there will be a good growth effect

1813
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,800
but soon fell down

1814
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,800
The other one can start another

1815
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,800
slowly coming up

1816
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,800
Yes, but its later plateau effect

1817
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,200
would be better

1818
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:24,800
then we would think to say

1819
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,800
If so, the fat I added in front

1820
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,100
If this graph

1821
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,400
That is only a short-lived effect

1822
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,400
Then I might be quick, yes.

1823
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,400
but i can't

1824
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,200
If it grows for a long time

1825
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:36,900
Then maybe I can't achieve my effect

1826
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,100
Then the graph behind

1827
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,700
I can use a small amount of fertilizer

1828
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,100
But I can achieve better results

1829
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:44,000
If I say I hope to be able to achieve

1830
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,200
when this effect

1831
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,400
I can't figure it out yet

1832
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,900
teacher what you study

1833
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,000
How to combine it with our food

1834
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,600
Okay, you just answered earlier

1835
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,300
when it's a problem

1836
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,800
we do

1837
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,200
when planting

1838
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,900
I do it first in the land

1839
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:58,700
Basic fertilizer

1840
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,000
Just do soil improvement first

1841
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Manure, chicken manure, I made it first

1842
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Then after planting

1843
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I take a while and then start adding fertilizer

1844
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,000
So our current experience is not enough to judge

1845
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
I always ask people how long it takes to start adding

1846
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Is it liquid fertilizer or solid fertilizer?

1847
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
How long is the effect of liquid fertilizer? How long is the effect of solid fertilizer?

1848
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
But it feels like what the teacher heard tonight

1849
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
It seems that I can't cut it all at once.

1850
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Have you come to cut it up? Yes

1851
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
then i meant to say

1852
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
let me listen

1853
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Because Xiao Suanyan has been in the Grandfather Alliance

1854
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
They've been talking about this

1855
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
is a self-cancer factor

1856
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
what about the people we are planting

1857
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I can think about how to mix my fertilizer

1858
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
or how to get wet in time

1859
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
or control over dosage

1860
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Can achieve the effect that the teacher wants to say

1861
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
able to produce that output and quality

1862
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
but i don't want to have

1863
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
For example, Xiao acid inflammation over treatment

1864
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
participate in the plant

1865
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
or the problem of loss in nature

1866
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Well actually I just said

1867
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I heard someone say that actually a lot

1868
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,080
Do a lot of bad things for a while

1869
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,080
yes

1870
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,880
In fact, it is a water trafficker

1871
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,680
pay less, give slowly

1872
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:08,680
but

1873
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,000
It's a waste of time, right?

1874
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,840
Because the announcement did not go in

1875
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:15,200
Go find the announcement and do the strength work

1876
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,440
that's a problem

1877
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:17,640
if we can

1878
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,840
Therefore, Tang Wanjin's private lending

1879
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,960
Fertilizers are sometimes slow consumption

1880
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,880
flow out slowly

1881
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,880
So this slow consumption

1882
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,360
It is actually a comparison

1883
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,480
complex fertilizer

1884
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:29,240
make it easy to go

1885
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,120
that graded fertilizer

1886
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,360
Grading slowly

1887
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,040
That's actually

1888
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,600
no matter how slow it is too late

1889
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,400
it will

1890
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,440
will grow fast

1891
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,320
Then you just mentioned

1892
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,800
we can only control us

1893
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,640
Eat the amount of product you want to eliminate

1894
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,600
Well, you can try it

1895
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,520
at different times of day

1896
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,680
Consumer Products Let's do it another day

1897
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,760
I was told it was

1898
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,280
Help manage consumer products

1899
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:57,600
should be

1900
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,080
But in fact, life in Taiwan is long

1901
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:04,080
more funny

1902
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,360
so

1903
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,940
it will be really tiring

1904
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:13,140
do you think this is the way to act

1905
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,440
because there's another joke

1906
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,440
it's us

1907
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,840
because we are smiles

1908
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,940
if you don't call

1909
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,640
Sometimes someone else steals you

1910
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,240
In fact, there is a concern

1911
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,680
Because the plant that lives at night

1912
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,940
If you don't have it, it's not easy to save

1913
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:29,240
just let the body feel

1914
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,240
I like this

1915
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,000
so

1916
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
it's hard

1917
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:35,980
But because doing is not dynamic

1918
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,780
so it's kind of strategic

1919
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,880
I mean, actually you have to check the time in the morning too.

1920
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,780
unless it's very very early in the afternoon

1921
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,140
Otherwise, it will be collected later

1922
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,640
If we strap it up

1923
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:48,480
Yes, it will be easier to get tired

1924
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:50,780
morning dish

1925
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,780
Take it because it gets hot

1926
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:53,540
if we charge

1927
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,740
If you want to receive 7 and then come and take it home

1928
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:58,380
After it gets hot, the coconut will be there soon

1929
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,020
actually some

1930
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,500
the more experienced stuff

1931
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,500
like i just said

1932
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,500
Yellowing occurs when eggs are absent

1933
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,200
or start hard

1934
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,400
if you have enough experience

1935
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,500
You might be able to use these factors to climb out

1936
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,700
it is missing egg in it

1937
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,300
of course

1938
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,600
I once had someone talk to

1939
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,400
let the food tell you it's missing eggs

1940
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,700
Then there are also people who are doing experiments like this

1941
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,200
What you are doing now is actually lack of water.

1942
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,500
Actually because of water

1943
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,700
water is also a factor

1944
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:32,200
it's gonna give it a finish or something

1945
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,100
so when it lacks water

1946
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,900
there will be a green

1947
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:37,700
let you see the colors

1948
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,000
This is the kind of slippery

1949
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
So someone was thinking about this method

1950
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
but i think

1951
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,100
or realistically don't go

1952
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,100
Everyone has another question

1953
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,000
Dr. Cai

1954
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,700
Because this speech can be heard

1955
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,600
It's a pity for Dr. Cai

1956
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,200
We now have more practical questions from the audience

1957
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,200
It's a serious meal today

1958
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,700
we ate this today

1959
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Everyone wants to buy an organic one

1960
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
OK that one is not allowed

1961
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Some people on the Internet say that water and juice are bothersome

1962
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
What does he learn from others to guarantee?

1963
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
organic failure

1964
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
But he still can't eat

1965
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I still feel dangerous

1966
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I responded with

1967
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's like just talking about water and juice

1968
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
He still needs to protect the glue in the water

1969
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
It's like the one that just took a picture of me being honest

1970
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I still hold you and eat alone

1971
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
In fact, I recently said that I would help you provide

1972
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
so that

1973
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
This is not the case, in fact, this is not drinkable

1974
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I think it's good to try

1975
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
not too high

1976
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Actually don't be too...

1977
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,000
still eat alone

1978
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I don't know

1979
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
for sure

1980
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
In fact, traffic actors will pick it up

1981
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But everyone is too all reaction

1982
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
horse british

1983
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
In fact, traffic actors are going to be big

1984
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Traffic actor enters into the body

1985
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
he can also be in the body

1986
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
at the scene

1987
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
So the right amount of community is solidarity is OK

1988
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It's not that everyone is participating

1989
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
each roughly first

1990
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
so

1991
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Great amount for your facility

1992
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and often eat

1993
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
occasionally followed by

1994
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
brother is delicious

1995
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
For example, I went to follow

1996
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Internet people they are eating

1997
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
that

1998
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Ma Dongxie

1999
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
will suck

2000
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
miss children

2001
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
that's all good food

2002
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
so equivalent to

2003
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
good water will flow

2004
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
will be great

2005
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
that's a lot

2006
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
but i usually

2007
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
probably won't affect

2008
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,500
Adults think of children when they eat

2009
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,500
Give me a hug, I still don’t have a car to eat

2010
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,540
Ask Dean

2011
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,260
The movie that teaches the teacher to laugh is �나

2012
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:27,100
on the water with saw

2013
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,080
On the road is a well-known airport

2014
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,880
still early on the ground

2015
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,680
but i was surprised not to see

2016
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:35,280
Physically, this is the surface of the water

2017
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,580
lots of flattening

2018
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,680
that's it

2019
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,380
the elegant

2020
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:41,380
painted flat

2021
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:42,780
That is to say, the sandy water

2022
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:44,180
If it's just oily smoke

2023
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:45,980
you have to watch early

2024
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:46,280
right

2025
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,180
In fact, to be measured

2026
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,280
Oh flat

2027
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,580
Is it really slippery?

2028
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:50,980
Tuping also because it has two copies

2029
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,180
four cattle possible

2030
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,080
elegant water

2031
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,280
So in fact Tuping was very early

2032
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:54,680
right

2033
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:55,980
that's the time

2034
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:57,580
Death will probably be earlier together

2035
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:58,280
maximum

2036
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:58,780
painted flat

2037
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,080
because I saw

2038
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:07,580
Some people are over there, fishing casually there, it's so hard

2039
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:14,340
Many people seem to spend a lot of time, what are they doing?

2040
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:17,500
Others you cause this level of care

2041
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:23,940
I just said that because it has not absorbed people from the important places, it will go down

2042
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:27,640
from to level, from to elsewhere

2043
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:36,360
In fact, you see, the ditch next to the heavy foundation, sometimes we all say, you see the ditch

2044
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:42,920
So there is no way to prevent it, I just said not to pass the time

2045
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:45,360
Now people don't understand, don't waste time

2046
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:50,640
Then it is easier for me to think of a solution, and I will think about it in the rest of the time

2047
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Thanks

2048
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,600
OK, let's do it later

2049
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,000
thank you sir

2050
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Thank you so much Mayor, today I am a cat

2051
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:22,000
This one selling clothes is our export from Kelan

2052
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Is it called a temple in our two countries?

2053
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I've always been done, sometimes doing the same old things

2054
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Then, Yangmei just now, you know what it is

2055
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
NPK here today, you know I was originally

2056
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I'm not an easy expert

2057
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So it's too late for me to be today

2058
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
That's it, and NPK

2059
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
What crop are you looking at?

2060
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Then NPK needs to match, what is this?

2061
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
The organization to match is Unit A.

2062
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Then I only have a visit today

2063
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I used to be a high-speed flying pulse, I don't understand

2064
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
What is this output, what is this output?

2065
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
It was for your face

2066
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,500
Mostly Classroom Classroom Years

2067
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,300
is the classroom

2068
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,300
In fact, this contains the classroom

2069
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,800
In fact, many classrooms take the form of classrooms

2070
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,800
in the age of jurisprudence

2071
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,800
It is a classroom where strength can beat

2072
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,800
also very rich place

2073
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,800
For the Taiwan market

2074
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,300
I almost government the entire Taiwan market

2075
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,800
Exclusive loans are on the market

2076
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,800
Is it the only reason

2077
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,800
Moreover, the Taiwan Committee is ruled by law

2078
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,800
Taiwan committee members are also similar to us

2079
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,800
with american representatives

2080
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,800
science done

2081
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,800
So if we're going to step in

2082
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,800
I heard it's hard to do

2083
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,800
Actually there is another problem

2084
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,800
we also talk about

2085
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,800
The cultural position of Taiwan and the mainland

2086
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,800
government for agriculture

2087
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,800
easy replenishment is

2088
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
mention to others

2089
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
That's actually a very hurtful thing

2090
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,800
so that no comparison

2091
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,800
nest pressure problem

2092
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,800
current continent

2093
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,800
they also have

2094
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,800
this

2095
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,800
this is miserable

2096
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
it's a big chicken

2097
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Normally I might do something like this satellite

2098
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
it's a big chicken

2099
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
it's very very little frame

2100
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So make a market

2101
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
It's fine

2102
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
only in domestic countries

2103
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Chugoku University

2104
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
now it's like this

2105
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
that's what it sanctioned

2106
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
now also in the country

2107
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Special medical treatment will not

2108
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
thank you

2109
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
come here

2110
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
we also feel alike

2111
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
another report

2112
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
us

2113
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
To my own teacher here

2114
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
our own professor

2115
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Dr. Cai

2116
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
thank you

2117
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
very deep showing

2118
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Very interesting and wonderful presentation

2119
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
the layman who listened to me listened

2120
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I feel I have learned a lot

2121
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Your research is a thing with patterns

2122
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Arab world

2123
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I don't know

2124
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,800
The conclusion of the year is for other duties

2125
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,120
For example, a big tree is flat like a red block

2126
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:07,000
Or Xiaocaoruqiu sea sugar can be tried together

2127
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,600
In fact, we young people

2128
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,920
No pattern after error

2129
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,960
But many people even create waterways

2130
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,320
Luck also loads something like

2131
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:17,880
that is

2132
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,600
you know this time we are in apoya province

2133
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:20,320
haven't found out yet

2134
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,320
in which issue

2135
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:23,400
There must be a large portion

2136
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,560
So it's okay to say we are using

2137
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,600
he made the basis

2138
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,560
up to now

2139
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,840
many places

2140
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,000
Probably the same basic process

2141
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,360
So this job is the same

2142
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,520
Memory is the same process

2143
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,600
Yes, about the same

2144
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,000
also a lot of process

2145
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,360
not specifically

2146
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:42,160
Only Master Apo uses this method

2147
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:42,960
should be

2148
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,600
the so-called mass

2149
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,560
More or less the basic way to try

2150
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,400
Thanks

2151
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,960
no one is doing that

2152
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,120
Traces of research and development

2153
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,320
I just said this

2154
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,560
different countries

2155
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,080
Different things from Xiaoying Dalai

2156
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,600
that's interesting

2157
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So it is possible that when turned into a crop

2158
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Then put this instead

2159
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
No need to bring consumption to simultaneous

2160
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Please send this password to the same time

2161
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
In order to make the crop yield reach or how

2162
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
so all crops

2163
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
In the same way, send that classic to the same time

2164
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:28,000
That's what I heard

2165
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
sorry

2166
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Because we are interested in Youqing Rongye

2167
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
like to have some

2168
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Just interested in Youqing Rongye

2169
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
There is a natural imitation in Youqing Rongye

2170
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
it is almost

2171
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
don't send at the same time

2172
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
In order to make the crop yield reach or how

2173
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
so all crops

2174
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
In the same way, send that classic to the same time

2175
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
it's almost not the same

2176
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
otherwise no need

2177
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Obesity

2178
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Obesity

2179
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
i think two problems

2180
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
That is, can it be in this tree?

2181
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
can also grow to more

2182
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
very natural

2183
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Spend the day on that tree

2184
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
to find more high-definition zygote proteins

2185
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,500
Then the second is body fat

2186
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,000
if it doesn't need medicine

2187
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Even if it is HD fit

2188
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,000
How did its eggs come from?

2189
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
This is after our trip here

2190
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
So so the alcohol concentration method it's called is against the North

2191
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
To the north is that some mainland Chinese Xi Jinping is merciful.

2192
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:33,000
That's when organic plants continental their generation remains

2193
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
maybe income

2194
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
So those comparisons are still

2195
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Then it seems to be slowly

2196
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
There are also poisonous makeup bacteria, which are slower to exchange

2197
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Then your chronic process of dealing with North

2198
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
it will be compare

2199
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Won't cause problems with the tablet

2200
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
because it flows out slowly like this

2201
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
So this place will be more than a lot of disappointment

2202
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
There is a concentrated method

2203
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
it's totally right and no need

2204
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It doesn't need to be on the legs either, it just doesn't work at all

2205
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So I thought to myself, because it's totally useless

2206
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
But in the natural concentration, I don't know what's in it

2207
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
increased oxygen together

2208
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Organic Concentrate is made with Organic Pair of Legs is a lot

2209
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But there is a special

2210
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Nothing compares, nor oxygen plus

2211
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
not necessarily, but

2212
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Gaga has this, yes, yes, Gaga has this

2213
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
After all, but I mean, their claim is

2214
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
pan natural because it's always close to eating

2215
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
You also have a way to make it feed me

2216
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
that , their ubiquinone

2217
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
it pan it pan basically

2218
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The most pan, if you don't make you full, it will explode

2219
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
go all the way, there is a way

2220
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That is to say, as a filter manure

2221
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
If we can’t talk about the fertilizer filter, what about the fertilizer filter?

2222
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
It's relatively light bucket shell, yes

2223
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
The chlorine rate of the bucket shell is added to the

2224
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
This is, really can

2225
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
My burqa's writing, burqa's writing, sorry for my typing

2226
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,200
In addition to using green manure, it will use the way of turning

2227
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:15,200
do it with repost, blame it inside the photo of the business itself

2228
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:20,700
will use the switch to do different things, and then it will, that is,

2229
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:26,200
It is what you have harvested by yourself, and only harvested

2230
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,200
just break it down inside

2231
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:32,200
Unless that is to say, you eat part of it, and the rest will be discussed

2232
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,200
then how did you experience this

2233
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:39,200
You will also give me my cloth paper, but I still need to give it to you

2234
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,200
OK, I want to come, J.M.

2235
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,200
teacher, i want to ask

2236
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,200
Because if you hear people say that plants are absorbing egg coal

2237
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,200
Afterwards it will utilize because it is a sugar principle

2238
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:56,200
So it plays because it's the cleaning type of the printer

2239
01:33:56,200 --> 01:34:00,200
So it will be played, so it will cause a sudden frost

2240
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Wouldn't that job bring him back to something practical?

2241
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
In fact, no one was in private just now

2242
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Will An Nian and Mr. Xiao be the opposite?

2243
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Mr. Xiao will turn Liu Brown's words into love stories

2244
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
An Nian will make him make noise

2245
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:23,000
So in fact, An and Mr. Xiao are the best situation when they are in balance.

2246
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
So will he put his mind back again?

2247
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
he won't go let him not walk back

2248
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
In fact, the job has been scalding the cleaning place

2249
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
A job is something that is always getting to know a good person

2250
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
But the job has been doing this

2251
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
You try to get the screen's shirk is very low

2252
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
In fact, the job has been doing such a thing

2253
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
that is coming to his own friend

2254
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
then discuss with him

2255
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
What if his Energy and his lover

2256
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Then Zhou Xiang prays for blessings, will he have to put it back all the time?

2257
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
But because everything just said has to be absorbed

2258
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:10,000
All the absorption of the two copies is based on the difference in the rank of the pro's name to absorb the two copies.

2259
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
so he doesn't have a pro name on the outside

2260
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
He wants to suck both of them and can't get in

2261
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
The case of octagon on PHC

2262
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
that has lucky growth

2263
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
it looks like it's over

2264
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,000
it's like acting

2265
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
He just performs what he is usually pointed out to be better

2266
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
In fact, it has become a benefit

2267
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
In fact, you just don't let him become a benefit

2268
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Thank you, teacher

2269
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Thank you, teacher

2270
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
here

2271
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Learned

2272
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Ask for today's speech in China

2273
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
the teacher learned a lot

2274
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
so i have two questions

2275
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
The first question was just about a

2276
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
a director with a fake

2277
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Musbu and firmware are not good

2278
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
We know musbu he includes the director and the fake director

2279
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
His mind is a housekeeper

2280
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Hold the air under the country's top work

2281
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Let Ren Ti continue to screen out the three-phase package

2282
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
he got two copies

2283
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,840
Talk about a very important future that may change the content of Taiwan's textbooks

2284
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,220
I want to say earn this deeply

2285
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:10,900
He has mentioned that the local firefighters were redistributed to

2286
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:12,040
stuffed learning

2287
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,440
Then this is in the textbook

2288
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,400
This paragraph is not mentioned in the high school textbook

2289
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,000
is that possible

2290
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,600
In the next few years, with the influence of Dr. Cai

2291
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,480
This report of the study says eight seconds in the international

2292
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,640
Take this section of Taiwan's high school biology

2293
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:26,640
make a stuffed

2294
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:27,880
this is my first question

2295
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,920
second question

2296
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,160
pH

2297
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,840
Will the acidity and alkalinity of Tulao and its temperature affect

2298
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,640
ideas it absorbs

2299
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,920
affect this

2300
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:39,680
Quiet Firefighter's change in this amount

2301
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,320
right

2302
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,080
will affect

2303
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,320
So you have to test the pH of Tu Lao first.

2304
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,320
then do its research

2305
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,040
Thanks

2306
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,720
I'm wasting questions

2307
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,200
Is there a textbook that can transform Taiwan

2308
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,520
I took a textbook and wrote a textbook

2309
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,480
I wrote it in about three or four years

2310
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,080
Thanks

2311
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,240
but my own body

2312
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,000
count well

2313
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
the size of a person

2314
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,800
we had something here before

2315
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,600
until the next is forward out

2316
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,000
That's not likely to change in the next few years

2317
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Because Dr. Cai has done a lot of research internationally

2318
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,800
should be funded by teaching in Taiwan

2319
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,600
should accept it

2320
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,800
put forward wrong ideas

2321
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:17,800
Japanese teach biology in high school

2322
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,000
So your teaching takes into consideration 30 years from now

2323
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,800
I don't know who wrote the Taiwan professor's book

2324
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:25,800
Yes, so this very scary passage just now

2325
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,800
Dr. Xin Cai

2326
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,400
Thanks

2327
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,400
i might want to chase at home

2328
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,400
But it's true

2329
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,400
This is a study in Taiwan

2330
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:40,400
then scientifically recognized

2331
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,400
What would have to be rewritten would be a

2332
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,400
things without origin

2333
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,400
But this is the pride of Taiwan

2334
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,400
Taiwan's development

2335
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,400
Okay, wait a minute for everyone to see clearly

2336
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:52,400
my second episode

2337
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:54,400
if not

2338
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,400
are we here to applaud

2339
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,400
Thanks

2340
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Thank you.

2341
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:01,000
