1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,200
serve

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,120
Academia Sinica's dramatic speech

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Colleagues in this hospital, guests outside the hospital, hello everyone

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This new year begins this year

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We are very happy to invite Professor Zhong Yuan from the Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Come give this month's intellectual feast

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A certain professor has known him for 46 years

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In 1966, many people were still unborn

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In 1966, we were freshmen in the Chemistry Department of National Taiwan University.

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
train together for success

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
At the same time we are classmates

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We all went to America in 1971

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Get Washington University

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Ph.D. in St. Louis

15
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Then after postdoctoral

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
play me two years back to Taiwan

17
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Started his teaching position in Taiwan in 1978

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
By now everyone knows

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,400
He's been switching fields along the way

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,200
been converting

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,100
I didn't do experiments by hand before.

22
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,900
He started with theoretical statistics

23
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,900
Then do the energy conversion later

24
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,100
these experiments start experimenting with

25
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,500
Then his field is very wide

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,100
we have all in this scene

27
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,300
Structure of Liquid Water from Statistics

28
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,300
mesoporous molecular plug

29
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,300
and its application

30
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,300
There is also Feijun Xiangchumei

31
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,400
nanomaterials

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,900
for biomedical applications

33
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,900
and biological conditions

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,840
So his field started from the physical chemistry group of the early chemistry department

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,840
From the present inorganic group to the present chemical biochemical group

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
he stayed

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,340
Ask him to teach some organic words

38
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,140
He becomes the domain of all chemistry departments

39
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,340
I don't think it's a waste of his time

40
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,340
Then everyone applauds and welcomes this report.

41
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Thank you Xumin for the introduction

42
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,340
good night listeners

43
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,340
I wish you all a happy new year here

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,340
still during the new year

45
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,340
I think a lot of people haven't really gotten into the working situation yet

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, when I entertained the Chinese New Year earlier, I was at home a few days ago.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
then come out to play

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come out and play later, right?

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then we are very happy to see so many friends here tonight

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
this feast

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
good food

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
this

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is actually a small piece of research I did

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but as a public speaker he is more popular

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, I'm here too and I'm not going to give my personal speech.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Just to talk about some thoughts on this subject

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then these thoughts may be helpful to some young friends

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
maybe it's okay

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
at least see if there is any entertainment value

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
nano-bionic materials

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,240
Letâ€™s talk about bionics first, bionics means to imitate some mechanisms of living things

62
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
and its related this material

63
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,640
Unavoidable means that I imitate from a very small degree

64
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,800
Materials for human development are a long way off

65
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,920
From this period, the Iron Age, to the present IC, what are these?

66
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,160
This development of a material

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,400
The recent materials all emphasize being smart and smart

68
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Biology gives us a good reference point

69
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,440
In fact, the scientist or engineer first started teaching this method

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,360
This man is famous

71
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,560
I think it's doing this

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the ancestors of this matter

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
ah

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
this

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
what is this

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
he said this

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
it should be possible

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
this

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you are point

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
you want to move forward

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is point

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm going down now

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the second one

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
he didn't pay

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
first pay one

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
ok

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
ah

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Da Vinci

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If in the future this line

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to have a greatest award

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Shouldn't be a Nobel Prize

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Should be the Grand Vinci Award

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
first want

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
mimic creature

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
make a

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Deed built

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We can say that the earliest bionic

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
biomimetic design is

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
this great this big Vinci

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
this is his manuscript

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
he

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
in the box

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
this is an aircraft

104
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,840
flying is a human

105
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,440
this dream

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,140
I want to be human for the people

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,140
people just want to fly

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That

109
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,640
In China, old Taoists used to tie this rocket to a chair and sit on it

110
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,140
fly up

111
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,840
then fell to death

112
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,840
Now you also watch some extreme sports

113
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,040
All want to satisfy this desire

114
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Da Vinci

115
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
he

116
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
At once

117
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
design a flying machine

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,240
You can easily tell at a glance that he is imitating a bird

119
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,240
the flight of the bird

120
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Of course at that time it was a matter of motivation

121
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,940
no source of power

122
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,140
He can't make a plane

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,140
Immediately following the human desire to fly is not

124
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,140
First use this aircraft

125
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,840
da vinci's flying machine satisfies

126
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,040
but this

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
balloon

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is the first time a human has gone to space

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
In this Paris in 1783

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Avenue of Xiangxiao

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
very large audience

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The so-called big science at that time

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
is this science

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and ticket

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No need to apply to Congress for this research grant

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I charge tickets

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
received tickets

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can earn money to support your own research

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
At that time, one of the famous participants was Charlie

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
charlie is a physicist

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
one thing he's famous for is

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Study the temperature at which this volume is proportional to

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
absolute temperature

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But I'll mention it later

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He actually wasn't Charlie the first to go up into space.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the first to lead to charlie with a relative's ascension

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
this is the same year

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
1783 than he played

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This hot air balloon went up and played for months

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
At that time it was a ban

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
patients, so there are many ordinary people who are willing to pay to support scientific research

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
it's okay

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
clear balloon

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
this is carmontisi

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
According to Camontisi this electrolyzed water yields clear research

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So that's all the best research of our time.

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a pity that the biological science research list was not so popular at that time

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
At that time it was physical chemistry

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Relatively speaking, hot air balloons are more lively

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because you're filling a hot air balloon for an afternoon

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wait about half an afternoon.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Everyone can see it and go up

163
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The clear ball needs to be electrolyzed for a month

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
After one month of electrolysis, the balloon is still clear enough

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But what follows is still not a bionic story

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
still a balloon

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
By the 19th century balloon travel actually became a romantic affair

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A lot of people are fine, spend money on a balloon

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No, buy this ticket and get on the balloon

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go to this other trip to play

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
In the 24th period, even develop this

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This big letter balloon that slaughtered 1,000 people

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's this balloon that travels across the Atlantic Ocean

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
this is the restaurant inside

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Can do more than 1000 people, very big

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Of course it was a big disaster in the end

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
When this new insurance number lands

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
stormy then out to this telecommunications and then

179
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
sunny day

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If I think about it now, if I was appalled at the time

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This balloon flight may have broken down less suddenly.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It means to say one thing

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Something that doesn't necessarily regenerate is useful

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
At least in Da Vinci's time at that time, the beauty was different

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
It's beautiful, from an engineering point of view.

186
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,000
is a beautiful design

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
but it doesn't use

188
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,200
what you want to achieve you have other ways

189
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,800
so i'll start with this

190
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,100
that means not to say

191
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,800
Anyway, it can solve your current slight problem

192
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,600
But the problem with this flight

193
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,500
Of course, it's back to peeing in the end.

194
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,700
Airliner Boeing Design We Are Doing Now

195
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,000
this

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,300
basically from a bird's house

197
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,000
It was Da Vinci's idea

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,800
coming

199
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,000
But the nearest plane

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,100
you noticed

201
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,200
There are many further floors

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,900
you didn't notice the current plane

203
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,900
The wings and tails of many airplanes are raised

204
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,300
It is imitated the wings of this eagle

205
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,600
There is this cock to make the air flow

206
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,700
Generates more stable airflow

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
fly more stable

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I remember airplanes from decades ago not being like this

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Now there is an artificial intelligence

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But this is imitation big

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
not what i'm talking about today

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But let's start with this to illustrate a

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Even imitating the effects that living things can achieve

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
One of the most important dreams of mankind

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
on the aircraft to complete

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Next, let's take a look at what the biology itself has

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
are we worth noticing

218
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and then go a step further to imitate

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
These are some of the nanostructures in nature that I'll show you first

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And now scientists will want to mimic its

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The first one is this butterfly wing

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the butterfly wings

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
it has colorful things

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
this is a variety of colors

225
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,600
But it is not made of pigment

226
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,000
Usually we make the color of a thing

227
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
I draw a watercolor

228
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,400
This variety of colors is due to different pigments

229
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,500
direct this

230
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
The absorption light pattern is different due to the

231
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,400
It's not that it has a so-called optical crystal structure

232
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,000
periodic structure

233
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,800
after the light shines on

234
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
produced this

235
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,500
an interference phenomenon

236
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,500
produced

237
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,800
It's like a gas leak on the road

238
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
a thin layer of gasoline you will see the color

239
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,400
Then the structure of

240
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,400
of

241
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,000
periodic size

242
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
When changing it has

243
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,000
different colors

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
In this case

245
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,600
For a deep point its design is simple

246
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,200
It only needs to adjust the color slightly

247
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
It's the same Motive

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,500
continue with the same design

249
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
no need to go

250
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
produce many different

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,600
pigment

252
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,200
chemical production

253
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,000
It's good energy we all know

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,840
The energy of chemical functions is the same in living organisms

255
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,940
You have to do all kinds of different compounds

256
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,340
that is energy consuming

257
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,140
it doesn't need to be

258
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,440
Also of course the famous history

259
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,640
Many people have heard of this

260
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,140
this lotus

261
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,540
The water drop on the lotus

262
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,840
is easy to roll

263
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,540
it can use this to collect water

264
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,280
Then pour this droplet into a lotus midsole

265
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,780
Although it's not raining

266
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,940
But it is carefully

267
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,780
To have collected water droplets method

268
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,540
method can collect this liquid

269
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,580
There are many structures on this

270
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,780
Almost Zhou Qixing

271
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,180
but don't need this

272
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:52,840
But many fine bumps

273
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,440
The so-called lotus effect

274
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
Of course we'll make sense of it

275
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
If you go a step further, now this is a goose

276
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,300
For geese, its central structure can be designed

277
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:15,400
very detailed

278
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,300
So that the goose can have different colors when its wings are closed and when they are opened

279
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,100
And because the wings can be adjusted as they move

280
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,600
Let's talk about it

281
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,900
grains, just light

282
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,000
Organisms use this inescapable structure to control light

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
the control particle

284
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,700
this spider silk

285
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,100
Spider silk is very strong and tough

286
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,700
very strong

287
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,100
You've all heard this

288
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,400
In terms of units

289
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,700
Its strength is stronger than steel

290
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,900
In addition, special mention

291
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,000
It absorbs vibration energy very well

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,400
It's the wind that blows

293
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,800
It doesn't say it's vibrating very hard

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,600
just break

295
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,400
It absorbs vibrational energy

296
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,200
It is of course a single row structure

297
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,400
The structure of single-row mass can be very strong

298
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,800
and elastic

299
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,300
is our man-made fiber

300
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,800
Said that it is not yet so good

301
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,000
we have strong

302
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
Like the mud dragon is very strong

303
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
But the flexibility is not as good as

304
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
absorb this vibrational energy

305
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,800
not as good as

306
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Another letter

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,800
This is a marine oil creature

308
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,700
I am not a student of biology

309
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,400
I don't know much either

310
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,700
what is its chinese name

311
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:57,700
It has a row of tiny magnets inside its creature

312
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,700
This is raising Huashan iron

313
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,700
it can

314
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
and line it up

315
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,300
This is for relative geology

316
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,600
sense of direction

317
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,300
it sense of direction

318
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,900
The place it needs to live is in the water

319
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,300
This place where the concentration of breeding is relatively high

320
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,100
The geological nature of that layer

321
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,500
very different

322
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
It can use this as a sensor

323
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,600
If you add an additional layer

324
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,900
If you hold a magnet against it

325
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,200
it will line up against this magnet

326
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,800
This it can control the magnetism

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
we are in the lab

328
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
little baffling little events like this

329
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
easy to make

330
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Recent experiments in our laboratory

331
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,700
development can not do

332
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,400
but

333
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,100
we can't make it yet

334
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,200
just let it line up

335
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,400
and it's just that long

336
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,000
not too long

337
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,800
just line up so long

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,200
we can't do it yet

339
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
So you can do a lot in this

340
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,800
we can't do it yet

341
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
And to achieve its special function

342
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,000
other words

343
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
some of them

344
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,960
We don't really know about this feature

345
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,060
but it is very beautiful

346
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
It's that simple

347
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,100
it can be done very beautifully

348
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:11,560
This is the microalgae called plankton in the bottom of the sea

349
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,260
There are tens of thousands of species of algae

350
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,120
all the water in the world

351
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,420
Both freshwater and seawater have

352
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,220
it is a single celled organism

353
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,500
Its main structure is the dioxide system

354
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Another series of things it is calcium carbonate

355
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,220
all beautiful

356
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,840
When the structure of this it is like that

357
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,940
The one in the Forbidden City

358
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,720
What is that called Jiulongshu?

359
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,820
many layers

360
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,480
all have holes

361
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
that's a typical

362
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,980
In this case, its full gene has been solved

363
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,440
know the structure of this gene

364
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,980
it looks like two pieces of that

365
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,480
The pins are hooked together

366
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,640
There is a belt in the middle

367
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Different slender it's all beautiful

368
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,800
but looks different

369
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,800
You can classify it by its appearance

370
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Inside is a single cell

371
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
so

372
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,300
of course we know

373
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,000
Its main function is to protect

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,300
that is

375
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,200
It's hard, isn't it?

376
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,100
Then the hole can pass oxygen

377
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,400
But we really don't know why it grows so beautiful

378
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,800
this is also

379
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
this

380
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
confused one

381
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
In addition

382
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,500
in the lab

383
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,000
draw a family today

384
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
Dioxide systems can be easily made

385
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,500
Porous carbon dioxide system can be made

386
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,300
but absolutely can't do it

387
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,700
we are far away from this

388
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,100
We can't make such a beautiful thing

389
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,300
don't know how it's made

390
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,500
do not know either

391
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,000
don't know

392
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,500
know a little bit

393
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,600
this is a creature

394
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,800
some of some material

395
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,160
brief introduction

396
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,960
when you start

397
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,360
Know that he can do many things

398
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,860
to meet the needs of his life

399
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,960
In addition

400
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
We are all familiar with Google

401
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,660
this

402
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,660
There are many properties in biological materials that are

403
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,200
it

404
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,860
yes

405
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,160
not heart

406
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,260
it is hollow

407
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,460
Then what

408
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,260
It has a so-called layered structure

409
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,860
this is not shown

410
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,660
here

411
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,160
it doesn't matter

412
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,660
this

413
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,760
Google puts Aratu in your stomach, you can see it

414
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,960
it's light

415
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,400
especially bird

416
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,160
very light bone

417
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,360
but

418
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,560
It can support a strong force

419
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,560
this weight

420
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,200
it's the most important thing

421
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,460
there will be

422
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,360
so-called layered results

423
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,200
Let me explain this first

424
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,860
must use this opportunity to say

425
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,560
Explain what is a layered result

426
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,320
behind us

427
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,260
meeting

428
00:20:59,460 --> 00:20:59,960
talked about

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,160
It's a bone about a centimeter in size

430
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,600
and you start zooming out

431
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,600
The seventh stage of the shrinking company has a unique structure in each size

432
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's start with the smallest skeleton, which is divided into two parts

433
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
Inorganic and Organic

434
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,000
The non-deposit is basically this spiritual acid calcium

435
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
Calcium Spiritate with Oxygen Clearing

436
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,600
It's the little thing in the middle of the drawing here

437
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,800
And then another strong protein like muscle protein

438
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,000
called Collagen

439
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,000
it is arranged like this

440
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,600
This is the word in the smallest size

441
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,600
There are probably tens of nanometers to several nanometers here

442
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,500
Then

443
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,600
Color Gyn stacks up here

444
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,800
Then discharge a structure in a very orderly manner

445
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,300
This is the protein structure

446
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,000
is one of the so-called triple helixes

447
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Because of this triple helix it's a very strong protein

448
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Then what

449
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,500
further words

450
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,000
it forms this fiber

451
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,800
This fiber has a gradation from small size to large size

452
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,000
to the fiber

453
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,500
That is where you put this small piece or this piece

454
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,100
Immediately, where to put this small piece or this piece

455
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,400
Take this small piece where to put it or this piece

456
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,300
You keep looking this way until you get to the big size

457
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,800
Go all the way here to the small size

458
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,000
its different sizes

459
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,200
To adjust and make such a complex structure

460
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,300
We usually build, look at a building

461
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:58,000
Building a building like 101 is complicated enough

462
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,700
but

463
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
basically

464
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,320
If from the room to the floor to the whole building

465
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,000
just such a change

466
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,320
and quite monotonous

467
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,600
This is a very complex structure

468
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:16,000
Of course we can't do it in the lab.

469
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
we don't know much

470
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The whole body of this bone

471
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What is going on in the physical and chemical process

472
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Then letâ€™s talk about why Nano

473
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Why Nano

474
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
From the few examples just mentioned

475
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
you can tell

476
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Nano is its bottom foundation

477
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The bottom foundation builds up

478
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
build this

479
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This hierarchical structure

480
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
the bottom of this foundation

481
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
when going to ride out

482
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The thing at the bottom can be changed again

483
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It can be operated differently

484
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
but not the same as above

485
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It keeps this pretty consistent

486
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Many of our things are buildings

487
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
If we build it like this

488
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I started pumping some bricks

489
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You can smoke a few bricks

490
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You can't do it if you smoke too much

491
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
those bricks are going to fall

492
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
but

493
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Its bricks can still change

494
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What about the second one?

495
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
it is autonomous brick

496
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
not like we build a house

497
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
we have workers

498
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
there are architects

499
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Architects are drawing blueprints to design good

500
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
In the future, workers will build according to this blueprint

501
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
so there is outside

502
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
these people come in and do this

503
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
no problem

504
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
it is to self-assemble

505
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So it needs to start with nano cities

506
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
go up and assemble

507
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
there's no way you can get chunks of stuff

508
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Will fly around and self-assemble

509
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Only small enough things of course

510
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it has brownian motion

511
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
These Brownian motions go

512
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
movement to assemble

513
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
organic matter, inorganic matter

514
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Single pendulum planting, carbonic acid cover what

515
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it can do

516
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
to assemble

517
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
In addition

518
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
a physics student

519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,960
What everyone likes to talk about is the nature of the so-called world view

520
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
at a mesoscale

521
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,460
When going from nanometers to the scales in between

522
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
it's different

523
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,960
Nami's heart

524
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
it's not golden

525
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,960
it can be purple can be blue

526
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,460
when it was at that nanoscale

527
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
look different

528
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,960
when the organism goes

529
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
When using this nanoscale to do things

530
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
It equals some more degrees of freedom

531
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
It's not just 100 elements

532
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
it is equal to many other

533
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Like the color of the butterfly wings I just mentioned

534
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
it is made of the same material

535
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Then in the mesoscale the arrangement is not the same

536
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
its color can vary

537
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:46,960
So these are the things it needs to understand at the nanoscale

538
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
to understand the reasons for its results

539
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Then I can't go deep

540
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
because that's what it is

541
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
Talking about what needs to be studied in depth

542
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,960
I can't be in this person today

543
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
just tell you

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,840
That is to say, what does this concatenated structure do?

545
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,080
In fact, in the butt that kind of thing

546
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,000
I can't make it

547
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,400
because no one knows

548
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,000
But there are some things we can imitate to do these

549
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
we can't talk today

550
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
The next thing I'm going to talk about is saying

551
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
we bionic words

552
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
what to do

553
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Of course I can use examples one by one

554
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
explain

555
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Anyway, I can make a strong pull by doing this.

556
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
this elastic material

557
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
There are optical properties when we do it

558
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
but i'm not going to talk

559
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
i'm going to ask a question

560
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
These questions are like Da Vinci's original

561
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
raised a human dream

562
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
a big problem

563
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
In fact, after this big problem

564
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
let's see what's there

565
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We can do it with bionic technology

566
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is perhaps an important contemporary question

567
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It's a matter of energy

568
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
right now we

569
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
energy problem

570
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm looking for new energy

571
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And find the right energy and it needs to be green energy

572
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What most of us know about green energy is

573
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't want to burn that oil coal

574
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
no nuclear energy

575
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Then the rest is solar

576
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
or use this

577
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Solar energy produces that hydrogen in hydrogen generation

578
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Combustion batteries and so on, these so-called green

579
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But I feel that everything is not green enough now

580
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
The original meaning was that you just agreed to say that I will not use these petrochemical energies.

581
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But your design doesn't have any biological principles in it

582
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
so start talking about us

583
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Now let's think about this

584
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Just like when Darwin thought about how to fly

585
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
This is a big issue we face

586
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It may take decades for us to do this subject well.

587
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What I mean is to say it well, I really did it, and in the end it was really green

588
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
is the highest efficiency

589
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,500
To achieve the economic efficiency that biology can achieve

590
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Let's look at solar cells first

591
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,500
Solar cells I'm talking about solar chemical cells

592
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,000
not that one

593
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Originally made with this Xijing

594
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that

595
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
of course now

596
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We usually buy it in foreign countries

597
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,500
buy a solar panel

598
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
or something

599
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Just use Siri

600
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500
what we are saying now is

601
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,000
like attorney ye

602
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,500
but it can be converted into chemical energy

603
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,500
or converted into electrical energy

604
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
then you have sunshine

605
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
sunlight coming in

606
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
later you have

607
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
booster here

608
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,000
Then you have the anode

609
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
then you have this

610
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
cathode

611
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,500
anode for reaction

612
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
splits water into oxygen

613
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
The reaction at the cathode produces hydrogen

614
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Then simultaneously generate current

615
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
Of course you can adjust

616
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,500
Can make this a little less current a little more

617
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
No need to click a button, it will directly produce new oxygen

618
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
use it

619
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,600
wait but this

620
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,400
One is from the sun

621
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,100
Now of course many people are doing this problem

622
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,900
Then maybe there are a lot of refugee designs in it

623
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,300
like this is a refugee design

624
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,800
this

625
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
But let's think about something like this

626
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,100
we need to control many things

627
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,900
we need to control the light

628
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,900
We want to control the current

629
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,600
we want to control the gas

630
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
it has gas coming out

631
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,200
or fuel electrons when I'm gas going in

632
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,400
gas run

633
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,800
gas in and out

634
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,100
These organisms are

635
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
all do this

636
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
you a fast running newspaper

637
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,100
It is a very large energy consumption

638
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,600
it sucks in that

639
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Oxygen instant air is a lot

640
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,800
how does it manage

641
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,900
why is that management

642
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
This gas when it is divided into every body in its entirety

643
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
every cell

644
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,400
integrate it into the cell

645
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
fastest way

646
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,000
Can be labeled as a great power

647
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,800
How to do

648
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,000
In addition, the fuel cell

649
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
For example, what I just did

650
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,600
I made blue silver oxygen

651
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,500
blue silver oxygen delivery

652
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,800
Then go to other drug areas to use wide

653
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,400
Or do it by generating electricity

654
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,200
fuel cell

655
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,600
Here is a simple fuel cell schematic

656
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,500
It is to let green react with oxygen

657
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,800
in two motors

658
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,900
electrolyte in the middle

659
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,600
Electrolyte is going straight

660
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Then this is of course very environmentally friendly

661
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,400
because you are water

662
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,200
you have no pollution

663
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,000
You didn't produce filth

664
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
carbon dioxide

665
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Thanks

666
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,600
OK

667
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
This digging diagram is too simplified

668
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,300
You are your student

669
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,000
The first time you give it to me, you will say this

670
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But that's what I just said about a newspaper going fast

671
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It's definitely not that simple for the gas to come in

672
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Just to do an experiment in our high school

673
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
make a board

674
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Blow it onto that board

675
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
that doesn't have much power

676
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Because the surface area is too small

677
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
another this

678
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oxygen here is also oxygen

679
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And what about this pointing

680
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Traditionally, these are the problems you have to manage

681
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Your problem with the flow of this object

682
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
if we put it

683
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
If you take a closer look

684
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You need a lot of area here

685
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
What about this area?

686
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
makes it easy for hydrogen to walk

687
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
like the lungs of a newspaper

688
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you want to be able to walk to

689
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
All Blowing Agents Above

690
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
electrons are then produced

691
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
soon again on this conductor

692
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to run

693
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
run out tell me to get out

694
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
other side

695
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,860
So, therefore, it's the oxygen side that does the reaction

696
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,860
Also like this

697
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,740
Another important point is to have a blowing agent

698
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,660
Modern working blowers are generally made of platinum

699
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
Incredible Platinum Particles

700
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,960
So in response to a Platinum conduction

701
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,660
When the time is generated, run from this electrolysis value to the opposite side

702
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,460
other electronic words

703
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,300
Very close to a conductor

704
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
usually carbon

705
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,960
porous carbon

706
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,460
ok , you just imagine this one question

707
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,960
like a living organism

708
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,460
You have to manage the gas and your liquid

709
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,760
How about the fastest exchange to flow

710
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,360
blown

711
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,260
Here we immediately see one thing

712
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:49,760
We know that if we really want to make the electrons of the sun

713
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,760
Don't do that, it's platinum

714
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,360
platinum is expensive

715
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,060
And there are not many platinum reserves in the world

716
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,160
Where are you going to make this electronic

717
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Probably only for one country, the United States

718
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
no one else

719
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We obviously have to find other

720
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Then we have to ask whether there is anything in the organism

721
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
can do something like

722
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
so this imitation

723
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
From the comparative physics of this fluid

724
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
How to exchange gas and liquid

725
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
We have a structure to catalyze

726
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
that in chemistry

727
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
so-called biochemistry

728
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
how do you tie this thing together

729
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
become an integrated organism

730
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
then i pose this question

731
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
let's see what you're going to manage

732
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
What kind of experience do you have in managing this process

733
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
biomimetic approach to do

734
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
efficient and cheap

735
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Let's not wait for these with platinum

736
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I ask this question is now

737
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Cutting-edge research that everyone is doing

738
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,540
it's not me

739
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,540
Instead, let's bring this up in exchange for this idea

740
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,540
can there be some new ways

741
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,540
Of course, this is to manage sunlight, air and water.

742
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,040
Right, we just needed three things and that's it

743
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,740
I'm not advertising for the tourist bureau

744
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,340
But what I'm going to illustrate using this instruction

745
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,040
It is how you manage sunlight, air and water

746
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,540
ok let's look at the first thing

747
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,740
Sunshine is just this

748
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,240
Right, the first thing is the light

749
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,980
Now if you look at the current solar panels

750
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,040
will still shine

751
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,140
When it is replaced, there will be light reflection back, it is not used

752
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,980
It doesn't work. You better suck all the light in.

753
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,140
right

754
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,040
And bacteria are useful

755
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,580
this is the biggest

756
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:55,980
There is no principle of heat to tell you that some light must be reflected back

757
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,080
you just need

758
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
common now

759
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,840
It doesn't matter if it's made of bacteria or glass

760
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Some of the light is reflected

761
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,720
that's wasted

762
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,440
Organisms can be completely bacteria

763
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,800
It's the perfunctory of the black forehead

764
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,200
it is also a perfunctory

765
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,800
that is, each one is

766
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,560
Each of these is a cell

767
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
And then a further fine-grained structure looks like this

768
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,360
it's going to be all black

769
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,080
what is the reason

770
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,680
It only comes out in the middle of the night against time

771
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
night

772
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,440
words at night

773
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,880
shine a little light on you

774
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,680
Others saw it and ate it

775
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,080
So it is completely non-reflective

776
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,320
Let's look at this physics principle first

777
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,280
Principles of Physics

778
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,560
if i have two things

779
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
one glass one air

780
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,680
only one interface

781
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,760
two rings

782
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,360
Then everyone has learned the light will go on

783
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,240
then there will be a part

784
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
regardless of reflection

785
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,600
It depends on the difference between the two dielectric coefficients.

786
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,100
If it's glass and air, there's a big difference.

787
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,100
The difference is very big because the air is very cellular

788
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Boundary electrical coefficient is almost 1

789
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,600
About 2.5 for glass

790
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,600
That's not the dielectric coefficient this refractive index

791
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,800
But if you have a layer of coating in the middle

792
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,100
The dielectric coefficient of this coating is between these two

793
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,600
You will reflect less at this time

794
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,500
it certainly looks like two chances

795
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,500
But every time it comes out less

796
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,800
The best situation is infinite layers from here to here

797
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,900
something from the index of refraction of a glass

798
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,400
Until the air changes continuously

799
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
That black forehead is done and that's it

800
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
it does this structure

801
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,900
You look like a protocone from the side

802
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,600
Then periodically

803
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,500
Then you can see that there are fewer and fewer things that can be blamed.

804
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
that is from

805
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,700
Looking at it layer by layer

806
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,700
Refractive index decreases from now on

807
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,500
In the end, all the light goes down without reflection

808
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
In this case

809
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,500
I think

810
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,500
should be

811
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,900
is a do

812
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
A good material for solar panels

813
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
The light that goes in doesn't come out

814
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,700
this black thing

815
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,100
of course

816
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,100
people

817
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,700
Noticed this early on and now figured out how to do this

818
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,700
tie this

819
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,300
but not for solar cells

820
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,500
Solar cells are not so expensive now

821
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,100
say in stealth plane

822
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,400
stealth plane

823
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,800
That electromagnetic wave owned by that stealth plane

824
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
from that

825
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,900
microwaves to this visible light

826
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,300
The entire spectrum is completely non-reflective

827
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
that's black

828
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,700
then you can't see

829
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,100
In fact, this research

830
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,500
Central Plains Institute is doing well

831
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,400
these two

832
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
Because of Chen Guixian

833
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,660
Because it was originally locked because Lin Yuxiong was too big and there were too many forests

834
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,260
is next door to me he is actually next door

835
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,600
so i know what they do

836
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,000
They specialize in doing a lot of one-dimensional

837
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,960
I just said that he wants to follow the original type

838
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,160
Raw chai materials, you can see that they make all kinds of materials

839
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,960
This desalination plus fine arts, shower plus and so on these materials

840
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,600
how to do it i'm not talking too much

841
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,560
I'm just talking about the application of the so-called plasma

842
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,800
or plasma discharge

843
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,600
Then release all kinds of temperament

844
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,060
Temperament needed If you want to do desalination

845
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,560
You just put the thin bowl and this bowl down

846
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,960
then excited in the plasma

847
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,600
Break it down into molecules and start to grow

848
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,360
This is a device for microwave discharge of plasma

849
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,120
They made it in 2007

850
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,320
I haven't asked them lately

851
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,360
they should be

852
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
There is more progress and improvement

853
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,000
will be to the whole world

854
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,800
This is the original

855
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,080
this

856
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,120
This is their original one

857
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,280
Silicon Wife

858
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,400
Then after it grows this colorful coding

859
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,080
is black

860
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Then this reflective green word

861
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,200
about percent

862
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,360
one percent

863
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,960
maybe less than one percent

864
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,560
a few tenths of a percent

865
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,120
It's a very black thing

866
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,120
this is one

867
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,640
imitate this black forehead

868
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,040
such a thing

869
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,760
Their materials do well is to say

870
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,440
in each band

871
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,000
This reflex is close to the time collar

872
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,480
this is their material

873
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,160
made with fine

874
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,000
This is outside the visible photon line

875
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,600
follow up infrared band

876
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,880
This is the mid-infrared band

877
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,360
just wave longer

878
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,480
still very low

879
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,720
And then to the far infrared

880
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,760
got a little higher

881
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This bankruptcy has been very long

882
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,200
Until the microwave is relatively high

883
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,800
This material is such a

884
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,500
Of course, microwaves are also available.

885
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,000
It is also possible that its materials have to be further evolved

886
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
maybe they already have

887
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Didn't find them today

888
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,500
That's the job of Academia Sinica

889
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,000
I think I am obliged to introduce the work of Academia Sinica today

890
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
so

891
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,500
The second thing to talk about is

892
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Heat management How to manage heat

893
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,500
these guys

894
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,000
Managing heat is a master

895
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Polar bears can survive temperatures as low as minus 50 degrees

896
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,500
life without problems

897
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,500
no problem at all

898
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,000
but

899
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
yes it can

900
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
This is completely mentioned and does not spread out

901
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:09,000
you give you a hint of this

902
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
If you take an infrared

903
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And the band is almost 10 micrometers

904
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
that infrared

905
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
there is an infrared

906
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Use that band to take pictures of the one in Beijing

907
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They went to take pictures in the ice and snow

908
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
With visible light, you can still see Beijing

909
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
you use that infrared camera

910
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
you can't see

911
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
except where its nose is

912
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
you can see the nose

913
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
but the body can't see

914
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
is that it manages heat very well

915
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Its temperature is the same as the ice coat next to it

916
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
it even reflectivity

917
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Infrared reflectivity is the same

918
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
it can do this

919
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
blood on that band

920
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
reflect with this

921
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
its this fur

922
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
this is its fur

923
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
It also has thick subcutaneous death of course

924
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It died 10 cm under the skin

925
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
then he is so thick

926
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
subcutaneous wings

927
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
This is of course adiabatic

928
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
then on top is hair

929
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
He has fur with a unique design on it

930
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
this is his hair

931
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
electron microscope

932
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
he is empty

933
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
If we cut up human hair and look at it

934
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
go see that is real

935
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
but

936
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
polar bear hair

937
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Looks like there are a lot of holes in the middle

938
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The hair is transparent if you take it directly.

939
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
quite transparent hair

940
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
A lot of transparent things accumulate on the body

941
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
looks white

942
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
this is no problem

943
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Light range

944
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But it's this hollow design

945
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
makes his infrared

946
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
This is the electromagnetic wave I just talked about

947
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
top down

948
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's the same head now

949
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
fever

950
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The temperature inside is 37 degrees

951
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
he has infrared

952
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
He makes a perfect greenhouse effect

953
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Infrared rays are emitted from the body

954
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
completely blocked

955
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
completely blocked

956
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
The basic truth is this

957
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
it

958
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Except for the hairy hollow, is it air?

959
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
so hot

960
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Heat conduction has this heat conduction and this heat radiation

961
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
If it conducts heat, it relies on this hollow

962
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And relying on the casting of these pass buttons

963
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This is the heat conduction itself

964
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
In addition, thermal radiation

965
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Produced in

966
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Its body temperature produces heat radiation that is about the same

967
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
The broken long infrared rays of 10 micrometers

968
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's going to block that infrared ray

969
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
this is its body

970
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
its heat source

971
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The refractive index of infrared rays

972
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
gradually clear up

973
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
reduce

974
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
to the last words

975
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Infrared rays are always reflected back

976
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
every time there is

977
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Equal reflection effect

978
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I won't come out until the end

979
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Its body temperature can be maintained

980
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
you can keep

981
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
This is light management

982
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
good

983
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
Another kind of light management is sea urchin

984
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,200
sea â€‹â€‹urchin is such a guy

985
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,900
The meat is delicious when you open it inside.

986
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,100
this is expensive chicken

987
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,100
this

988
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,800
very expensive japanese food

989
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,200
this creature

990
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,000
it grows many times

991
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,000
it's very hard

992
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,600
It's hard to back off

993
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
carbon brick cover

994
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm probably talking about the structure inside the four

995
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,800
it contains living organisms

996
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,800
it's an animal on a gun

997
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,100
have mouth

998
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,000
this is its mouth

999
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,300
anal groove

1000
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
on the anal groove

1001
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,000
It's counterclockwise and counterclockwise

1002
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,200
mouth and teeth

1003
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,400
Then you see four is this

1004
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:54,800
ice cube long block four

1005
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,200
In addition it can be moved

1006
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,200
it has this string

1007
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
can move

1008
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm interested in this part

1009
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
if you touch it

1010
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,500
it will move immediately

1011
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,200
That time will move the direction

1012
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,000
will be towards you

1013
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,700
because you are the enemy

1014
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,500
it's facing you

1015
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,600
so you can't hold it

1016
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,800
can't move it

1017
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,500
It's an optical fiber except this

1018
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
it's a nice crystal

1019
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,000
Then the crystal pours light into it

1020
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,200
it is an optical fiber

1021
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,200
The sea urchin turns into a shadow by this

1022
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,500
There is an incentive to subsidize it

1023
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,700
For example, a crab comes to eat

1024
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,700
Crabs are powerful and will eat sea urchins

1025
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,700
turn it over

1026
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,700
i dig inside

1027
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,700
But when it comes, there will be shadows

1028
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,700
or the fish will have a shadow on it

1029
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,700
It adds this change of light

1030
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,200
I think the management of this light is very powerful

1031
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,700
The three-layer cover

1032
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,400
If you go outside Taroko to step on the marble

1033
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Taroko, you only need one piece of this thing when you pick it up

1034
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,000
Call Calsan such a hard and solid thing

1035
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,700
but sea urchin stone looks like this

1036
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,100
so

1037
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,700
this is a short stone

1038
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,400
Then the barrel junction looks like this

1039
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,500
This is a juvenile sea urchin

1040
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,400
this is an adult

1041
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,600
it is a hole with many holes

1042
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,600
But the whole piece is a single body

1043
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,000
What is a single meridian body? That is, if you use X-rays on it

1044
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,900
to rap

1045
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,600
you see six o'clock

1046
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,100
not a ring

1047
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,100
In other words, all scriptures and phases are consistent

1048
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,100
a single body

1049
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,000
But obviously there's a lot of organic matter in there.

1050
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,900
clamped with it

1051
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,700
It forms a very unique single

1052
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,200
such a monotony

1053
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,700
That's because there's a lot of organic matter in it

1054
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,800
makes it hard to break

1055
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,200
You've eaten Bunker and you know it

1056
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,700
Bunker is better than this booth

1057
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,000
It's hard for you to bomb it with inorganic matter

1058
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,900
It's hard, you can't hit it if you hit it vertically

1059
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,200
What is it, a lot of organic matter in the middle

1060
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,900
Electricity will dissipate its power

1061
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,640
An inorganic, naturally occurring mineral

1062
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,500
Hit it vertically and it will break

1063
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,000
So it has a certain Indian

1064
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,200
In addition it is a monolithic light

1065
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,400
Yes delivery is very efficient

1066
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,300
So it's an organic and inorganic load

1067
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,000
Inorganic part is carbon brick cover

1068
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,100
The organic part is complicated

1069
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,000
probably this glycoprotein

1070
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,700
single body

1071
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,300
And then, a light guide

1072
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,700
It is also a transmitter of feeling power

1073
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:40,000
Because it is hard, it is very sensitive to feel the force

1074
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,100
There's something out there that feels as soon as it touches it

1075
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,800
The laboratory wants to imitate

1076
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,900
Is it possible to make this hole worry

1077
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,200
This is something I made in my lab

1078
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,300
carbon brick cover

1079
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,600
is in the form of a special carbon brick cover called Voltaire

1080
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,800
it is hexagonal body

1081
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,200
Urea and glue

1082
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,500
In the small threshold, the collagen in Gelatin

1083
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,500
It reacts at a high temperature of more than 100 degrees

1084
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,500
The economy made looks like a single catty

1085
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,400
Then the X-ray evidence and Peng Huan's evidence know

1086
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,900
It's the projectile, there's nothing wrong with it

1087
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,200
But this economic

1088
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,500
open it up and take a closer look

1089
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,200
first time i see this next big jump

1090
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,000
because of many holes

1091
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,000
the kind you know

1092
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,300
The kind that helps a whole piece

1093
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,400
The body is different

1094
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,600
it's obviously a pound

1095
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,900
because it has spirit and horns

1096
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,600
Spirit and horns

1097
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,700
but there are many holes in it

1098
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,700
Those are the collagen I added

1099
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,800
After burning the collagen

1100
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,000
find many holes

1101
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,700
Then I call it porous single catty

1102
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,200
This is like the result of a sea urchin

1103
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,800
You must have some

1104
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Kidney knots are, gallbladder knots are

1105
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,700
there will be some points

1106
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
just didn't grow up

1107
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,100
When you grow up, you'll be in so much pain

1108
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I need to see a doctor

1109
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Those deadlines are guts too

1110
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But this apple meal lid

1111
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
They can make this kind of

1112
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
This kind of good optical properties

1113
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I'm not going to talk about his optical nutrition

1114
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Simply because he is guts

1115
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
A small relationship but a lot of holes in it

1116
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
if the hole goes in something else

1117
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
you can sense him

1118
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
do other things

1119
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
to say is to say

1120
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Organisms manage this light very efficiently

1121
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
This is proof that he has guts

1122
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
This uses the point of the electronic teacher

1123
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Next I will talk about gas management

1124
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
what we just said

1125
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If I want to make a fuel cell like that

1126
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Or when it is solar battery of the decomposition of water

1127
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I want to manage this gas

1128
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
ah what to do

1129
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Let's take a look at the structure of a bird's lungs

1130
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,500
it's a bird's lungs

1131
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,000
Birds have the most powerful lungs of all living things

1132
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
the most powerful

1133
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
When this eagle is fighting

1134
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
there is a lot of air

1135
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And they fly high

1136
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
the air is thinner

1137
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
And some birds can fly as high as the Simara Mountains

1138
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
The density of air is only one-third of that of the earth's surface.

1139
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So its lung blood has a powerful function

1140
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
The lungs are of course because of the exchange of air and blood

1141
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
it is a two-fluid

1142
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
In terms of painters, it is a two-way fluid

1143
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
it has air bags

1144
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Then there are many very thin

1145
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Hierarchical structure of this pipeline

1146
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
air blood

1147
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Then what they cross is theirs

1148
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,900
We do exchange the molecule O2

1149
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,600
If you zoom in to see the details

1150
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,500
you see it is

1151
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,400
It is the result of the concatenation formula I just mentioned.

1152
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,400
It has the largest sac is the air sac

1153
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,700
Then there are these spaces in the middle

1154
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,300
there is even less space

1155
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,800
space then the hole

1156
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,900
They conduct this flow of gas and liquid

1157
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,700
There are some things that I can't figure out now. I'm not studying

1158
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,800
Life I don't know which one is slippery and which one

1159
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,300
liquid

1160
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:36,800
so

1161
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,400
The resolution diagram is like this

1162
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,000
It is joined into the result of a large tube

1163
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,100
To a small tube, ah, a smaller tube

1164
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,400
Then do this air flow

1165
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,300
this is a blood vessel

1166
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,300
have

1167
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:56,800
very effective this exchange

1168
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,300
From a rougher university

1169
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
to this menace pavilion

1170
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
do this

1171
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
something like this

1172
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
In terms of materials

1173
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
people just want to do

1174
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,000
This is a porous material

1175
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,000
We've had trouble using this so far

1176
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,000
What makes protein such a material

1177
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Apparently creatures can do

1178
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
but we can always make inorganic

1179
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,500
Inorganic material

1180
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,000
Our laboratory makes materials with many holes

1181
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Its method is to take organic matter and inorganic matter

1182
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
to self-install

1183
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
This is completely self-installed

1184
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
one foot and it will form like this

1185
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
This part is organic matter

1186
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Then the next wall is

1187
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Dioxide is inorganic and hard

1188
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Finally you put the organic matter inside

1189
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Burn off the collar or extract

1190
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
you make the hole

1191
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
the size of the hole

1192
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
you can control

1193
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Using the molecular size of this organic

1194
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
you control

1195
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Available from two Nami

1196
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
to maybe dozens of nami

1197
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Such a medium porous material

1198
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,300
it's a water dragon coming out from corner to corner

1199
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,860
So it has all sorts of hierarchical results

1200
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,060
you can control

1201
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,100
I can't speak here today

1202
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,800
I just show you one

1203
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,000
What does the electron micrograph look like

1204
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
its hole

1205
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,500
This is from an interface to see it

1206
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,400
This is to start a

1207
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,600
It has a variety of one tube is bent

1208
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,700
this is a straight tube

1209
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:20,700
This is the oxygen system

1210
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,700
this is a hole

1211
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,500
OK, what about the porous material?

1212
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,700
Can progress to class

1213
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,300
This is the one that the lab wants to imitate

1214
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,800
Hierarchical result approach

1215
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,300
This paper is not my paper

1216
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,300
this is

1217
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,800
it does is a hierarchical

1218
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,100
A large amount of gas can be quickly dispersed inside

1219
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,100
into the tiny hole

1220
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,300
This gas is TNT

1221
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,800
prevent explosives

1222
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,200
when passing the airport now

1223
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,600
they are most afraid of you

1224
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,900
yes there is this

1225
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,900
this dynamite

1226
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,900
TNT is an organic molecule

1227
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,000
Three-way calculation plus this

1228
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
This molecule is difficult for you to use

1229
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,660
this

1230
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,800
abandoned to detect it

1231
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,100
The best way is to develop an artificial pen

1232
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,300
artificial brush

1233
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,860
That artificial pen is very sensitive

1234
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,520
That is to say, your gas can

1235
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,360
Scattered into a small hole, that small hole

1236
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,060
run a detection version

1237
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:26,360
Well, I'm not talking about the detection version here, I'm talking about it's a god-like structure

1238
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,720
From Big Hole, Medium Hole to Small Hole

1239
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,680
This small hole is the size of a TNT molecule

1240
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,840
It used it as a template when it was originally made

1241
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,840
This is the concept of template synthesis

1242
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,840
I use it as a template when compositing, this is the red one

1243
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,840
Other things that are silica

1244
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,840
this template

1245
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,340
So when TNT comes

1246
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,740
It just snaps in and can suck a lot

1247
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,440
No matter how big or small other molecules are,

1248
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,940
So it's very sensitive to selectivity

1249
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,280
Then because it is a god-like structure

1250
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,440
From the big hole to the small hole in a short time

1251
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,440
The past seems to be a life

1252
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
The purpose is the same as the lungs or many small holes in the nose

1253
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
it can be smelled at once

1254
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
This is gas management

1255
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
used in this

1256
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
What I just said about batteries on carbon

1257
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
One of the things I just talked about is

1258
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
The material is carbon

1259
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Then your porous carbon can also be made like this

1260
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Like the one just now, it's a carbon dioxide system

1261
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
this is carbon

1262
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
You can see that there are relatively large holes

1263
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Then the big hole will be in the wall

1264
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
there are many small holes

1265
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Also, have you seen the battery?

1266
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
inside the black and white part

1267
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
there are even smaller holes

1268
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
it is made of three

1269
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Let it load this Platinum Sharder on it

1270
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
its this gas management is good

1271
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
because big hole to small hole

1272
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
In addition

1273
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
All these carbons are linked together

1274
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
So its conductive path is connected

1275
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
no power outage

1276
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
It can be done like this to adjust the battery

1277
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,840
Then its current versus voltage is the best

1278
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:10,600
In comparison, activated carbon or platinum ridges can be used

1279
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,080
it performs much better

1280
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,540
This is a hierarchical bionic concept.

1281
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,840
Of course it can be used as a reactor

1282
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,160
Our laboratory is in this Dadongqiao Cave

1283
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,960
full of various catalysts

1284
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,800
then do the chemical reaction

1285
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
so soon

1286
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,800
react in a short time

1287
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,260
I won't talk about it

1288
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,500
Okay, let's talk about water

1289
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,160
how water is managed

1290
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,900
In a fuel cell just like that

1291
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,700
for example

1292
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,500
hydrogenation of oxygen to electricity

1293
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,000
Then it's water

1294
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,160
Oxygen and hydrogen are poured in all the time

1295
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,760
In fact, the water keeps coming out.

1296
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,260
How do you manage this water?

1297
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,560
is also an important thing

1298
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,220
if you don't manage

1299
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,620
it blocks everything

1300
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,560
It will be more stressful to come in again

1301
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,240
you spend more

1302
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,560
your efficiency will decrease

1303
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,800
or at the end

1304
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,960
can't stay at all

1305
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
stay in many places

1306
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,560
those with tiny holes

1307
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,760
To manage the flow of this water

1308
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,560
this is a problem

1309
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,600
Well, we've just talked about this compounding effect

1310
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,600
The compounding effect is one

1311
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,360
One way to manage water well

1312
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,360
right

1313
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,360
let's see

1314
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,960
how from there

1315
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,960
release to be bright

1316
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,360
Let's look at the lotus leaf again

1317
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:28,920
lotus leaf words

1318
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,920
it's a drop

1319
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,520
can be on this lotus leaf

1320
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,920
this slide

1321
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:36,960
The reason is the so-called contact angle

1322
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,920
Very big

1323
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,920
it's not collapsed

1324
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,120
but rolled up

1325
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,360
rolled up state

1326
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,920
why is it like this

1327
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,920
Because it is related to this structure

1328
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,320
its a lot raised fog

1329
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,320
let's see

1330
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,120
This so-called supertransportation

1331
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,280
A strong wall of clear water

1332
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,080
like glass

1333
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,280
Glass is a strong wall of clear water

1334
00:57:59,280 --> 00:57:59,920
just water will

1335
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Spread it flat and become a thin layer of water film

1336
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
If you pour water, say spicy

1337
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
if you put a spicy surface

1338
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
it will become a semicircle

1339
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
or something more than a semicircle

1340
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But there is still an angle

1341
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That angle won't be 180 degrees

1342
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
it will be there and stick there

1343
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
If a glass is heavily oiled

1344
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
just can't get oil

1345
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
see a lot of water sticking to it

1346
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
on the leaf of the plant

1347
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Of course it feels oily

1348
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
it's already a bit of a loser

1349
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But it's not enough to say let that

1350
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
that thing

1351
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That droplet is easily in the liberalization

1352
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
it further this structure

1353
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
There are all kinds of talk here

1354
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
This is the so-called Cassi state

1355
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That is to say, it is easier for us to understand

1356
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
That is to let this water

1357
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Go to bed of nails for that yogi guru in india

1358
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
isn't a yoga guru a lot of bed of nails

1359
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
that has a lot of nails on it

1360
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Then the master lay down

1361
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
You hang it vertically, what are you doing?

1362
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
right

1363
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Then we just let the water

1364
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Drops of water to make this bed

1365
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
when he was in bed

1366
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
he doesn't want to go down

1367
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Because the surface tension

1368
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
too much energy not to slip out

1369
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
he won't go down

1370
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
If he doesn't go down, he will roll up.

1371
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
This is what causes the so-called superspeed water benefit

1372
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
if the plant is on that lotus leaf

1373
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Basically this is enough

1374
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But if the lotus leaf goes further

1375
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
is the combination of these two Nami

1376
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
with micron

1377
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
This is its micron scale

1378
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
This is the scale of difficulty

1379
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
it combines two

1380
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
This water transfer is more efficient

1381
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I won't talk about the details there

1382
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
don't talk too much over there

1383
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
This is to introduce

1384
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
The other one is that you say it slides

1385
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
if there is something on it

1386
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
is a plain spicy surface

1387
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
it or glass surface

1388
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
It will stick and stay still

1389
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
it doesn't move at last

1390
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But if it's a speeding water like this

1391
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
it not only understands

1392
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And it will take the tension away

1393
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
So the filthy bastard dripped to the roll

1394
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,260
This oneness shows that it is clean

1395
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,060
very clean without dust

1396
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,260
So we say that you will not be stained by the fog

1397
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,960
So there's a lot of application here

1398
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,400
For example, the lenses of your glasses

1399
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,260
with superfast water on it

1400
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,900
so you don't get foggy

1401
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,560
your camera

1402
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,900
Best Camera Lenses Top Now

1403
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,200
treated with ultra-fast water

1404
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,760
It won't get foggy if it gets water droplets on it

1405
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,760
The next thing I want to introduce is the work of Academia Sinica

1406
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,360
It belongs to Dr. Chen Peilin from the Ink Center

1407
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,360
he's here ask him a question

1408
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,960
He just figured out how to do it in this one

1409
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,760
The solid surface makes that like a lycium

1410
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:44,960
raised structures on leaves

1411
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,160
The method is to use this sphere implicit in a script

1412
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,660
can be made into a very uniform ball

1413
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,960
then use this

1414
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,360
this

1415
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,160
It should be Shi Wen's.

1416
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,560
This plasma allows the plasma to eliminate sugar

1417
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,560
remove sugar

1418
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Little Five Seconds looks like this

1419
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
smaller than look

1420
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It disappears like this in fifty seconds

1421
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Then you look like a spit

1422
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
If you continue to eliminate, you will exhale more

1423
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
so

1424
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Then

1425
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
departmental complex

1426
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It has ribs that modify the surface

1427
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Then there is the flow

1428
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I won't go into that detail

1429
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
the point is

1430
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
After these plasma demagnetization

1431
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
cause a lot of aspirates

1432
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Finally, from the contact angle

1433
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's the original shape of 115 degrees.

1434
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
to the last one hundred and fifty one

1435
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Actually it can do 170 degrees maybe

1436
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
But it's hard to do 190 degrees

1437
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Rolled away because of a slight shock

1438
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Three rolls of that thing

1439
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That's the butt bed effect

1440
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
butt bed effect

1441
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
under different cutting conditions

1442
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
if its exhalation condition is different

1443
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
The contact angle ended up being close to 180 degrees

1444
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
this is a

1445
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
bound

1446
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,200
concept to do

1447
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,200
When he was almost unified

1448
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,400
Chen Peining this job

1449
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,200
In addition, the future of Chinese scientists

1450
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,400
He later made great achievements in this field

1451
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,560
They use various tests

1452
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,400
Chemistry collaborators make closer to that

1453
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,600
the lotus

1454
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,000
The structure of the synthetic surface

1455
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,000
he uses this

1456
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,900
He uses an electrical method

1457
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,000
So make a polymer square

1458
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,800
or make a ball to many divisions

1459
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,200
he can do well

1460
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,800
this

1461
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,400
this drop of water is on top

1462
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,600
arrangement of carbon tubes

1463
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,400
This is the one from Beijing Academy of Sciences

1464
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,200
main road book

1465
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,200
carbon nanotubes

1466
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,400
there is another one that does

1467
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,100
It's also the top bed

1468
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,100
This is more like the top bed of an Indian master

1469
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,800
let the bottom be on top

1470
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,800
Then work is what I can control

1471
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,200
i can control him

1472
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I see the surface

1473
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
turn into crisp water

1474
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:56,400
super crisp water

1475
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,800
Turn into ultra-clear water at once

1476
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,400
Just spread some ingredients on top

1477
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,000
this guy

1478
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,560
to this thing outside

1479
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,600
let it fall

1480
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,660
This section is backwater

1481
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,460
then the whole will be out of water

1482
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,500
In addition to the puzzling structure just mentioned

1483
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,300
for which the structure will exceed

1484
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,080
Then when it stops, it's clear water

1485
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,160
So this water will be collected and turned into a ball once it is dipped in water.

1486
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,500
Very precise control over water

1487
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,060
For example, this is the contact angle

1488
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,620
Contact angle

1489
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:32,000
Then this Cosmite can do the control of this track

1490
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,560
After this electrical control

1491
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,360
Or PH control can be done

1492
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,420
This is an example of an electrical control

1493
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,000
A liquid approaches 180 degrees from the contact angle

1494
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,800
Change the voltage with control

1495
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,580
fall

1496
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,860
spread out

1497
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,920
many degrees

1498
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,680
That

1499
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,220
of course japanese

1500
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:54,020
sell it quickly

1501
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,100
Japan combined light blowing agent

1502
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,900
What is produced is ultra-clear water and super-water

1503
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
On the surface this is super salary

1504
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,500
can make this surface very smooth

1505
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:10,000
So if it is reflected in the rearview mirror of the car, it will not fog up

1506
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
good

1507
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
just that particle

1508
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
haven't really used it yet

1509
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I originally spoke about this fuel cell

1510
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
its management

1511
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
But it shouldn't be possible to imagine

1512
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
what can be done

1513
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
the flowing water

1514
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Make super pay for the water when it pours

1515
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Then its gas flow and liquid flow will not block each other

1516
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Because it, the liquid is suspended on some hollows

1517
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,000
gas flow

1518
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
nose does not interfere heavily

1519
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
No blocking, no flotting

1520
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Batteries made in a pro-family reaction

1521
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
produce water, this water can

1522
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
very easy

1523
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
because it slides easily

1524
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
it can flow

1525
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
So in doing the management

1526
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
water management

1527
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Apparently that should also help

1528
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Finally I'll talk about catalysts

1529
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
you want to do this

1530
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,600
What is the most basic chemical reaction

1531
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,840
there is a chemical reaction

1532
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:06,880
new example

1533
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,620
becomes H2

1534
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,140
right? get electrons get electrons from electrodes

1535
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,480
becomes H2

1536
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,640
Or H2 conversely means that H2 becomes a new example

1537
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,940
Then the new example has to be traditionally ground to the other end

1538
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,700
Then H2 becomes a new example is the lost electron

1539
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,540
To do this thing, that depends on a shattered body

1540
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:27,860
I was talking about platinum

1541
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:30,360
I pay more attention to the oxygen head on the other end.

1542
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,080
Oxygen headers are also

1543
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,460
Oxygen O2

1544
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,420
The first thing it needs to accept electrons to become O2-

1545
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,260
that's the first step

1546
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,820
Then step by step it becomes

1547
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,720
Platinum is too expensive

1548
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,920
What we just said, if it is really made of platinum

1549
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,120
we can't go on

1550
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,720
This is what the sun can't do

1551
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,120
Because the reserves of platinum on the earth are simply not enough

1552
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,820
effective number

1553
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,400
Organisms have long been able to manage this oxygen

1554
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,400
BOSS movement

1555
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,900
All of us breathe in oxygen

1556
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,100
we do things with it

1557
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,500
I'm here to talk about a relatively simple

1558
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,100
This is what our lab is doing

1559
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,700
It's really easier to do

1560
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,900
It is not just H2 plus O2 to change water directly

1561
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,900
I just do a simple response is this

1562
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,900
O2 receives an electron to become superoxide

1563
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:36,900
This superoxide is receiving electrons to turn into hydrogen peroxide in two instructions

1564
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,400
There is a efficacious number that looks like this

1565
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,900
It's called SOD

1566
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,900
super oxo coal

1567
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,400
it is a coal

1568
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:52,400
Of course, other effects can be used later to turn this into water and oxygen.

1569
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,400
Then I can raise it and then dig it up.

1570
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,900
Its last can turn O2 into H2

1571
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,500
This is a reaction to the grading we just talked about

1572
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,500
It's Yang Ji's reaction

1573
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,120
I donâ€™t need the common people to tell me to help me make an effect

1574
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,000
But this effect, if you really take it seriously

1575
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
It feels like you have to raise a lot of big factories

1576
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Then go to performance

1577
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That is also an important thing

1578
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Is there a way we can make a compound

1579
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,500
That compound mimics this potency

1580
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,000
This is bionic

1581
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
If you make this compound to imitate this effect

1582
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Then let's see the effect

1583
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
What's the result in the middle

1584
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It doesn't matter what this page does to protein and what to us

1585
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Let's look at the middle one

1586
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
on the next page

1587
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
it's here

1588
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,000
This is the only chemical structure that appears in my entire speech

1589
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
I'm sorry if you don't study chemistry imitation

1590
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I only focus on a copper

1591
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
There's copper with a bunch of protein molecules in the middle

1592
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
there today

1593
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Focus on this

1594
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
This copper is the center of its active point

1595
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I just talked about this super sheep molecule

1596
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Souff Osley reacted to him and became O2

1597
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
B has O2 coming out

1598
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
copper becomes copper

1599
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,020
Then it becomes H2O2 with another long-term oxygen molecule.

1600
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,640
The reaction I'm talking about now is this

1601
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,640
Haven't used that electrical response yet

1602
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,640
The electrical reaction requires the final change to water

1603
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,040
let's start with this

1604
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,040
Half of it is made by this Mars point

1605
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,740
But carefulness on the side is absolutely necessary

1606
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:22,240
And this bridge to achieve such a central point

1607
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:26,240
The large pile of amine bricks next to it finally surrounded a very complicated result

1608
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,240
then we want to say

1609
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,240
I first synthesize a molecule

1610
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,240
like this part

1611
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,240
and placed inside a porous material

1612
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,240
like the outside part

1613
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,240
I typed it like this

1614
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,240
Here is my bionic method

1615
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,240
we won't talk about the details

1616
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,240
Chemosynthesis looks like a bit of a nuisance

1617
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,240
But it's not difficult

1618
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,240
it's my hole

1619
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,240
that hole

1620
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,240
Didn't I just say that I make hole materials

1621
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,240
delivery is possible

1622
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,300
Gas fluid enters quickly

1623
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:04,560
Then these molecules loaded are my

1624
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,360
mimic the molecule that eliminates

1625
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,160
it's going to be my catalyst

1626
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,200
its synthesis gas has pentagon

1627
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,560
I'm afraid I won't go into the details of its catalytic reaction here.

1628
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,360
This is what you will talk about if you are in the chemistry semester

1629
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:20,960
it is a circular reaction

1630
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:21,960
the point is to say

1631
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,560
This will be disconnected when the reaction is in the middle

1632
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,260
This chemical room needs to be disconnected

1633
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,160
If this molecule is in aqueous solution, it will not be able to do work.

1634
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,320
this loop won't run

1635
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,720
because it has to be picked up again

1636
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,320
It won't work if you take it back

1637
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,120
Just break up, break up, run away

1638
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,520
But I use this hole to lift it

1639
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:39,320
I just imitate it. The simple pendulum is the skeleton.

1640
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,120
like this

1641
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:44,920
i produce

1642
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:49,720
Use this molecule to sense this Super Oxide

1643
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,320
Super Oxide is a

1644
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,920
produced by an enzyme reaction

1645
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,920
I'm going to generate this superoxide molecule

1646
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,120
to generate light

1647
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,680
Then detect with this

1648
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,100
The way we detect its activity is by saying

1649
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:09,500
How much catalytic converter is needed

1650
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,200
can cut it in half

1651
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,700
This is called IC50

1652
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:20,400
IC50 Let's do 0 hours and 20

1653
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,500
IC50 means that the higher the worse

1654
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
because you need a lot of catalyst

1655
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,500
to achieve the same effect

1656
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,500
the higher the worse

1657
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,300
This is our catalyst itself

1658
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,300
did not do other things

1659
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,300
didn't let go and didn't do anything

1660
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,300
it's inactive

1661
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,800
And the activity is not good

1662
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,300
50%

1663
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,300
After a design of the material which moves in various ways

1664
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,300
side mimic protein

1665
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,300
surrounding structure

1666
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,300
try to imitate it

1667
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,300
because we know protein

1668
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:50,300
the result of that pin count

1669
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:54,300
I can get down to 1.9 at my best

1670
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,300
Of course, this is not as good as the real effect.

1671
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,300
This real effect has an IC50 of 0.9

1672
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,100
already very very good

1673
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,500
Then I want to tell you one thing is to say

1674
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,900
don't you use platinum

1675
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,500
you do this

1676
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,900
It's the reduction reaction

1677
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,800
originally was

1678
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,500
what all animals do

1679
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,500
Why are you going for platinum?

1680
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,400
should go this way

1681
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,700
but now

1682
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,300
Almost no one goes this way yet

1683
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,500
But I think it will be needed in the future

1684
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,500
a path that needs to be taken

1685
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,900
I won't talk about the details

1686
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,100
This is a lot of material

1687
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:32,100
Various Designs for Being Human

1688
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,700
i'm not going to be here today

1689
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,000
good

1690
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,300
The final overall effect is this

1691
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,700
he reacted

1692
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,700
use one

1693
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,300
simulated artificial effect

1694
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,900
to achieve this

1695
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:48,700
add in small portions

1696
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,300
Kong Dong's material

1697
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
Of course next we should do this

1698
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,900
Convert this again to one-half of the feed water

1699
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
The other level of response is the new

1700
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,600
it all adds up to

1701
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I want to finally make this Fuel Electronics Singayang

1702
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Generate this electricity and water

1703
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Of course it's still early

1704
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But this is a bionic idea

1705
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
rather than an idea with an industrial catalytic period

1706
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Ok, finally I should make a short structure

1707
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
what i'm talking about today is

1708
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Using Power in an Energy Problem

1709
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
our generation

1710
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
and the problem that the next generation may face

1711
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
We will eventually convert to the sun's

1712
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
We're going to design a chemical solar electron

1713
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
convert solar energy into chemical

1714
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
or fuel electronics

1715
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
convert to sunny

1716
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
which is then converted into electricity

1717
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
The problem faced is to manage the light

1718
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Facing problems to manage water

1719
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Facing Problems To Manage Gas

1720
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
also manages catalytic

1721
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
every step i think

1722
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
can be done with bionic methods

1723
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
all can

1724
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
If that day comes, we should do it very cheaply

1725
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
to use the sun

1726
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
At that time there was a second process

1727
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Come out and build a big project to do these things

1728
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
produce it

1729
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I don't expect it to be built any time soon

1730
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
But it's worth sitting here and thinking about it

1731
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Especially the Academia Sinica should have a lot of energy to do this

1732
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Before doing this, we need to know a lot of things

1733
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
because it is a design

1734
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
The principle of design What is the design principle of bionics

1735
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
we need to understand it

1736
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
we don't just look at it

1737
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Sometimes you look at its appearance for a long time

1738
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I really don't know what it does

1739
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Like the fine algae just mentioned

1740
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
you see it looks beautiful

1741
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
but don't know what it does

1742
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Principles of Design

1743
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
In addition, I am afraid that not all of them are self-installed.

1744
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Creatures are all self-installed

1745
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Self-loading from the bottom up

1746
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We may also have to go from top to bottom

1747
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
some designs

1748
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
these combined

1749
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Of course these things are cross-cutting

1750
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,200
chemistry physics biology

1751
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,500
Co-layer

1752
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:06,800
the last one

1753
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,300
Combination across domains

1754
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:10,500
such a thing

1755
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,100
i think it's

1756
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,100
an idea i'd love

1757
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,600
family language propaganda

1758
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,300
convey

1759
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,000
The last word is about the students

1760
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,000
how did you do it

1761
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,800
to do these interdisciplinary learning

1762
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
some things i'm doing now

1763
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,500
do this

1764
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,700
middle school textbook

1765
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,000
design

1766
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,500
my Ministry of Education said

1767
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,600
Although my Ministry of Education does not sell books

1768
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,000
But they are developing teaching materials

1769
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,000
never done well

1770
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I think it is not put this

1771
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,200
A good combination of life technology and natural science

1772
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,800
You now know that there is nature in the country

1773
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,000
and living technology

1774
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,600
Then everyone recognizes life technology

1775
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,800
public welfare

1776
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,200
nature is physics

1777
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
physical chemistry lesson by lesson

1778
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,200
In fact, Guo Zhongyou did the same thing.

1779
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,200
just deal with the mage

1780
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,000
but

1781
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You have to be the last to enter the battle

1782
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,000
The basic principles of physical chemistry biological

1783
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,600
and how did he design a thing

1784
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,600
His design in a living organism is

1785
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,000
very complicated very complicated

1786
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
we have some design ideas

1787
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
in student education

1788
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,200
I think it's quite necessary

1789
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,400
if it can be integrated

1790
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,600
learn early

1791
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,000
New Year's Eve Music Learning

1792
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,000
and then do this comparison

1793
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
The so-called integrative biology

1794
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Integrative Biology Words

1795
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Finally a wonderful infrastructure

1796
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Fantastic applications may develop

1797
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
ok i will stop here today

1798
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Finally, thank you Nie Ting

1799
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
and many of my collaborators

1800
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
and my students

1801
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
thank you all

1802
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Thanks

1803
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,740
There's still a lot of time

1804
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:06,540
If you want to ask a certain teacher

1805
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:09,140
He's at Nanotech and this

1806
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,520
this benefit

1807
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,020
concept words

1808
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,860
let's open the discussion first

1809
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,960
ask a professor

1810
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:22,760
About your nano-bionic materials

1811
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,260
Is it for our human body

1812
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:27,140
suffering from bone

1813
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,140
What do patients with this disease have

1814
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:35,000
What are the benefits?

1815
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,040
Thanks

1816
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,700
i'm not a doctor

1817
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,880
So I'm afraid I can't say

1818
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,980
directly to a patient

1819
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:48,280
I can only talk about it from the point of view of material concept

1820
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,320
If he wants to be a material senior

1821
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,320
The last thing he might have done was an artificial skeleton

1822
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,520
we are all now

1823
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,420
with artificial bones

1824
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:57,020
material artificial bone

1825
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,220
Mainly too metal and metal

1826
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,840
But one day maybe we can emulate it a little better

1827
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,540
it is relatively light

1828
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,100
and from time to time technology

1829
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,360
Maybe it's something like bones with zero calcium acid and slowly do it

1830
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:14,240
But it's still far away

1831
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,240
At present, Taihe gold is used to make artificial bones

1832
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,040
But the surface treatment is to prevent kidney

1833
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,040
make it biocompatible

1834
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,040
If this is to that extent

1835
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,240
Materials used

1836
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,340
if not to that point

1837
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,700
Of course you should eat more calcium

1838
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,900
eat more vitamins

1839
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:33,900
dorsese sun

1840
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,900
This is quite necessary

1841
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:49,900
we see the same creatures

1842
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:51,300
words like bones

1843
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,800
It can grow as big as Konglong

1844
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,300
It can be as small as a mouse bone

1845
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:01,180
you see that algae now

1846
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,400
it has a very complex structure

1847
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,840
Then there's no way we'll find that

1848
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,280
Like that factor that makes the bones grow and shrink

1849
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,280
Scale up that slender structure

1850
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:16,440
to the size we want to apply

1851
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,880
if i knew how the lab did it

1852
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,280
Maybe it can, but the creature has a certain size

1853
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,080
Slender is a single celled organism

1854
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,080
Its creatures are born so small

1855
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,080
micron, but human words are far, far away from this

1856
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,080
to make such a good structure

1857
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,880
I at least admit I don't know how to make it up

1858
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,720
We have to make a big decision

1859
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:43,880
it's a mess it has holes

1860
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,280
but the shape is ugly

1861
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,680
No it's not easy to control it's that big

1862
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,780
Our control is from small to high

1863
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:56,320
The harder it is to control, most people think that

1864
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,680
big good control no

1865
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,080
Because if it wants to be self-assertive, use chemistry to let it be self-assertive

1866
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
It's getting harder and harder to control

1867
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
i mean

1868
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Konglong like the same bone

1869
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
it can grow so big

1870
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
The mouse has such a small bone

1871
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
between them to control it

1872
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Factors that can grow so big

1873
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
or long so small factor

1874
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
There should be a mechanism

1875
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It must have a genetic component

1876
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
there is a mechanism

1877
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
That mechanism can be found

1878
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
and then apply it to something else

1879
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
words in a way

1880
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
We genetically modify

1881
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Can make a bigger animal benefit

1882
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
But this is still somewhat limited

1883
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
perhaps

1884
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
But the control of our creatures

1885
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
We don't do it casually, do we?

1886
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
There is also this ethical issue

1887
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
these questions

1888
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
But if we talk about experimental flow synthesis

1889
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
there is no way

1890
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Because this is what I just said

1891
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I don't know what you mean by creature control

1892
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Biocontrol for genetic modification

1893
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
yes to some extent

1894
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:00,500
have

1895
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,720
Even if it is good, I just want to ask

1896
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,800
I just saw it in a header

1897
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,920
There is a picture about that ultraviolet light

1898
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:17,320
its effect on the surface properties of the object

1899
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,960
like the surface of carbon dioxide

1900
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:21,540
Then it should be in that

1901
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,440
Changes in water clarity and water transport

1902
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:28,120
it is a molecule above

1903
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,620
That molecule deforms when it shines light on it

1904
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,420
That head is a molecule of oil

1905
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:35,820
it stands up and feels like oil

1906
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:38,360
and then give it the overdrive result

1907
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,020
It's more oily and more watery

1908
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,780
But if you turn on the power

1909
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,860
Its molecular deformation will come down like this

1910
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:47,160
Exposed is another form of molecule

1911
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,620
it can do this

1912
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:49,920
So this charge

1913
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,720
In addition, pH control is also available

1914
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,660
it can control a surface

1915
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:57,080
To change its water-clearing and water-transmitting properties

1916
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,860
Hello, Mr. Mono, I just want to ask for advice

1917
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,100
Just like you do with the refugee materials

1918
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,700
Like controlling the PH value

1919
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,640
Would it make a difference that

1920
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,040
The body size is different like this

1921
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,740
That is, relatively speaking, the pH value is important for living things.

1922
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:16,900
Will it affect him?

1923
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,440
Then another question is to say

1924
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,540
If you are making refugee material

1925
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:22,780
Like now maybe doing some chemical batteries like this

1926
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:24,840
If it is really applied to the human body

1927
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,180
during its manufacture

1928
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,900
like some refugee particles would say

1929
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,940
some powder layers during the manufacturing process

1930
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:31,340
cause harm to a person

1931
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,380
Even when it is really applied to the human body

1932
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:36,080
can't be ruled out

1933
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:40,940
Letâ€™s talk about refugeesâ€™ impact on the human body

1934
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:41,980
the bad words

1935
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,180
I really don't know a lot of things now

1936
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,380
You just don't want to eat indiscriminately.

1937
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:49,880
Then what I'm talking about doesn't apply to the human body.

1938
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,780
i don't have today

1939
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,380
I'm not talking about medicine tomorrow

1940
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:55,280
what you'll swallow when you make the wrong food

1941
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,340
all on one device

1942
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:58,280
that should be fine

1943
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,280
we don't just try

1944
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,260
It's a battery, right?

1945
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:04,000
this part

1946
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:05,760
still good

1947
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,400
But it's true that biological control is on the way

1948
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,160
Bi our laboratory control is much higher

1949
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,560
Our laboratory can change the pH arbitrarily

1950
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,860
What is the difference in the configuration of the material made by different pH

1951
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,260
Biology doesn't have that many options

1952
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:19,600
Its PH is around seven o'clock

1953
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,460
but it can do so many things

1954
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,860
it can still be controlled to

1955
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,360
Many chemical reactions if in neutral

1956
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,700
hard to do can't do it

1957
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,400
but it has no valid number

1958
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,500
it does not catalyze

1959
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,200
So the reaction math speeds up

1960
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,300
so

1961
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,100
Why when the pH value is lower

1962
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,600
Its crystallization period is smaller and more irregular

1963
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,000
Not necessarily not necessarily

1964
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,900
not necessarily not necessarily

1965
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,600
I don't know you want to take a material not necessarily

1966
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:45,500
what is not necessarily

1967
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:46,600
uncertain

1968
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,000
Where is MX

1969
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,100
that's not necessarily

1970
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,000
That's what we want to control

1971
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,800
Tell me about one of my articles

1972
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,100
i know what you're going to say

1973
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,100
The nano hole

1974
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:00,760
Dioxide series material

1975
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,960
Then P is also empty

1976
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:03,400
its big horns right

1977
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,000
yes

1978
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,400
But there are other variations

1979
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,000
Or if you change the temperature and change the gas

1980
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,400
it's not the same

1981
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,000
I can't go into details about this.

1982
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,800
that's right

1983
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,000
I probably know about your temperature problem

1984
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
maybe ask again

1985
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
behind this side

1986
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Beyond the level of this puzzling invention

1987
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
a lot of this hygiene

1988
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
All at the level of difficulty invented

1989
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
right

1990
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
especially sick

1991
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
right

1992
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
it's a virus

1993
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
it seems

1994
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
We call it this breeding

1995
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
its energy

1996
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
out of its control

1997
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
These problems are solved

1998
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Then we are confused about the material

1999
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Have you learned much about this?

2000
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Learn from viruses

2001
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
virus it's

2002
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
may say these things

2003
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
its handed over to technology

2004
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
it's not interested in itself

2005
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,260
Process Metabolism doesn't do these things

2006
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,100
that's a good idea

2007
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,240
Someday I will make a nano show

2008
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,000
to invade a cell

2009
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,160
Let the cells do what I want

2010
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,160
maybe one day

2011
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,300
But this requires a thorough understanding of life

2012
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,160
I think we're pretty good at this

2013
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,960
because you're here to be you

2014
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,800
I mentioned this self-installation

2015
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,000
Safe assembly

2016
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,100
What is our mechanism for Safe assembly?

2017
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:33,100
simple

2018
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,000
If, for example, a surface mono layer

2019
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:35,800
Safe assembly

2020
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,800
like the outside world

2021
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,200
what does professor tao yutai do

2022
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,000
that understands quite

2023
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,400
that is very restricted

2024
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:42,160
very limited

2025
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,000
But if a three-dimensional structure

2026
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Then, if you take the level

2027
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,500
really know very little

2028
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,300
so many things are

2029
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,640
just wear L

2030
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:53,600
have to try more

2031
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,240
But there will be some hints and some conjectures

2032
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,200
but no good theory

2033
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
you do those things

2034
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
For mentioning this imitative word

2035
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
generally speaking

2036
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
is doing the most on the fly

2037
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
also compare the best

2038
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
that this

2039
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
words in chemistry

2040
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I feel like I did it late

2041
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
How far are you doing now?

2042
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
really

2043
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It's a lot worse

2044
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
relatively late start

2045
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Because this series of Nano moves it is very complicated

2046
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It first has a joint structure

2047
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Then it will be difficult for you to get out

2048
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
The second is like schooling out something like this

2049
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
it is very finely conditioned

2050
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
you don't look at it this center

2051
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
the water pipe

2052
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Everything around will be affected

2053
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
It is difficult for us to imitate it completely

2054
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
So the so-called bionics sometimes

2055
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
That is to say, it is inspired to do this

2056
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
behind that

2057
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
that

2058
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
if the creature size

2059
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Now some genetic engineering

2060
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:00,000

2061
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,700
Or use artificial hormones

2062
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:06,500
actually allows fish to grow much faster or triple in size

2063
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,700
someone did it

2064
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,500
Like Shamon now with genetic engineering

2065
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,000
But it seems that I have just been allowed to work

2066
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,700
So how about being listed in that European country?

2067
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,300
If you have a virus

2068
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:19,400
Many people now use genetically modified viruses

2069
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,000
So this virus can help you make protein

2070
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,400
Or the tool of Ganggene delivery

2071
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,700
This machine does a lot

2072
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,700
But this is not completely artificial like yours.

2073
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,400
is this genetic modification

2074
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,600
But here comes a problem

2075
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,300
Ask Professor Mao

2076
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,200
I just mentioned that it's useful

2077
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:40,300
The method of life is afraid of substances to replace this SOD

2078
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,700
So it can be used as a valid number

2079
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,400
Now in terms of reproductive energy

2080
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,500
Many people use Sanway efficacious numbers

2081
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,700
The Sanway effect is very difficult to produce

2082
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:50,400
then the wood is very hard

2083
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,800
very difficult to digest

2084
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,300
Then you see, it means using your inexplicable technology

2085
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,300
Replacing reproductive energy in the future

2086
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,200
to the possibility of digesting wood into energy

2087
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,600
How high is the new chance

2088
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,400
The bionic one now

2089
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:07,100
efficacies to decompose that

2090
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,400
made of fiber

2091
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,900
Can still make considerable progress

2092
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:13,400
But the hardest is the wooden number

2093
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,100
that part of the wooden number

2094
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,900
really difficult

2095
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,100
let me see

2096
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:20,800
I can't imitate that effect

2097
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,400
natural efficiency

2098
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,600
You can decompose that part of the wooden number

2099
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,600
Do you know what I mean

2100
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,200
Fiber count is relatively easy is some

2101
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,700
Lie together and cut that middle off

2102
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,900
But woody numbers are more complicated

2103
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,300
a natural wood

2104
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:36,200
it's very complicated inside

2105
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,600
we also

2106
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,600
There is no way to deal with it all

2107
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,700
but in progress

2108
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:42,700
so

2109
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,300
is there any problem

2110
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:51,200
or

2111
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,300
This because it does not specify

2112
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,100
just click

2113
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,000
press the green one

2114
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,900
good

2115
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,900
good

2116
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,000
Because I think bionic words

2117
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,760
just like nature fucks

2118
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,760
sometimes not very strong

2119
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,760
why

2120
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,360
Because nature's requirements are different from our requirements

2121
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,760
no the same

2122
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,760
for example

2123
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,000
In Taiwan we all like to make money first

2124
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,440
the words of nature

2125
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,560
I guess the idea of â€‹â€‹making money isn't enough

2126
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,360
it may be survival first

2127
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,360
So play today like a natural gymnastics

2128
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:28,160
I think sometimes it's not very strong

2129
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,360
Should I say yes

2130
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,960
In addition to operating

2131
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,320
You are like these rises of nature

2132
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,320
inspiration

2133
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,520
yeah i just mentioned

2134
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,920
In fact, many jobs are like this now

2135
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,520
otherwise

2136
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,360
We are now singing the high profile of this innovation

2137
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,560
simply impossible

2138
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,560
Yes, from this body to

2139
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,520
in my speech today

2140
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,160
I did not put the Bio-Memetic

2141
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:52,120
Let me distinguish between these two Inspires

2142
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,960
maybe i should make it next time

2143
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,120
better distinction

2144
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,280
In fact many jobs are Bio-Inspired

2145
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,520
no

2146
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,900
imitated but by his natural

2147
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,400
to spark your imagination

2148
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,700
Many jobs are of the form

2149
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,200
i think this is

2150
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,600
He should be distinguished

2151
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,300
Because I heard stuff stuff

2152
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,500
materials of nature

2153
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,300
especially hard materials

2154
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,500
it has few basic elements

2155
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,000
It is all structured

2156
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,400
it is structured

2157
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:24,400
the technology of our characters

2158
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,400
It's just a little bit different

2159
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,000
on the contrary

2160
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,900
We say that the basic elements are many

2161
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,300
The middle of the result

2162
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,900
The so-called structured

2163
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:33,900
not too much

2164
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,200
But workers we seem

2165
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:38,100
less natural materials

2166
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,100
Its optimization is very good

2167
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,900
Yes, this understanding is very

2168
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,400
Nature has dozens of years

2169
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,600
we don't have that long

2170
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,500
they have thirty one years

2171
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,300
progress slowly

2172
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:53,100
to evolve him

2173
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,500
right

2174
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,100
we don't have that long

2175
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:56,600
so

2176
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,500
Especially since I just said a lot

2177
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,900
is playing now

2178
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,600
Existing theme

2179
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,000
so we are still learning

2180
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,900
we are really far behind

2181
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:06,840
talk to nature

2182
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:08,340
still a lot worse

2183
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,000
So we have to learn from nature

2184
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,440
ok thanks Kohman

2185
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:15,540
is there any problem

2186
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:20,600
well, talk about nothing

2187
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:21,700
we'll be a drummer later

2188
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:23,740
Thank you Professor Nakahara

2189
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,040
Jin Xia's speech

2190
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,440
Thank you for your participation

2191
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:26,900
Thanks
