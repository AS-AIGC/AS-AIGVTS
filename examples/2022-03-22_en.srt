Academia Sinica's 110-year Knowledge Trial

14
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,680
Dean Wang Shijie's popular science lecture begins

15
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,600
Please invite Director Zeng Guoxiang of the Secretariat to host for us

16
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,000
Family members of Academician Wang, Director Lei's speaker today

17
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,680
All advanced students present

18
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,800
Good night everyone online

19
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,840
I am Zeng Guoxiang, Director of the Secretariat of the Chinese Academy

20
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,680
The secretariat is also a series of knowledge experiments

21
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,000
The organizer of this lecture by Dean Gu

22
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
Originally this lecture should be given by us

23
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
Vice President Wang personally hosted but because

24
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
In fact, something happened, so please let me host it instead of him.

25
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Then there is a huge difference between my academic second and the associate dean.

26
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's just that everyone is here today, the important thing is not the host

27
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The most important thing today is of course our keynote speaker

28
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I believe that everyone is also here to admire the name.

29
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Because the Director of Lei, Mr. Lei Xiangning

30
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He is a very famous and outstanding historian in Taiwan

31
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
In fact, he graduated from the Chemistry Department of National Taiwan University.

32
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
PhD in History of Science from the University of Chicago

33
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So this is crossing a big boundary

34
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then his research works are very many, very profound.

35
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Moreover, his most important works are published by famous foreign university presses.

36
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
including his alma mater's prestigious University of Chicago Press

37
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So today I have the opportunity to give you the opportunity to

38
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Gathering together, Mr. Lin Ting's speech I believe is a guarantee for everyone

39
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Very enjoyable evening myself and a lover of reading

40
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
A man of history is not an expert in history

41
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,440
Well, what we're going to talk about today is actually very interesting.

42
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
Because today, of course, in the past two or three years, everyone knows

43
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
Our lives have been greatly affected by the epidemic

44
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,880
But in fact, the epidemic has changed human society

45
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,040
Of course he didn't die today, everyone probably knows that.

46
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,160
In fact, for example, in the 1930s there was a very famous

47
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,280
This so-called Chinese tuberculosis is a mystery

48
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,920
Because in fact at the time

49
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,680
China is not the most industrialized country

50
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,440
But the death rate of people in China who suffer from tuberculosis

51
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,560
four times that of a country like the UK

52
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
That sometimes seems like such a mystery

53
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,680
Maybe our on-site factory store is interesting, it's a biomedical institute

54
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,640
This may not be the person who actually made the vaccine

55
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Questions that can be answered by people who actually do medical treatment

56
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,360
This is through history

57
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,680
Through historians' re-combating in the beginning

58
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,680
Come and tell us to solve this very interesting mystery

59
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,120
and then through this question

60
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
can make us reflect

61
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,900
Today, we are also living with this era of vaccines.

62
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,000
How do we get from vaccines

63
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,700
Then reflect on ourselves from this disease

64
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,500
Relationships with people, society, and society

65
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,200
And then go on to allow ourselves to understand the history of infectious diseases on our bodies

66
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,500
have a richer understanding

67
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
And then to our own times

68
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,900
Especially civilized, East Asian, these issues of modernity

69
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,000
have a chance to reflect

70
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,500
then today we will

71
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,200
Wait a minute and I can invite this teacher to give a speech

72
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
In the end, everyone can probably tell from the beginning.

73
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,400
Also, he was talking about a vaccine

74
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
no immediate relationship

75
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,700
i think we have dinner today

76
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,700
This Chinese dining table has a rotating table

77
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,300
His birth through this revolving table

78
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,900
What I want to tell us is exactly the mystery I left just now.

79
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,200
It is China's understanding and fame

80
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
As for the detailed reasons

81
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,800
Shall we give Mr. Lei a big round of applause?

82
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,900
come and speak for us

83
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,200
thank you thank you everyone

84
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
my mic is on

85
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
open?

86
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
both are open

87
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The back seems to be open

88
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's good

89
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
good

90
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you very much for the introduction of Yimei, the head of Pearl

91
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
very honored

92
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
then i feel very honored

93
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I had the opportunity to do this with you here today

94
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Lecture by Dean Wang Shijie of Academia Sinica

95
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Especially this relative of President Wang is here

96
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because it was actually last year that I had the chance

97
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Until that is to say, the European and American office opposite the technical office

98
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
that beautiful building

99
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was designed by Ms. Wang Qinghua, the daughter of President Wang.

100
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
just know a lot of his stories

101
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So it's a double honor

102
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
I am very glad to have the opportunity to do this report with you.

103
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,400
So hello friends here and friends online

104
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,960
That's the topic I want to talk about today

105
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,800
I want to say that when you see it, you don’t know how it feels

106
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,340
should come to mind right away

107
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,440
What is a Chinese revolving table

108
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,000
mask good thanks

109
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,520
Thanks

110
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,600
That is, let me start with our topic and introduce to you

111
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,420
The main axis that I will talk about today

112
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,260
First of all, we are all so familiar that it may be difficult for us to imagine

113
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,100
Foreigners in this picture will be very surprised to find

114
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,400
There's something on this table they've never seen

115
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,680
a piece of furniture

116
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,500
It's the revolving table we just talked about

117
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,580
Then this is a very familiar thing to us

118
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,420
So I think it might be hard for you to imagine saying

119
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,480
In fact, before the 20th century, on the Chinese dining table

120
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
Such a convenient piece of furniture does not exist

121
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,540
This is actually a new invention to the 20th century

122
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
right

123
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,860
and then the second

124
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Japan and Korea who also use chopsticks

125
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We can't see the carousel either

126
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Unless you go to his Chinese restaurant

127
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
In fact, the Japanese think

128
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This is what they invented

129
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
that's a

130
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Be independent of me for stories other than today's story

131
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you are interested, I will talk to you later

132
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that's the second place

133
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
may surprise everyone

134
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The third point is

135
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's not just a simple piece of furniture

136
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
when it was invented

137
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
is closely related to public health

138
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
even has an english name

139
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's called Hygienic Chinese Dining Table

140
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
A Chinese sanitary dining table

141
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So it has something to do with our current epidemic situation.

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And what?

143
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Its inventor was in fact

144
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Many people know today

145
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Dr. Wu Liande

146
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He is the Chinese

147
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Citizens in British Malaya

148
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A Doctor of Medicine from Jianqiao University

149
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is that

150
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And it's important

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He is recognized for his research

152
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In 1935, he received the Liu Beier medical certificate

153
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
nomination for a scholarship

154
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,800
So should be the first to be nominated

155
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,100
A person of Chinese descent who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine

156
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,200
now about him

157
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,300
he's become very very famous now

158
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,800
partly because

159
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,700
After the discovery of the COVID outbreak

160
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,800
everyone thinks

161
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,200
The inventor of the anti-epidemic mask we wear today

162
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
maybe it's him

163
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,200
In fact, most of our inventions have previous

164
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
previous story

165
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
It's hard to say who invented

166
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,900
But now if you go to Google

167
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,300
Go check CAN

168
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,500
some mainstream media

169
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
will say

170
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,800
This is the time when the Manchurian plague was fought five years ago

171
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
From 1910 to 1911

172
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,000
invented this

173
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,400
It is the first pioneer in the use of anti-epidemic masks by humans

174
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,300
So he's now become this international celebrity

175
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,400
When I first started researching him

176
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
In fact, it was the situation when SARS was over.

177
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,100
that is such a person

178
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,400
so think about it

179
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,500
It's actually an interesting story

180
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,900
One we use everyday at home

181
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,100
we even thought

182
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It may have been used for hundreds of thousands of years

183
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,840
very convenient piece of furniture

184
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,400
It actually had to wait until the 20th century for it to be invented

185
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
and still a

186
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,100
Invented by Nobel-Lectured Scientists

187
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,000
Think about it, if we now know

188
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,600
that our current dean

189
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Or the former vice president of Jianren

190
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,700
He actually designed it for us

191
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,200
an item on our dinner table at home

192
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,600
Everyone must be surprised, right?

193
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
So inside this shadow

194
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,900
In fact, it implies that

195
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,200
During our epidemic prevention process

196
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,700
In fact, some of them are very deep

197
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,300
into our daily life

198
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,400
and then become our

199
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,100
part of life

200
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
so my today

201
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,400
at that time

202
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
When Wuliande designed

203
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
is to solve a

204
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,300
The most important cause of death in China at that time

205
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,500
It's what Director Zeng mentioned just now.

206
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,900
It's Fei Jie and

207
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,000
so there's a very serious reason

208
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
and this

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,300
This photo and this article

210
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,200
on board

211
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
The National Medical Journal of China 的

212
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,900
The first issue of the first issue in 1915

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
As far as today's so-called Chinese Medical Journal

214
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,320
So you read an English medical journal

215
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
The first issue of the inaugural issue published a photo

216
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,760
Then to address the most important cause of death

217
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,400
But there is indeed one that none of us know today

218
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Furniture Invented in Taipei in the Second Century

219
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,320
So this is what I want to tell you today

220
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,200
So I want to share with you through this story

221
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,000
some bigger questions

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,280
So if the simplest speech

223
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,200
China is a very simple story

224
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,440
That is why the prevention and control of infectious diseases will promote

225
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,680
Nobel-Lecture Physician

226
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,880
Design a brand new daily necessities?

227
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,760
like i just said

228
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,800
if we want now

229
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
that our dean

230
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,760
Help us design supplies for our home

231
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,080
Everyone should be surprised, right?

232
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,440
But I'm in the process of solving this mystery

233
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Actually what I want to say is

234
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,680
we prevent the epidemic

235
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,200
In fact, everyone should feel

236
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,520
How much our lives have changed in the past two years

237
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,320
after two years

238
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
The whole world is different, right?

239
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,840
But the story I want to tell today is

240
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,320
In addition to the many changes we know

241
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,080
and some more

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,260
deep change

243
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,200
we may not realize so easily

244
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,360
There is a series of changes initiated

245
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,300
The anti-epidemic measures developed to combat infectious diseases

246
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,600
How has prompted a series of new developments

247
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,860
We may not often think of

248
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,960
Contains the new living appliances of our life

249
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,960
Awareness and feelings of a new body

250
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,260
change in your body

251
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,860
The sense of body has also changed

252
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
and your habit change

253
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,560
Sanitation habits have changed

254
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,020
The habit of speaking English is your second nature

255
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,720
right

256
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,520
You have changed in a profound sense

257
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,520
Even the relevant ethical values ​​have changed

258
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
and my generals and

259
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,720
Relationships and general boundaries have also changed

260
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,460
That's my topic at the end

261
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,220
Finally

262
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,220
Individual and group self-identities are also altered

263
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,220
so i think

264
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
I often pass this one

265
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,960
A specific story about the Chinese rotating ginseng pan

266
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,620
Then we see every day may not know

267
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,680
we have a history of this history

268
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,800
to make everyone feel

269
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,000
We are in the process of epidemic prevention

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
What profound changes have been caused

271
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
There are so many facets

272
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
And what?

273
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,800
These aspects are often not legal

274
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,200
not by thought

275
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,100
but in an instrumental or bodily way

276
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,400
changed us

277
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,600
become a part of us

278
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,200
In the end it means

279
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
If everyone thinks you're surprised too

280
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
This thing is actually a

281
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,200
If medical experts found out on a Japanese TV station

282
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,000
It provides a very important clue that

283
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,200
It is because we all think of epidemic prevention as

284
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
just to prevent contagion

285
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,400
and just help us to be healthy

286
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
we think of it as a tool

287
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,200
So we didn't realize the change

288
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,800
is a comprehensive cultural change

289
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
And implement it in our body

290
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
so we often

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,800
didn't realize the change

292
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,100
changing presence

293
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,000
That's a hidden history

294
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,500
That's one I want to share with you today

295
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
one

296
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,700
behind a big background

297
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,300
Of course one of them

298
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,100
I hope we

299
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
That is to say, when everyone listens to such a story

300
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
also feel that

301
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,600
Some epidemic prevention measures we usually think about

302
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,000
In fact, the impact on us

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
maybe more than we thought

304
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
There are many far-reaching

305
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,800
that's the one behind me

306
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
big idea

307
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,600
OK, so let's start talking about this now.

308
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
Why is his tuberculosis problem

309
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,800
He will think about this place

310
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
This is a Japanese book

311
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,900
First published in 1914 as Tuberculosis and Digestion

312
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,100
Diagram of the spreading system of fine infectious diseases

313
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,800
Then he talks about bubble contagion

314
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,500
That should be what we call today

315
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Droplet infection, right?

316
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,700
Then here we see a person

317
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,900
Then this person is actually a

318
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,200
tuberculosis patients

319
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,100
He already consciously wants to cover his mouth with his hand

320
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,000
but this drool

321
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,100
Then this picture may not be clear enough.

322
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,400
They are actually red dots

323
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,600
start cumming on this guy

324
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,100
So what am I talking about now?

325
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,500
this is the nineteenth century

326
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,400
very brilliant one

327
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,900
low blood breakthrough

328
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
to the bacteria

329
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The discovery of germ theory

330
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then I get from this

331
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,700
We're all too familiar with this now

332
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,000
So it may be difficult for everyone to imagine the feeling

333
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,500
The sense of breakthrough

334
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
just suddenly you feel

335
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
where you can't see

336
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,800
full of things that can make you sick

337
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,500
sick germs, right?

338
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
then the danger is everywhere

339
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,800
This is a

340
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,500
Such a huge change in worldview

341
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,700
so all of a sudden

342
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,400
Experts all over the world are busy doing it

343
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,900
Tell the public with various images

344
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,400
In fact, there are all kinds of dangers around you.

345
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,900
It's sprayed out here where you can't see it

346
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,700
All that comes out are red dots

347
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,200
brings countless dangers

348
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,600
then you should feel a sense of dread

349
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,300
Then look at this cup over here

350
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,900
It's also a red dot, right?

351
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,400
so after this

352
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,900
when you use someone else's cup

353
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,800
It's completely different from before

354
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,300
You'll feel like you're full of this germ

355
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,000
There are a lot of pictures showing you where it will happen

356
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
For example, before people would

357
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,600
That's not the one that flips the book, right?

358
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,900
Now you also think it might be a germ

359
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,400
even like us or that

360
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,900
It turns out that grandparents chewed up food and gave it to children

361
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,800
Now you think it's spreading germs too

362
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Even men's beards were shaved later

363
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,000
Because I think your beard is easy to hide germs

364
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,300
And the equipment in our home has changed too.

365
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,000
In the past, there were a lot of designs that were easy to accumulate dust, right?

366
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,400
Now you think there's germs hiding there

367
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,900
So in fact, learning from the novelty of this germ theory

368
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,100
It's just that people's lives have changed a lot

369
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,000
And one very important point

370
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,300
Is actually the concept of bacterial infection itself

371
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,000
is a major breakthrough in human thought

372
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,100
Because of course it wasn't until the nineteenth century that we had infectious diseases

373
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,600
We've all heard of the Black Death, haven't we?

374
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
So then the Black Death is said to have killed one-third of Europe's population at that time

375
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,900
So people have known for a long time that there will be some diseases

376
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
when it suddenly became popular

377
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Many people experience the same symptoms

378
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
mass death

379
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
but the point is

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
before the breakthrough of germ theory

381
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We think of people of this magnitude

382
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
died of the same disease

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This spotlight phenomenon

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
people will think that it must be

385
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
The power of concentrating light causes the phenomenon of concentrating light

386
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So what is the power of focus?

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
for example

388
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
if say yes

389
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
brand new tree

390
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
it could be cosmic influence

391
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Of course the place speaks

392
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
climate change

393
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Or let's talk about burial devices, right?

394
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
As a result of the environment where there is a burial vessel in this place

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
or say you say yes

396
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Like we talk about warming the mind, right?

397
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
is the power of gods and ghosts

398
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
just forget to imagine such a

399
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When a large-scale epidemic spreads rapidly

400
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
you will think so

401
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Must be the power of light

402
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
cause spotlight

403
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But after the germ theory happened,

404
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
we just started

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
able to imagine

406
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's not happening with spotlight power

407
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
this is one

408
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
one person to one person one person to one person

409
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,900
spread rapidly

410
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
You couldn't imagine before

411
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
The power of one person is passed on one by one

412
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,400
Can suddenly spread to many people

413
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,100
So what I want to say is

414
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,400
the discovery of animalism itself

415
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,600
It also constitutes a breakthrough point in our human thinking

416
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Feeling passed from person to person

417
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,700
Then it is possible to become a co-optic phenomenon

418
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,200
What is the simplest example of this

419
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
One of the most familiar

420
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,300
This method of spreading is actually computer poisoning

421
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,100
right

422
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,500
When one is poisoned, you can also be poisoned by millions

423
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,900
How would you describe it when it was poisoned?

424
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,100
It's about viral infection, right?

425
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,900
So the other way around is to say

426
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,200
This breakthrough model of viral and bacterial infection

427
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,700
becomes a model for our understanding of an other infection

428
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,000
Because before that people can't imagine

429
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,300
contagion like this is possible

430
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,400
So what I'm telling you now is that

431
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,000
This whole breakthrough has to do with germ theory

432
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,400
it represents a new

433
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,360
one thinking about things

434
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,400
A whole new way of thinking about things

435
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,400
that also has elements we are familiar with

436
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,600
talk like here

437
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,700
you want to talk to this patient

438
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,760
To maintain a relationship of more than three feet

439
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,360
or you will be infected

440
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,360
So you have to maintain a social distance

441
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,200
That is in such a context

442
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,760
just happened

443
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,660
Let's start thinking about what we're talking about

444
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,960
The Syndrome Problem

445
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,520
But despite this breakthrough in bacteriology

446
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,320
We just learned that bacterial contagion is conceivable

447
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,940
However, a later discovery was that

448
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,740
when you actually check

449
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,940
just to test later

450
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,940
most people have germs

451
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,280
Most people have tuberculosis

452
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,540
in that era

453
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,620
just someone having a seizure

454
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,540
Someone didn't have a seizure

455
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,140
In fact, from this point of view

456
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,480
There is no reason why the person is sick

457
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,180
It's not that he hasn't been exposed to the combined strain.

458
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,640
but to say

459
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,180
but other reasons

460
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,940
sorry i skipped a paragraph

461
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,140
I'll jump back and forth to talk about this passage

462
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,840
So the bacteria theory just now

463
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,000
The popularity of this concept

464
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,700
cause a lot of anxiety

465
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
a very famous anxiety

466
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,300
I'm here to tell you

467
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,200
it's about christianity

468
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
The Common Chalice Controversy

469
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
It's just that everyone knows

470
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,900
When Christians receive the Holy Communion

471
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,600
Why don't you just go up and drink in the same glass?

472
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,300
right

473
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,100
This is the insurance of Jesus Christ

474
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,800
to all the zune brothers

475
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Everyone also receives the insurance of Jesus Christ

476
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Then prove that you guys are brothers of Zune

477
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
But what?

478
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,000
Now you just learned that fine pregnancy

479
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Is there supposed to be on this cup?

480
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,400
Red dot, right?

481
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,600
Then you see a man ahead

482
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,500
when you keep coughing

483
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,000
You start to suspect this Zoney brother

484
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
In fact, it will bring a big

485
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,100
dangerous

486
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,300
but if you don't drink because of it

487
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,500
Wouldn't that be a clear violation

488
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Are the Zone brothers thinking right?

489
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,900
That is to say you are so out of touch

490
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,500
Make the people around you suspicious like this

491
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,200
he may be your relative

492
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,700
So this is after you invented the fine pregnancy theory

493
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,100
It caused a very big debate in the United States

494
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,600
Should we reform this

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,800
A reform seems to destroy an original symbolic meaning, right?

496
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,000
mutual acceptance

497
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,200
A ceremony of receiving insurance from the same cup

498
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,300
but in the end

499
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,000
By 1898

500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,800
Two-thirds of U.S. dioceses vote to decide

501
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,400
give up this chalice

502
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
can't use this cup anymore

503
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
then change to

504
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,000
change it to this

505
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,700
Everyone has a small cup for everyone

506
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,900
Everyone go up and get a glass

507
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,300
So you can see from this place that means

508
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,400
After the general popularity of drama theory at that time

509
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,600
People are very concerned about sharing a cup with others

510
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,700
share your drool

511
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,300
An unprecedented sense of fear

512
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,600
even willing to pay such a high price

513
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,000
destroy one of his symbolic meanings

514
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
you have to change it

515
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
then i just

516
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,400
I just mentioned the next one from here

517
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,900
says

518
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,100
So everyone thought

519
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,700
Syndrome is clearly an infectious disease.

520
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,900
but then it was

521
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,400
It turns out that almost everyone actually has combined bacteria

522
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Someone wants to get over it and then it's okay

523
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,400
So it's obvious that

524
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,900
This cannot be explained only by bacteria

525
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,900
So wait until that development from what we just talked about

526
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,400
By the time of the end of the nineteenth century

527
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,900
people will think that in fact

528
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,200
Whether you are sick or not

529
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,200
The key factor is not tuberculosis infection

530
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,800
but other issues

531
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,200
what is it like

532
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,800
like urbanization and industrialization

533
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,600
Ventilation and lighting, malnutrition, working hours, etc.

534
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,200
that is, the very poor

535
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,500
forced to live in terrible conditions

536
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,700
malnourished very poor

537
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,200
they have poor resistance

538
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,100
So they have to combine bacteria

539
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,700
So here's a classic in the history of medicine

540
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,200
叫The Making of a Social Disease

541
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
is the first to be considered

542
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,300
diseases caused by social factors

543
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,400
is what we would have thought to say

544
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,000
This Non-Combined Is an Infectious Disease

545
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,100
But now I realize

546
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Actually you don't have to fully focus there

547
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It is very important to say that your life

548
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Is it the one that has enough nutrients

549
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
If the environment it lives in is well ventilated and well lit

550
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
In fact, it is not easy to be infected

551
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There is also the issue of working hours

552
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So the disease becomes a

553
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Instead, we have a turning point

554
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What we learned is that

555
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
state intervention

556
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
For example, what we are talking about later

557
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
work eight hours

558
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
also related to this

559
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's also related to this

560
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And very strong like this picture you see

561
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
It talks about making of social disease

562
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I think those who are sick are actually poor

563
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
They were forced to live in an industrial environment

564
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
live in a crowded one

565
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Places with poor ventilation and lighting

566
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and that is to say bear

567
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
long hours of work

568
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That's why I'm sick

569
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So from this point of view

570
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
To solve the core problem of the disease

571
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
not to keep it from touching germs

572
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's about improving its living conditions

573
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Especially give it enough nutrition and so on

574
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,700
On the contrary, do you think that if you are a farmer

575
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,200
or those who live in the suburbs

576
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,700
They don't actually get that much

577
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,000
Not so easy to get tuberculosis

578
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,800
And because of this, when he was recuperating from tuberculosis

579
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,700
Often go to the mountains or the sea to recuperate

580
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,200
So the story I just told was

581
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,800
Bacteriology

582
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,700
But then tuberculosis has

583
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,300
Tuberculosis has been understood as a disease

584
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,900
That is why this disease has become

585
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,500
Does the country improve

586
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,100
The living environment of ordinary people is closely related to

587
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,100
like Japan

588
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,400
He was originally unwilling to solve this problem by the country.

589
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,900
Later, after the rise of communism

590
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
As far as the Japanese government thinks

591
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,100
must help

592
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,800
people improve his workers

593
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Especially the worker improves his living environment

594
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,000
Otherwise such a question

595
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,100
would become a hotbed of communism

596
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,500
That's the background of such a story

597
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,400
Then everyone can think of saying

598
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,200
If from this point of view

599
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
The second day of the 1924 season

600
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
China is definitely not an industrialized

601
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,240
Or a very highly urbanized country, right?

602
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,240
At that time it was said that more than 85% were farmers

603
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,740
So logically speaking

604
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,740
He shouldn't have that much of a FJH problem.

605
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,440
In fact, in the 19th century

606
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,640
Quite a lot of this missionary classroom in China also said

607
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,840
The Chinese don't look like Fei Jiehe's problem is too serious

608
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,340
there is such a saying

609
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
But then waited until after the 20th century

610
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,440
they feel

611
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,980
The problem of infectious diseases in China cannot be serious

612
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Because I think they have a lot of bad habits

613
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,980
That even later China's own Anti-aging Association

614
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,480
That is, Fei Jiehe was once translated as labor sickness

615
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,980
So it's the Anti-Age Society

616
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,480
They also use some statistics and estimates

617
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,780
And to describe China as a Feijiehe problem

618
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,280
very serious country

619
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,280
then he said

620
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Combined disease is the deadliest disease in China

621
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,780
Then China is affected by the combined disease all over the world

622
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,780
deepest cleansing country

623
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,780
green and original

624
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
underground tuberculosis patients

625
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:06,340
And then the death rate is at least four times higher than in the UK

626
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,840
is to create an image that is

627
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,840
this problem is very serious

628
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,340
Even more serious than some industrialized countries

629
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Even if you have heard

630
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
China is the sick man of East Asia

631
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,840
The imaginary disease should be tuberculosis

632
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
So from our point of view

633
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,840
This should be a pretty strange thing

634
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,340
You are obviously a basically agricultural country

635
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,340
why you got one

636
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,340
In fact, if we look at the nineteenth century

637
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
For example, about tuberculosis in Japan

638
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,340
It actually said it was low at the beginning

639
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,340
It is because it rose after industrialization

640
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Then change after rising

641
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Only if there are worker sanitation workers will they drop again

642
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
Logically speaking, you should be post-industrialized

643
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,340
You are the only one affected by this disease

644
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,340
But at the time these

645
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,340
The prison association has created an understanding

646
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,340
That is to say, China is not only seriously

647
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,340
And maybe it's the worst country in the world

648
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,340
In fact, in my research, there are

649
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,500
I have looked at the stats they use

650
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
At that time, China had nothing to do with

651
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,300
There are few relevant statistics

652
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,800
In many other cases, the use of

653
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,300
For example, what is the one in Shanghai?

654
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,500
Concession in Shanghai

655
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,400
or some other zero-tax data pieced together

656
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,200
So from this point of view

657
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,300
It doesn't necessarily have solid statistics behind it.

658
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,000
But they created such an image

659
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,500
Maybe it's because I hope the government and compatriots will pay attention to it.

660
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
created a

661
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
China has a very serious problem of combined disease

662
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
such a conclusion

663
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,000
but if you say that

664
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,500
then you clearly know

665
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,000
The Western consensus at the time was that

666
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,500
True Syndrome is very serious

667
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
It must be related to industrialization and urbanization

668
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,700
you become to explain

669
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,500
There is one that Mr. Zeng just mentioned

670
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
I call it the Chinese Syndrome Mystery

671
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
that is

672
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Such a disease is understandable in Europe, America and Japan

673
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Why in an agricultural society like China

674
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
will cause so many

675
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
they deeply hurt

676
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,800
It's like I can't understand

677
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,600
right

678
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,800
then

679
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,800
they use these

680
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
in the relevant researchers

681
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,400
To explain this phenomenon

682
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
proposed some very

683
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
A very special explanation is that

684
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
whatever the cause of the disease

685
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,400
The population distribution of patients, etc.

686
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,000
Combined diseases in China are very different from those in the West

687
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And it has a unique Chinese characteristic

688
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,600
how to say

689
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
we now give an example

690
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,600
study at the University of Chicago

691
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,000
Dr. Lai Daoyuan, who taught at Shanghai Medical College, said

692
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,600
Some people say that the amount of combined disease

693
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,200
It is entirely related to the economic level of the people.

694
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
as i just said

695
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,600
It's a socioeconomic disease

696
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,200
So it's not at all

697
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,400
All kinds of preventive work are irrelevant

698
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,600
He said it was a close observation

699
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,800
Although many people say

700
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,400
but i don't think it's a foregone conclusion

701
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,200
He said because

702
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,800
What about us

703
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,200
rich people in our country

704
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Unlike American capitalists

705
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,800
like to get together

706
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,000
everyone is very

707
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
live close together, a lot of people get together

708
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,500
I don't talk, and I don't like doing outdoor activities

709
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,500
And if you don't have the wind, the next generation is regarded as the standard of beauty

710
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,000
So that the chance of getting combined disease

711
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
call poor people more

712
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The Great Disparity Between China and Foreign Countries

713
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
say what they think

714
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,500
Chinese people with sickness and morality are totally different from Westerners

715
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,000
Because people who get a lot are rich

716
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Because they have some really bad habits

717
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,500
and cause them to get combined disease

718
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
So he cites a statistic

719
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Patients with combined disease in Guangzhou

720
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,500
First-class patients accounted for 8.4%

721
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,000
What about ordinary patients?

722
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That is, only 2% of civilians

723
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
three times worse

724
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
From this we can know that in China

725
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,500
why this happened

726
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
not economic factors

727
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
no nutritional factors

728
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
but other factors

729
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
what about further

730
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
They also cite many

731
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Statistical reports on relevant clinical

732
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
like this GA number

733
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,240
The result of his research is that

734
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
This is called Turbulic Losses in China

735
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,740
It is the combination of the lungs in China

736
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,500
His Beijing Indications Combination Diseases

737
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,080
10 years of this

738
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,380
Professor Ji Huanghao pointed out that

739
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,840
The real thing is that everyone in China has

740
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,580
The cause of combination disease is not what we just talked about

741
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,080
those socioeconomic and nutritional factors

742
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,680
but unhygienic habits

743
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,960
Chinese habits will inevitably lead to a sense of integration

744
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,200
Take a wide walk in the family

745
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,800
Small hotel at home or in the village

746
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Both sick and healthy people sleep on the same bed

747
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
It's just that they sleep too close

748
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
and then the second one

749
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Whether at home, office or on the street

750
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
habit of spitting

751
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
not only taken for granted

752
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
and very common

753
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
So this is the habit of talking about spitting

754
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
What about the third one?

755
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,800
After picking up food from the shared game

756
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,800
The chopsticks are delivered directly to everyone's mouth

757
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
So this is talking about communal food

758
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
That is, if there is a large bowl in the middle

759
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Your chopsticks go in to catch the cold

760
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
you put it in your mouth

761
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,900
So if you have tuberculosis

762
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,300
After next time you send your germs to the bowl

763
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,100
Then eat it for someone else

764
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,700
So he imagined it was because of your family

765
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,400
There are so many unhygienic habits at home

766
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,900
so lead to

767
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,300
say this disease

768
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,100
special one popular

769
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,300
And another reason

770
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,600
It's just that your family is very big

771
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,800
you are very many

772
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,100
And the way we get along is too intimate

773
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,400
He said that in China not only parents

774
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,600
even grandparents

775
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,400
Boshu Uncle and other male elder relatives

776
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,000
Gu Yi Shen

777
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Mother-in-law, aunt and other female elder relatives

778
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,400
Cousins, brothers, sisters, and other relatives of the same generation

779
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,600
And the servants have very close contact with children.

780
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,100
So what this imagines is that

781
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,800
in a very large family

782
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,400
many people in close proximity

783
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,000
Spread of disease as a result of communication

784
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,800
But in fact at that time very

785
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,900
Chinese people are not all big families

786
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,600
there are a lot of people

787
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,900
there are a lot of single people

788
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,300
So this is actually a

789
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
A problematic description of a Chinese family at that time

790
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But it also constituted the epidemiologist at that time

791
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
considered a major reason the disease was transmitted in China

792
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Okay, so from that point of view we take it back

793
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
As I just said, at the beginning of the 20th century

794
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
The mainstream thinks that Fei Jie is compared with Chen Yin

795
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
becomes a great contrast

796
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That is to say, Westerners at that time

797
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
or the predecessor of the then United Nations

798
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The Ministry of Health of the League of Nations has always emphasized that Fei Jiehe is a Social Disease

799
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But in the context of China

800
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It has turned into a Family Disease

801
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
based on family

802
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
And a disease that spreads in the family

803
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It does not stem from industrialization and urbanization

804
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And the representative patients are not poor

805
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Instead, they are rich people in big families who live a traditional life

806
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So it's not a social disease

807
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
but a family disease

808
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And it's a disease unique to a Chinese family

809
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This is equivalent to one of the

810
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
an important consensus

811
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That

812
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,500
I'm thinking when you're listening now

813
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Do you think it's a bit

814
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
far-fetched or unimaginable

815
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,000
people at that time would come like this

816
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Conceive your place

817
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
The reason next door is different from the whole world

818
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
But it was indeed a

819
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
public health experts

820
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,500
Even very credible public health experts

821
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,000
an idea promoted

822
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
For example, here is a

823
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,500
Female public health pioneers who once studied at Yale

824
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
Ge Chenghui

825
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,500
She's sick in her Chinese with combination

826
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,500
just talk about the Chinese

827
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
The relationship between Chinese people and combined disease

828
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
point out that the Chinese people have the above bad habits

829
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
So what?

830
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
so that only one family member

831
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
contracted disease

832
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
before long

833
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Half the family is a victim

834
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Therefore, in the past, combined disease was called a master.

835
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
I give this example to say

836
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
what do you see her image like

837
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
this is not a society

838
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
but to say

839
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
It was spread at home, right?

840
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
someone got it

841
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,700
soon everyone will have

842
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,900
And what about this matter

843
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,700
The Chinese knew it before

844
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,000
Because there is another person named Xijia in Chuanshilao.

845
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,500
Xijia disease

846
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,100
So he especially emphasized the word

847
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,500
It's the prison

848
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,800
it's actually interesting

849
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Because at that time in fact

850
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,200
That western doctor advocates the abolition of traditional Chinese medicine.

851
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
They hate using

852
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,300
traditional Chinese medicine vocabulary

853
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,700
Then why do you specifically use a

854
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,500
this looks like a weird

855
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,900
very strange word

856
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,600
It's especially interesting

857
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,200
a little bit reveals

858
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,900
Katsuragi would very much like to take advantage of an original

859
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,200
old vocabulary

860
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
to inspire everyone to a

861
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,800
inside the whole family

862
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,200
the disease spread

863
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,800
And an image that causes people to die

864
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
The prison is

865
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,600
Passing on the master prison is a kind of prison disease

866
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,500
This concept probably appeared around the seventh century

867
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,200
That basically reflects that

868
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,300
The Chinese at that time already knew

869
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,700
this

870
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,800
Tuberculosis is contagious

871
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,100
But what about their theory?

872
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Let's pass on the prison

873
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,140
That is, after one person dies

874
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,580
And then the worm after he died

875
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,380
leave his body

876
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,780
and ran to his family

877
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,200
So later lead to the family

878
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
Others contracted the disease and died

879
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,200
So everyone sounds like this, don't you think?

880
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,400
It seems to be a bit like combined bacteria, right?

881
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,400
There is also an entity

882
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,900
just called a prison bug

883
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,000
and spread in the family

884
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,000
so you take the word out

885
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,700
It seems to make others feel that

886
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
In fact, this disease in China is a family disease.

887
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
The Chinese Prison already knew

888
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,200
Words like this were even coined before

889
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,800
to describe this thing

890
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,700
And use this word to make everyone reinforce that

891
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,700
An image that feels like the disease is spreading in the family

892
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,900
But what?

893
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,400
if we think about it

894
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,000
Prison worms and combined infectious bacteria

895
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,400
Behavioral patterns between

896
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,400
It's actually very different

897
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,700
how to say

898
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,400
I didn't just tell you that

899
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,900
The worm in the handed down prison is born after death

900
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,440
just run away, right?

901
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,100
But we save fuel and get infected with bacteria when we are actually alive

902
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,900
passed on while alive

903
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,740
So according to Academician Liang Qizi and

904
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,100
Research by Mr. Li Jianmin of Shi Yisuo

905
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,940
The reason why the concept of the so-called master is the most popular

906
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,060
In fact, it is a Buddhist or Taoist concept.

907
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,340
It means that in a family

908
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,060
your father's eg your karma

909
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,300
Your karma will be transmitted equal to

910
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,440
Gekqua passed down to others in the family

911
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,000
It's actually kind of like an inheritance

912
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,080
Do you understand what I mean?

913
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,400
That is to say, you have a lot of karma

914
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,280
Maybe the merit you do and your karma

915
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,600
on your dad

916
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,800
Your dad's passing only this all goes to

917
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,300
on your next generation

918
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,600
Nao Chongzhi is just a part of it

919
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,500
In other words, the transmission process

920
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,440
In fact, it is related to the concept of religion.

921
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,000
not because you live together

922
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,140
but now

923
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,040
So from this point of view

924
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,940
Katsuragi Hui he re-established the family and disease

925
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,960
a relation through the word

926
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
He mentioned the life-saving

927
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,960
to highlight family members

928
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,960
The horrible situation of widespread labor sickness

929
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
But the concept of home

930
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,160
There has been a conversion

931
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,000
He highlights that it is indeed family

932
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,560
is a new one family concept

933
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,960
relationship with disease

934
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,960
It's not about the religious

935
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,360
A transmission of merit and karma

936
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,360
It's about family members being together

937
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Intimate interaction day and night

938
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
causing a disease to spread

939
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,360
So it's kind of like saving old and new from Pingzhuang

940
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:34,920
right

941
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
On the one hand, it makes you feel a sense of fear

942
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
On the other hand, I changed it to something

943
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,920
So what? The family has grown from a religious-ethical organization

944
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
become a physical cohabitation

945
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,920
But from these places you will see

946
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,920
That is to say, he advocated this life-saving

947
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,920
is key for highlighting, festival and dissemination

948
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,920
family in china

949
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,920
So and in fact in

950
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,920
After the concept became popular

951
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,480
let's see that

952
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,740
Just like now sometimes our teachers

953
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,740
Don't know what students write their experience?

954
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Nafang Primary School invites many students

955
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,240
to write articles

956
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,740
many students started

957
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,940
with a look of fear

958
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,240
looking at his parents and grandparents

959
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
and say i can feel

960
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,240
the way my grandfather ate or spit

961
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,940
and then how to pass it on to my grandmother

962
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,940
And later killed my brothers and sisters

963
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,740
I just feel an unprecedented

964
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,340
you by these

965
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,240
are you at home

966
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,080
This is your dearest person

967
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,440
but you feel

968
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,680
They passed the disease on to you

969
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,680
Then you can't protect yourself from a sense of fear

970
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,180
That was a very common feeling at that time

971
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:40,840
good

972
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,680
So from this point of view you see

973
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,180
it's really a very different

974
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,180
understanding of a disease

975
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,580
in China in the 1930s

976
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,080
People Don't Think Syndrome Is Industrialization

977
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,940
caused by urbanization

978
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,380
If so, it is a process of modernization

979
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,140
In fact in combination disease is understood as

980
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,140
We feel it when Social disease

981
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,760
would be considered a disease of civilization

982
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,260
disease caused by civilization

983
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
But at that time the Chinese believed that

984
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,760
Nor do they see the state as actively involved in

985
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,760
can solve this problem

986
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
So you won't learn Japanese like

987
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
I think the government needs to intervene

988
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,260
In fact, the government cannot

989
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
to solve this problem

990
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,760
what about the opposite

991
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,260
in Chinese understanding

992
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,260
this disease

993
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
including even public health officials

994
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,760
and all things think

995
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
The Culprit of Syndrome in China

996
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
in a traditional Chinese family

997
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
long-term unhygienic

998
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
a personal habit

999
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
So this is how to understand the disease

1000
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
becomes quite the opposite

1001
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
understood from the west

1002
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
This is caused by modernization

1003
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
understood in Chinese

1004
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Because you are too present in a traditional family

1005
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,760
you have this disease

1006
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,760
So although you are not industrialized

1007
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
but you get very sick with this

1008
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,760
That even some public health experts pointed out

1009
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,760
The ultimate solution to the combined disease in China

1010
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Know that it is a small family that fully adopts Europe and the United States

1011
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,760
Then this may be better than the dining table we just talked about

1012
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,760
more amazing

1013
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,700
That is to say, in order to solve a disease

1014
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,540
you have to change

1015
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,840
You want everyone's family system to change

1016
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,340
but you can feel it

1017
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,840
At that time, public health experts thought

1018
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,680
with their understanding of the disease

1019
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,840
How many reasons for its establishment are related to

1020
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,540
related to the family environment

1021
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,540
If we speak in more abstract language

1022
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,540
we can say

1023
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,540
This is called the pathologicalization of the traditional Chinese family

1024
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,700
as you think

1025
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,740
You imagine this home as the cause of all kinds of diseases

1026
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,240
Then there's the harm it brings to everyone

1027
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,080
So it should have been a

1028
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,280
All of your values, right?

1029
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,940
you get warm

1030
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,440
place of warmth and hugs

1031
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,080
You now feel like it's the source of all your problems

1032
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,640
is a like a cause

1033
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,980
Pathologicalization of a Traditional Family

1034
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,440
That's the point at that time

1035
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,940
A conclusion drawn on disease

1036
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,540
I'm talking here, do you have any questions?

1037
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,580
Ruiyou can first propose

1038
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
please

1039
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
This has something to do with the noble family, is it in the noble family?

1040
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Um

1041
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
that red chinchilla

1042
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
yes

1043
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
right

1044
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
For this noble family, it is a stump

1045
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
The topic of remnants

1046
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
right

1047
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Like I mentioned the adjacent generation domain just now?

1048
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
so you asked this question, right?

1049
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
What he meant was that

1050
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
From a certain point of view, the environment of this disease

1051
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
In fact, there is something in that culture

1052
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
one that would have encouraged people

1053
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
caused by the lifestyles that people are encouraged to adopt

1054
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Then what you just said he didn't talk about the remnants

1055
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
just say you don't like doing outdoor activities

1056
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
this is one of the important points

1057
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
For example, another point is to say

1058
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
He'll keep emphasizing like I just didn't say

1059
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
western opinion says

1060
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
The problem to be solved in anatomical diseases is the problem of lighting

1061
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
right

1062
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But relatively speaking

1063
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
China has always been afraid of the wind

1064
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,540
The doors and windows are tightly closed

1065
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,820
I don't want to go outside

1066
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,360
This is what was said more

1067
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,660
silkworm feet to no direct connection there

1068
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,160
Um

1069
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,220
in

1070
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,800
because it is

1071
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,080
Hakka is you

1072
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,640
they are you

1073
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,200
they are all dame of labor

1074
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,240
often done in agricultural products

1075
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,020
right

1076
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,520
yes

1077
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,560
then we

1078
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,860
Speaking of Song and Ming Dynasties

1079
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,620
right

1080
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,420
Three Canons of Lecturers

1081
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,180
right

1082
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,480
They are all Hakka dames

1083
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,260
yes

1084
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,300
are playing and teaching abroad

1085
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:34,820
yes

1086
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,340
When the Republic of China came out of the clouds

1087
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:36,860
yes

1088
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,160
they go all the way

1089
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,180
Lecture Committee

1090
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,460
dame outside a foreign country

1091
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:41,980
yes

1092
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,800
I will later

1093
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,580
He will appear in this story later

1094
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,860
you wait a moment

1095
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,640
right

1096
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,460
Then I just stopped here to tell you

1097
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,540
The stories I just told you are all about a public health expert.

1098
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,060
right

1099
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,620
And everyone can hear that it was actually the

1100
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,100
Working in China

1101
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Medical elites at home and abroad

1102
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
But they came to a very surprising conclusion

1103
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That is to say, this is a very serious problem.

1104
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
But Chen Yin is completely different from the West

1105
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
And this Chen Yin directly came from

1106
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
A condition of the family originating in China

1107
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
That's why I said that in the West it is regarded as a

1108
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
social disease

1109
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Treated as a family disease in China

1110
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
put it in the history of medicine

1111
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
is a very surprising thing

1112
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Because logically speaking, they have also received this training.

1113
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And everyone just saw the Lai Dou I cited

1114
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
His first sentence is

1115
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
In China, this problem should not only be an economic problem

1116
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Indicates that he knows that the world believes that

1117
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's a socioeconomic issue, right?

1118
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But we are such a one that puts all the problems

1119
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,000
It all belongs to China, this belongs to the family

1120
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Surprising words in medical treatment

1121
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
But if we put him in

1122
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Modern Chinese History in the 20th Century

1123
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
or modern history

1124
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I am the director of the modern history of the surrounding

1125
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
That is, if we break away from medical

1126
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,400
put him in the mainstream of modern history

1127
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,600
In fact it's common sense

1128
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,200
that's the one

1129
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,200
This is a book written by Susan Glasser

1130
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,200
It's called Transfusions of Family and State

1131
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,000
Let’s talk about how people in modern China regard this family

1132
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,200
Some visions and ideas of the country

1133
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,000
It is written in this book that at that time

1134
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,800
In fact, whether it is the Kuomintang or the Communist Party

1135
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,600
Or journalistic campaigners

1136
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,400
Everyone thinks the problem is with the family

1137
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Feeling that family is at the heart of the problem

1138
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,400
So what I just told you is that

1139
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,400
From the perspective of medical history, we

1140
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,400
It's surprising how you came to this conclusion

1141
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
But if you're out of medical history

1142
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
you go back to that big social environment

1143
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Everyone already felt the problem

1144
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
It's all about the family

1145
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,400
you know what i mean

1146
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Then I will give you the most drastic example

1147
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
The most intense is Fu Sinian

1148
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
His first issue in Xinchao

1149
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,400
You see, this is also the first issue

1150
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,200
1919

1151
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
publish an article

1152
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,500
called the root of all evil

1153
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,700
He said that China is the root of all evil

1154
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,000
is a Chinese family

1155
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
In fact, we rarely get this

1156
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,500
At that time it was

1157
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
very harsh criticism

1158
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,700
Then why did he say

1159
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,500
The Chinese family is the root of all evil in China

1160
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,000
He said that because Chinese families are

1161
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
The biggest force that destroys personality

1162
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,500
what does that mean he said

1163
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,000
from the day the child was born

1164
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,500
teach him how to be tough

1165
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,000
how to deny yourself

1166
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,700
how to be your father and mother's son

1167
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,200
never teach him to do

1168
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,700
his being himself

1169
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,200
so it's a lot like your kid

1170
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,200
not one of your children

1171
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,200
The version from a hundred years ago, right?

1172
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,200
He just said don't teach him to catch himself

1173
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,200
In a word it is

1174
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
extreme destruction of personality

1175
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,700
So he felt that the root of all evil

1176
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,700
It means that after you destroy a person's personality

1177
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,700
All the above questions come from here

1178
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,200
because the person has lost autonomy

1179
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,200
with his individuality

1180
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,200
what about in this article

1181
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
He thinks the key is family

1182
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,200
destroy personality

1183
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
But what?

1184
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
In this article, his personalities are put in quotation marks more than a dozen times

1185
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
So he knows full well the word is new

1186
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
At that time, people didn't know what personality was

1187
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
because why

1188
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Because including individuals and individuals are actually new words just created

1189
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
It's from Japanese, it's the translation

1190
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
individual and individualism have just been introduced

1191
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So from this point of view

1192
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
That Fussian critique of the Chinese family

1193
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
from a libertarian individualistic standpoint

1194
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Absolutely in this original home setting

1195
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Don't let children decide what industry they want to go

1196
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
If you don't let him get married, you have to listen to the family's orders.

1197
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
so that he loses one of his autonomy as an individual

1198
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
let him call it a personality

1199
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So that's a source of his critique

1200
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That's called the root of all evil

1201
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
There are many criticisms in that book from this angle.

1202
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Even Hu Shi, the dean of the month

1203
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
He said that China used to feel the most unfilial

1204
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,760
That means you are not filial to your grandfather, right?

1205
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,160
unfilial offspring

1206
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,600
He said that even if you are not filial, you will make progress

1207
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,560
From the perspective of evolution, there is no way to progress without mutation

1208
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,200
So it's good for everyone to be unfilial

1209
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,960
it was one of those days

1210
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,400
such a critical position

1211
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,400
So let's look at it from this point of view

1212
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,960
Actually we have a puzzle

1213
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,160
That's why two sports that look so different

1214
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,960
It seems like we have a date

1215
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,160
It's the science-based Fei Jiehe's prevention and control campaign

1216
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,120
I use the picture of Katsuragi Club as a representative

1217
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,360
make it easier for everyone to remember

1218
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,360
and this individualistic

1219
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,080
Seems like a home improvement movement based on an ideology

1220
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,520
They seem to have made an appointment, right?

1221
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,280
They all think the problem is the same regardless

1222
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,320
Seeing the Chinese family as the root of the problem

1223
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:53,360
serious personal harm

1224
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,360
On Katsuragi's side, right?

1225
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:00,360
It's the family that passed the disease on to this young man.

1226
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
a student an individual

1227
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I just said that many young students feel

1228
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
They saw their body's being grandpa

1229
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
a threat from a grandfather or father

1230
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
what about here

1231
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
In the year of Fuji, it is also said that they were all killed by their parents.

1232
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
destroy your personality

1233
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Why is this one derived from the scientific

1234
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
with a value derived from society

1235
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It seems that two people are walking together

1236
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
right

1237
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
as if supporting each other

1238
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Is this a coincidence

1239
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
if it is not a coincidence

1240
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
What is the mechanism behind the difference?

1241
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I'm talking about do you have any friends here?

1242
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
any ideas

1243
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Because it looks really close, right?

1244
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
is that a coincidence

1245
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
you want to say please say

1246
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
please i want to ask

1247
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And about the house behind it is

1248
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I mean after World War II

1249
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
or card interface

1250
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That is, the Allied Forces keep pushing

1251
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Whether it is Japan or

1252
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Dongdong has already

1253
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,800
Because of BCG to treat

1254
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,120
In the case of National Taiwan University Hospital

1255
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,140
he will go to therapy

1256
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,260
They had a lot of medical students at the time

1257
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,760
Including treatment with convalescence

1258
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,540
BCG

1259
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,340
and treatment with Feijie and toxin

1260
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:19,200
But they all belong to the family structure of Confucian society

1261
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,240
As a result we can learn one thing

1262
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,040
That is to say, local Chinese

1263
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,600
Although they bring the problem home

1264
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,140
But Fei Jie and the problem is still serious

1265
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,700
Based on the medical data in Taiwan at that time

1266
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,760
Hygienic habits in Taiwan at that time

1267
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,060
running water etc

1268
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,620
Popular in several provinces of leading China

1269
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,160
even at the level of an itch

1270
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,200
But he Feige and the problem is still serious

1271
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,480
so i personally think

1272
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,780
you take your problems home

1273
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,340
Or use it as Confucianism

1274
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,900
or problematic points in feudal thought

1275
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,940
I think a little bit at the time

1276
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,000
Hua Po fallacy

1277
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,500
What

1278
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,540
a Huapo fallacy

1279
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,320
that is to say a

1280
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,100
how to explain

1281
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,860
is a fallacy

1282
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,400
everyone is one of a kind

1283
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,160
everyone thinks

1284
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,600
It's the whole problem. All problems boil down to this

1285
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,860
Even if everyone has no money today

1286
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,000
Or everyone has no culture

1287
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,500
It's all because of family

1288
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,160
So I think it's a time

1289
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,160
No matter what the New Culture Movement says

1290
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,660
At that time, everyone had a trend

1291
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,160
so is it a coincidence

1292
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,300
I think it was some intellectuals at that time

1293
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,700
Some people like Cai Peihuo sum it up as

1294
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,660
Inductive result

1295
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,960
But as for the cost, it was finally because of BCG

1296
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,160
fully treated

1297
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,500
so i feel like saying

1298
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,460
If it can be classified as a family problem

1299
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,460
I think it's still a little biased

1300
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,160
But I don't know what professor you think

1301
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,260
about this one thing

1302
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,660
Yes, first you gave a very important background

1303
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,460
That’s what we just said, only the germ theory, right?

1304
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,100
But there is no cure

1305
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,660
As far as the time I am talking about is

1306
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,960
there is no cure at all

1307
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,860
just like you said

1308
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,560
So back then it was actually just a nursing home

1309
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,660
that is no effective therapy

1310
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,360
So this question is another very important background

1311
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,700
in this story

1312
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,660
Then another big difference

1313
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,060
actually

1314
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,460
I just had no chance to speak

1315
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:04,200
That is to say, in the context of Japan just now

1316
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,600
Have treated it as a Social Disease

1317
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,300
right

1318
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,500
like i said

1319
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,100
So that later the Japanese royal family began

1320
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,200
is to provide a large fund

1321
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,900
To solve the problem of Japanese workers

1322
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,000
This puzzling and problematic thing for workers

1323
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,800
would feel like saying

1324
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,900
you improve its nutrition

1325
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,200
improve its living environment

1326
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,700
might help it

1327
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,900
You treat it like a Social Disease

1328
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,900
to deal with

1329
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,100
Well, today this is in the context of China

1330
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,000
I just because of that time

1331
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,500
What I didn't say carefully is

1332
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,400
Actually at that time

1333
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,900
The one who was taken by Xiehe Hospital

1334
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,200
a very important leader

1335
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,900
His name is John Grant

1336
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,300
is listed as one of the John Hopkins

1337
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,400
public health hero

1338
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,200
he just said

1339
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,100
Let's not prioritize combination disease

1340
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,800
Because if he's Social Disease

1341
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,600
It just requires the government to invest a lot of money

1342
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,300
to improve the financial environment

1343
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,900
if that doesn't work

1344
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:55,900
So in fact our story

1345
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,600
how much is in that environment

1346
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,200
you think you can't help

1347
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,200
if you think about it

1348
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,300
into a social disease

1349
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,000
everyone helpless

1350
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,100
Then if you emphasize it as a

1351
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,000
unhygienic habits

1352
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,100
words that cause disease

1353
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,000
at least we can do something

1354
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,700
So it's kind of in this vein

1355
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,800
what happened

1356
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,100
So you said that is not to say

1357
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,400
slightly incorrect

1358
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,700
This story is now undeniably incorrect

1359
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,700
So from what we say today

1360
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,800
Fei Jie and Qi is a respiratory disease

1361
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,400
right

1362
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,100
not at all through this

1363
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,500
That is to say, the situation of droplet infection

1364
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,400
So the concept is

1365
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,900
From today's point of view

1366
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,300
scientifically incorrect

1367
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,400
but people at that time

1368
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,200
It is the leading scientist we are talking about

1369
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,300
Like the Wuliande I just mentioned

1370
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,800
he always believed it

1371
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,600
so he

1372
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,700
He's even a nominee over there

1373
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,200
he will think

1374
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,300
this

1375
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,300
We're going to treat it like a disease like this

1376
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,900
So from the people at that time

1377
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,400
they will think

1378
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,200
Actually this is the question I just asked

1379
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,100
At that time, people may think that

1380
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,100
Scientists at the time

1381
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:55,900
they may feel

1382
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,600
It's the best they can have

1383
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,100
and has the most evidence

1384
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,160
The display should face this direction

1385
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,960
But the problem is that this is at the same time

1386
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,260
In fact, it is also related to a large social and cultural environment

1387
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,560
closely related

1388
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,560
Are they under his influence?

1389
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,300
it's a question I posed

1390
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,860
I think what you just said was that

1391
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,760
maybe there is no way to say

1392
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:17,260
that's how you feel, don't you

1393
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,360
Do you have any other friends or want to say something here?

1394
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:29,960
there is a gentleman over here please

1395
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,960
right

1396
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,060
my personal opinion

1397
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,560
when China was in the present

1398
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,360
Sanitary conditions will be inconvenient

1399
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,760
yes also bad

1400
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,960
Yes, for example, a child poops on the bed

1401
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,360
how to clean

1402
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,560
elder

1403
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,360
This dying old man or something

1404
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,260
sick old man

1405
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,860
What to do with the back row

1406
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,860
I thought it was time to go far

1407
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,420
Right, the doorman outside Sijakun

1408
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,340
yes there is such a situation

1409
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,360
Is it a matter of Ovarian?

1410
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,440
Infected and mixed

1411
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,240
For example, we are in Minbei

1412
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,240
there is a play called what

1413
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,700
Such a large communal situation

1414
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,340
So to make this contagion update the expansion

1415
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,500
Yes, as for not controlling me

1416
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,880
yes thank you

1417
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,740
just him

1418
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,720
That's exactly what people at the time imagined.

1419
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,820
I think it's a

1420
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,020
many people live together

1421
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,360
And we live together very closely

1422
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,680
mix everything together

1423
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,620
caused by

1424
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,820
At that time, such a situation was also described

1425
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,160
ok then i am speaking

1426
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,020
just if it's not a coincidence

1427
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,220
What might be the mechanism behind the difference

1428
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:48,120
I will give you a report

1429
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,060
In fact, a possible mechanism behind it is that

1430
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:54,120
in the west

1431
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,620
Three important health systems

1432
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,780
In fact, it simultaneously creates three

1433
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,020
a different identity

1434
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,400
How should I put it? Let me talk about the first example.

1435
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,900
The first example is quarantine

1436
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,900
Everyone knows today, right?

1437
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,400
It reinforces a sovereign state

1438
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,900
Identity within a sovereign state

1439
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,400
because the threat we feel at this time

1440
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,400
It's all from the outside, right?

1441
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,200
from the port from outside

1442
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,800
So you in order to prevent this disease

1443
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,800
Just like the FAKE we talked about before

1444
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,400
In fact, Quarantine is related to the Black Death, right?

1445
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,200
So you will put Jiang Jie in your country

1446
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,600
Fortify it, don't let outsiders in

1447
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,200
that in doing so

1448
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,200
In fact, you have to have the sovereignty of a sovereign country

1449
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,800
you control the port

1450
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,800
But doing it will also let the people inside

1451
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,400
stronger feeling says

1452
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,300
The threat is from outside

1453
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,600
In fact, many times in the 19th century

1454
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,700
Everyone names the disease

1455
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,400
are named after another country.

1456
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,800
That is to say, the American drug is from another country.

1457
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,500
right

1458
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,700
So this health system of this quarantine

1459
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,400
Its boundaries are equivalent to surrounding a

1460
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,000
space on the map

1461
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,800
and make you inside

1462
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,700
it requires you to be a sovereign state

1463
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:59,500
To be able to implement such a health system

1464
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,300
while executing

1465
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,560
In the process of implementation, it will be further strengthened

1466
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,640
The people inside feel that we are a community of life

1467
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,900
Then we have common interests

1468
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,740
Then isolate yourself from outside threats.

1469
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,960
That's why something like

1470
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,320
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many people will say

1471
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,380
Don't we claim to be entering a globalized world?

1472
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,920
Why all of a sudden

1473
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,200
The gates are closed

1474
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:19,960
right

1475
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,520
In fact, at the beginning, no one wanted to close the door.

1476
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,360
Because in fact, this method was rarely used by the nineteenth century.

1477
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,900
because the adoption will lead to

1478
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,200
disruption of international trade

1479
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,480
interruption of communication

1480
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,820
But when the disease comes, you will be forced to take this approach

1481
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,380
So in fact, COVID-19 is forcing us to adopt a

1482
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,920
It hasn't been done for a long time

1483
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,460
but at the same time it will

1484
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,540
Let you feel a strong anti-globalization force

1485
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,580
consolidated a sovereign state

1486
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,620
self-identity

1487
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,660
I think that's what we've all experienced

1488
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,700
a very large force

1489
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,040
And the second one is health science in the nineteenth century

1490
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,060
A boundary it reinforces is an anatomical body

1491
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,600
how to say everyone has heard

1492
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,300
Chinese public health

1493
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,200
It's John Snow, right?

1494
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,800
He found a water

1495
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,500
a water supply place

1496
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,300
spreads mischief

1497
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,900
So only World Health Sciences

1498
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,800
One of his concerns

1499
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,900
is my body

1500
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,100
relationship to my environment

1501
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,300
anything can get in my body

1502
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,300
It's probably a cure, right?

1503
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,500
such as water

1504
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,300
Or the air I breathe, etc.

1505
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:24,900
that is

1506
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
you will be very concerned about me this

1507
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:27,800
so-called anatomy students

1508
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,100
it's my body

1509
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,900
around my whole skin

1510
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,500
I will pay attention to all the holes

1511
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,900
Because that's where the disease comes in

1512
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,500
Then other diseases also come out from the hole

1513
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,700
So for example our pee and poop

1514
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,600
suddenly became a big problem

1515
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,800
It is Semitic Science

1516
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,600
Just to build a sewer

1517
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,200
Because those things may make the disease

1518
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,600
bring to others

1519
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,300
So there is even a

1520
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,900
our pores

1521
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,700
and suddenly we have for our

1522
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,400
The sweat becomes a great concern, too

1523
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,500
So the result of the development of this science

1524
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,400
makes us pay unprecedented attention to

1525
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,400
Our relationship with the environment

1526
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,400
And pay attention to monitor

1527
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
The mouth of our body

1528
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,800
And that is to say

1529
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,000
genitals, wait

1530
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,400
There are pores and so on

1531
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,400
So strengthened an anatomical body

1532
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
the other one is

1533
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,000
When does the boundary between our body and the environment

1534
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,600
It's dangerous if you don't know

1535
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,400
because you have to protect the border

1536
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,200
what is one of those dangerous times

1537
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,600
that's when I'm going back to the environment

1538
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,200
when i die

1539
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,400
So at that time, we will pay great attention to disposing of the dead body.

1540
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,000
right

1541
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
dead bodies suddenly become a big problem

1542
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Then start the one around

1543
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,400
The cemetery that was originally built in the city center

1544
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,000
All will be transferred to foreign affairs

1545
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,200
It's like saying our excrement is suddenly down the drain

1546
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,000
So the rise of this science

1547
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,800
will strengthen our one is to say

1548
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,600
you feel this in your body

1549
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,800
Note that a skin surrounds all the holes

1550
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,500
Then this is the health science of Xiyou Century

1551
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,200
Then to personal hygiene in the first half of the second century

1552
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,700
His focus is not on our relationship to our environment

1553
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,100
but the exchange of substances between the bodies

1554
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,800
like we just saw this picture right?

1555
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,000
Is the focus today on my relationship with the environment?

1556
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,400
Rather, from certain fluids in another person's body

1557
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,500
run to my problem

1558
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,200
Kissing, for example, suddenly became a very dangerous act.

1559
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,600
In fact, at that time there was a Poster talking about

1560
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,800
Kissing can be dangerous

1561
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,900
Then from this point of view, it means

1562
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,500
Our hygiene keeps reminding you that

1563
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,200
you have to be very careful

1564
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,000
When you exchange physical property with others

1565
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,700
Whether we drink from the same cup, right?

1566
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,000
or eat

1567
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,100
Or what kind of physical exchange

1568
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,600
It's an STD, right?

1569
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,800
when you find out about sex

1570
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,400
You will also have a physical exchange

1571
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,800
What about the rise of hygiene?

1572
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,600
would make us very aware

1573
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,600
material exchange between bodies

1574
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
There is also the social distance between people and the world

1575
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,500
So this strengthens a concern between us and the human world

1576
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,500
All of a sudden we're going to pay a lot of attention to this

1577
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,000
So from this point of view

1578
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,500
The story we just told today

1579
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,500
In fact, it is related to the personal hygiene in the middle of the night

1580
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,500
And what happened is closely related

1581
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Then I give these three examples to say

1582
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,500
I just said these two things

1583
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:27,000
What I just said is what I said earlier

1584
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Vice Miss' thoughts and Ge Chenghui's thoughts

1585
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,500
why close

1586
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:34,000
It is because in fact, when the three health systems are in operation

1587
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,500
It will invisibly strengthen certain identities

1588
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,000
So its original concern

1589
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:43,500
it's about who we are

1590
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,500
so will be combined

1591
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,000
Then we go further with this

1592
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,500
It can also be implemented when you are in epidemic prevention

1593
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,500
Remotely used or unused utensils

1594
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
For example, didn't you just talk about that

1595
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Isn't it very critical to take number two, right?

1596
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,000
anti-intermediate angle

1597
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,600
Anti-period is a pretty good thing that saves energy

1598
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,900
Because it is combined with the creation

1599
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:07,700
Then everyone crowded on the resistance

1600
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:10,800
It is also the most efficient use of limited energy

1601
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,400
Just heat it up there after you finish cooking so that everyone can live

1602
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,800
But at this moment, he suddenly became an evil head of state.

1603
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,000
That is to say, it can spread the disease

1604
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,800
Yes, just to the left is spreading the disease.

1605
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:22,800
everyone together

1606
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,800
But on the other hand

1607
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,800
It's not good to look at it from the perspective of four years.

1608
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,400
which means to say

1609
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,000
you have no privacy in this home

1610
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:32,700
right

1611
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,400
Every moment of your every second is seen by others

1612
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,800
you can't develop your personality

1613
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,700
because you don't have a separate space

1614
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,500
So this resistance is equivalent to changing

1615
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,400
suddenly became a symbol

1616
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,300
It both infects germs and kills personalities

1617
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,900
Especially at home plus this room

1618
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,000
I like to close the windows

1619
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,900
It even said that it seems that your home is closed.

1620
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,100
and you little kid in there

1621
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,100
The one who was murdered developed this personality

1622
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
easy to get sick

1623
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It is the pursuit of hygiene and the pursuit of individuality

1624
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
both are suppressed

1625
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
In addition, I showed you one

1626
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
personal hygiene cup

1627
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
This is the health experiment station of Peking Union Medical College Hospital

1628
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
A photo from 1935

1629
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
That means

1630
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
from now on is to say

1631
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
we just didn't talk

1632
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Don't experience the exchange, right?

1633
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
so start

1634
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Everyone Has Everyone's Own Cup

1635
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
even numbered

1636
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So when you want to use

1637
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
you use your own cup

1638
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
that in fact even in

1639
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It is also mentioned in the textbook

1640
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I use my own

1641
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
my own teacup

1642
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Then your method is

1643
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
In this way you are reinforcing

1644
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You feel

1645
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
you have to realize

1646
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
your contact with others

1647
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
actually very dangerous

1648
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
so you gotta have your own teacup

1649
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Then while you're using your own teacup

1650
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
Actually you too

1651
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Invisibly educating you

1652
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It's because you don't like to use it with others

1653
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,000
when you use it with others

1654
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
even nauseated

1655
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
you guys need to know what i mean

1656
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,800
From this point of view

1657
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,200
One he can both defend personal hygiene

1658
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,600
It also strengthens a sense of individualism and a body

1659
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,300
It's just that you don't like sharing things with others.

1660
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,700
What about Feijie and Hygiene Habits?

1661
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,500
Just like individualism is a kind of self-identity

1662
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,500
equal to the mutual support of the two

1663
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,100
So we usually talk about individualism

1664
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,700
is a value

1665
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,100
Or a way to protect your personal

1666
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,500
law of power

1667
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,900
But in fact, it is also implemented in a body

1668
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:31,500
you are like this

1669
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,700
such a bodily sensation

1670
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,100
you have to use your own teacup

1671
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:39,300
A condition that you don't want to mix with other people

1672
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:39,900
good

1673
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,400
So to say you see we can see now is to say

1674
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,100
I just said why these two colluded

1675
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,100
Why all the Chinese families

1676
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,700
authority as a problem

1677
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,700
serious personal harm

1678
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,000
that on these two utensils

1679
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,700
Their position is the same

1680
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,200
Both sides criticized the

1681
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,600
Then the use of personal hygiene cups will be encouraged, right?

1682
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,200
so that's it

1683
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,240
Those two are walking together again

1684
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,840
the worst the worst

1685
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,240
Reasons for Defejah's Problems

1686
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:11,640
In fact, it is a unique consensus system in China

1687
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,340
when you eat

1688
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,440
Everyone confuses those chopsticks with whore roots

1689
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,200
into the same soup, right?

1690
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,640
It's like saying you're exchanging this

1691
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,200
while you exchange saliva

1692
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,900
pass germs to each other

1693
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,600
That's what they thought the disease was

1694
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,500
the reason why it's so serious

1695
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,200
so this is the biggest challenge

1696
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,040
Then there is no way to solve a major problem

1697
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,400
that is also at this time

1698
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,400
So Wu Liande is the one

1699
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,200
asked to come

1700
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,740
That is to say, to solve this problem

1701
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,900
Then the problem was

1702
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,500
How serious did people think it was?

1703
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,340
You see, it's Kei Katsuragi who said again

1704
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:50,440
That is to say, facing this situation, he said

1705
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,640
He said that when you go to another house

1706
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,640
when still adopting the Chinese way of eating

1707
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,140
There's only one way you can defend yourself

1708
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,140
it's you sneaking first

1709
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Hurry up and take out a scoop of each dish

1710
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Then you don't eat it until someone else eats it

1711
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
That's a policy of self-defense of last resort.

1712
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
If you deal with it properly, you can only be a little faster than others

1713
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
others may not see

1714
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It was you who secretly ate first

1715
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
so you can feel in this

1716
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
as far as he is concerned

1717
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
how much he believes

1718
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
The disease brought about by this consensus

1719
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
is he would mind such a solution

1720
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
that this

1721
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
yes you can watch

1722
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You can see where he is absolutely in danger.

1723
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
good

1724
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
then in this case

1725
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
equal to why we just said

1726
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Wuliande will come to create this

1727
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It is because he is facing such a predicament

1728
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
that is

1729
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
every day when everyone is eating

1730
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
equal to one of the most important

1731
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Ways and channels of infection

1732
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
right

1733
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
how to solve this

1734
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
So he came up with three possibilities

1735
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
What about the first possibility?

1736
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
take-out tense

1737
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
just like westerners

1738
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
then you are going

1739
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,400
like a personal hygiene cup, right?

1740
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:04,700
Divide the dishes first, everyone eats everyone's

1741
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,500
so we don't exchange

1742
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:11,400
Exchanging that drool won't spread the germs either.

1743
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,900
what did he say

1744
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,200
He doesn't think it's a good way to eat Chinese food

1745
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,500
He is Malaysian Chinese

1746
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,100
that is so you see

1747
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,800
he makes the decision now

1748
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,300
On the one hand, it is a matter of hygiene

1749
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,300
On the one hand, it will have a profound impact on

1750
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,100
the way we eat in the future, right?

1751
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,300
It even means that the relationship between us and others

1752
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,900
He said it's not a good way

1753
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,100
but he didn't make it clear

1754
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,900
Why does he think it's not a good way

1755
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,100
Instead, I was in a 1950

1756
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,100
The doctor in Taiwan wrote that

1757
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,900
Why does he think this is not a good way

1758
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,700
He said you have to eat whole fish because of Chinese food

1759
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,600
whole chicken whole duck

1760
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,500
It's like dividing the rotten mess on everyone's plate

1761
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,700
not good

1762
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,600
So he thinks it's not a good way

1763
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,400
so this is actually quite interesting

1764
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,900
I quite agree with him

1765
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,300
It's a good thing we didn't adopt this food sharing system

1766
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:04,300
For more than five years, I said that this is not a good way.

1767
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:07,800
What about the second one? He strengthened it.

1768
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,200
Everyone should have two pairs of chopsticks

1769
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,000
So you just have a pair of chopsticks

1770
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
For example, you say that I am catching that fish now.

1771
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
You pick up that fish with a chopstick

1772
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,500
put it in

1773
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,000
You change another chopstick

1774
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,500
come in your mouth

1775
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,000
Then he said another pair of chopsticks

1776
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
you should use red

1777
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,800
That's like a reminder that it's dangerous

1778
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,500
just use it on yourself

1779
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,500
But he said it's not a good way

1780
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,500
In fact, it is said that I was the one just now

1781
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,000
The guest mentioned Song Meiling

1782
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,500
It is said that Song Meiling's family used these two pairs of chopsticks

1783
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,000
It's not a good way to say it in five years

1784
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,500
Because of his own trial results

1785
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,000
I found it very easy to get confused

1786
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,500
It's the slowness, you can't figure it out

1787
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,000
Which pair is which pair of chopsticks

1788
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That is in this context

1789
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
He finally said he designed this

1790
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Hydrogenic Chinese Dining Table

1791
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,500
invent this

1792
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,000
In fact, this is to cooperate with the male and female pools

1793
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,760
It has a detailed description of how the plate is to be made

1794
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,760
so it really thinks it invented it

1795
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,260
Then the key point is that it should be combined with the male block and the female pool

1796
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:11,560
So what is the purpose of this plate?

1797
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,040
because if you don't have this plate

1798
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,560
For dishes farther away, you can’t get the male and female pools, right?

1799
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,060
If you have this plate, you can put it

1800
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:21,660
Turn in front of you and follow the male and female pool

1801
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,960
you can use

1802
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,860
So in a situation like this

1803
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,760
it thinks it designed this

1804
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,660
Solved a hygiene problem

1805
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,820
And at the same time it can

1806
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,820
Solved the problem of sanitation

1807
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:35,920
But it's not fully remodeled

1808
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,820
innate way of eating

1809
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,920
the relationship between me and a person

1810
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,120
So it's very proud to think it's a

1811
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,020
combined with a traditional way of dining

1812
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:49,220
and an indigenous innovation of modern hygiene principles

1813
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,320
so in other words

1814
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,720
Even when you face this hygiene challenge

1815
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:55,820
You can still create a way

1816
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:59,780
To protect some original social relations

1817
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,960
you eat full chinese food

1818
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,040
Then it means that everyone hangs out and eats together.

1819
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,340
In fact, we put this matter

1820
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:10,400
The cultural history of 1924 is actually a

1821
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,680
You may feel small now

1822
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,880
But it was a big deal at the time

1823
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,480
Because it affects people's social relations

1824
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,480
For example, let me show you a picture

1825
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,480
This picture is a round table in Japan on Tatami

1826
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,180
right

1827
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,000
you may want to

1828
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,680
It's also a modern invention

1829
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,200
When the Japanese eat at the table

1830
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,800
each eats his own

1831
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,640
Then came the introduction of Western civilization

1832
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,080
they get a concept

1833
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,980
That is to say the definition of a Happy Family

1834
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:36,440
Just want everyone to eat together

1835
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,280
no such words

1836
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,640
no real family feeling

1837
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,780
That's why I invented this table

1838
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:44,440
So the story I just told is that

1839
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,440
Actually our

1840
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,640
Various difficulties encountered in order to prevent the epidemic

1841
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,140
Artifacts created by concepts

1842
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,140
and that bodily sensation

1843
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,040
have profoundly affected us

1844
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,140
that's a

1845
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,240
So we may often

1846
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,040
didn't realize

1847
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But as long as we think about today, if we

1848
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
no longer eating on that plate

1849
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But if everyone gets a share

1850
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Our lives may really have changed a lot

1851
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
That's what I'm going to report to you today.

1852
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
thank you all

1853
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Thank you so much Mr. Ray

1854
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
give a very good speech

1855
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I believe that everyone has gained as much as I have.

1856
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
then we were

1857
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,000
The top ten guests who asked questions

1858
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
we have prepared a beautiful little gift

1859
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
That's because a few friends have already asked questions

1860
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Then we are open Q&A now

1861
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And as long as it's the top ten

1862
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
We have this in our homestay

1863
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Speaking of we are two or three questions your answer

1864
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It's all good, okay, okay

1865
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Okay two or three

1866
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
good good good

1867
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Like this, please answer again

1868
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Are we the first

1869
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
In the first round we collect two or three questions

1870
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:07,440
Professor Lei, have you ever visited South Korea

1871
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,640
Then the Koreans eat

1872
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,040
How are their habits different from those of the Chinese?

1873
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,200
Or is it different from how Taiwanese eat?

1874
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,840
Recently, the epidemic in South Korea has been soaring

1875
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,280
terrible

1876
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,520
Thanks

1877
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,680
ok thanks for coming

1878
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,800
Hello Professor Lei

1879
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,800
I find it very interesting the way you use that inference

1880
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:43,000
Then discuss which family becomes a most bonded one

1881
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:50,400
Then there is a conclusion that the transformation of the traditional Chinese family is a process before pathology

1882
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,400
If we take an inference like yours

1883
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,320
And compared to what the West is talking about

1884
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,620
Abandoned festivals are a disease of civilization caused by modernization

1885
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,760
So is it under such a history in the West?

1886
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:16,000
There is also such a thing as industrialization and urbanization

1887
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,240
The condition of a phenomenal society that also pathologizes it

1888
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,240
or there is such a discourse produced

1889
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,000
because what we see seems to be an opposite result

1890
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
It is they who want to promote the economy instead

1891
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Then caused a second wave of accelerated industrialization

1892
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
yes

1893
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Thanks

1894
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
that there was no socialist country

1895
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So rise up at that time

1896
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
yes

1897
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Thanks

1898
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
ok maybe one more question

1899
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Let's ask Lei Shao to answer together

1900
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
come please

1901
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
It is because of this economic factor that the dissemination of scrap joints

1902
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Is it possible that

1903
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,800
The Great Depression of 1929

1904
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,300
And that leads to saying that people start to have this kind of thinking

1905
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,200
However, it was discovered that China

1906
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,000
was not affected by the events of 1929

1907
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,800
think about family

1908
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,000
To infer that China's puzzling box came from the family

1909
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
rather than economically

1910
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,500
thanks for your questions

1911
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,800
In terms of this last question

1912
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,000
In fact, it is considered to be a social problem.

1913
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,400
You see what I mentioned in the title of the book just now

1914
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,300
19th century France

1915
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,500
It actually happened at the end of the 19th century

1916
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:42,300
So in fact, everyone knows that at the end of the 19th century

1917
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:44,000
a lot of socialist ideas

1918
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,700
It's all started, right?

1919
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,100
I think it's social structure

1920
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,500
In fact, it is very harmful to human health

1921
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,100
So in fact, it should not need to go to 1929

1922
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,200
The Great Depression Happened

1923
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,900
Already happened at the end of the 19th century

1924
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,600
Probably such a situation

1925
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,660
The question you asked just now is a very good question

1926
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,660
Indeed

1927
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:04,500
that is

1928
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,460
So what we mean by civilization disease is actually very contradictory.

1929
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,500
Because civilization is inherently good, right?

1930
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,800
But I feel that civilization may bring disease

1931
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,960
So in fact, from this point of view, it means

1932
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,860
As we just said, for example

1933
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:20,660
The establishment of the 8-hour working hour system per day, etc.

1934
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:21,460
equal to this question

1935
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,860
The problems brought about by the civilization of media

1936
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,800
Indeed some people regard it as a

1937
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,300
just this article

1938
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,560
as a text

1939
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,560
critique of civilization

1940
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,660
you are right

1941
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,320
Another well-known response to the so-called disease of civilization is

1942
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,560
neurasthenia

1943
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,160
Of course, these were probably the two most famous diseases at the time.

1944
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,320
that is to say, people would think

1945
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,120
Actually you should be able to trace back to our civilization

1946
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,820
brought about by a negative place

1947
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,220
so you are right

1948
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,120
Then you just talked about a situation in South Korea

1949
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,620
Actually, I dare not say that I understand so well

1950
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,460
the state of their meals

1951
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:53,420
Then

1952
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,080
You start by telling me that I can't remember

1953
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,420
I can only

1954
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I probably remember my first time

1955
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I just got this research result

1956
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
When sharing with a Korean medical historian

1957
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
He said why the Koreans didn't invent this thing

1958
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So he probably felt there was some kind of relationship

1959
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
But I don't know that much about Korea

1960
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
to answer this question

1961
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Excuse me

1962
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I would like to ask this is the part about this study

1963
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Is there any data found later?

1964
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Said that after using this stall

1965
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Some reduction related data of FJH

1966
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Are there statistics?

1967
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
or is this a

1968
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
One of our conclusions from the previous

1969
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
A food that can still be seen

1970
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
But maybe when collecting data

1971
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
not that much research

1972
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I don't believe there is such a Fei Jiehe

1973
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
This data actually reduces

1974
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Is there this connection

1975
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Okay, thank you

1976
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
any left

1977
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
come here sir

1978
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Huang Peiren

1979
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Huang Peiren ask the teacher for advice

1980
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
that now a group meal

1981
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Fuji-Canada Group

1982
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Everyone said big dinner

1983
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
it's a big meal

1984
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
it's a buffet style

1985
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
such a

1986
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
wrong work

1987
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Will it change later

1988
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
this whole one

1989
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
one of the dining habits

1990
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Way

1991
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
even brought home

1992
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I bring it home like this

1993
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Thanks

1994
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
any left

1995
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
we can three questions

1996
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Then please this

1997
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Director Lei, Mr. Lei

1998
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Listen to our answer Line

1999
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I'm Hou

2000
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:00,920
idea is to say

2001
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,480
During the teacher's speech just now, you can see

2002
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:06,280
That is to say, the relationship between people and diseases is from

2003
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,600
national power

2004
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,800
start to get deeper into the individual

2005
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,040
and remove people from the family

2006
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,760
Freed from traditional family

2007
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,200
and then controlled by state power

2008
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:19,320
Did he also affect the later 49 years later

2009
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,360
Chinese Communist Party in

2010
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,520
Some views on medical care in this process in China

2011
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,800
How will it change that's my first question

2012
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,320
The second question I look at from the context of European history

2013
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,120
words mean

2014
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,760
From the cross tank written by that country autumn in the past

2015
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,200
to the one written by fukuguchi

2016
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,680
The history of madness books have about the so-called wind power guys

2017
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,720
like being locked in bed

2018
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,800
Plus it's like

2019
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,680
Thomas Mann in his

2020
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,360
Zauberberg's novel also describes

2021
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,960
Fei Jiehe's patients

2022
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,960
They are usually a rich bourgeois

2023
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,040
locked in a

2024
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,880
A very luxurious mountain on a Swiss mountain

2025
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,760
such a process

2026
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,920
Then I don't know what the teacher thinks about it

2027
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,240
Such a change or how to be honest about such a phenomenon

2028
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:03,680
Thanks

2029
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:04,440
Yes Yes

2030
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,480
that

2031
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,800
Thank you for your question

2032
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,360
First

2033
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,800
the first question you asked me

2034
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,520
to be honest

2035
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,840
i didn't see

2036
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,560
I don't see relevant research statistics

2037
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,480
And in fact Mandroid

2038
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:17,440
in this story

2039
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,240
In fact, this should follow

2040
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,000
The male and female pool

2041
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:21,840
right

2042
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,160
But I actually don't know the male pool and the female pool

2043
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,640
How popular was it at the time

2044
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,880
and frankly

2045
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:28,840
I

2046
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,040
The first picture I just showed you

2047
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,600
In fact, in 1965 in that China Town in the United States

2048
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:35,680
that is

2049
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,560
now likely

2050
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,840
Five years did invent the dinner plate in 1915

2051
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,080
but it didn't really catch on

2052
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,960
when it became popular

2053
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,200
In fact it is the result of restaurants adopting

2054
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,560
Well I now know that one was developed in Japan in 1930

2055
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,160
another one is this

2056
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,320
This is thought to have become popular later in China Town

2057
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,280
So in fact, when it became popular later, it didn’t follow

2058
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,460
Follow the male and female pool

2059
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,960
So that impact may be more limited

2060
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,760
So this your question is

2061
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,360
It's a very good and scientific question

2062
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,920
Unfortunately we didn't

2063
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,360
There is no way to trace this development

2064
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,560
and then just another

2065
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,120
Is it the group meal you mentioned?

2066
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,420
Actually that's an interesting question

2067
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:21,760
that is

2068
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,160
But now I also have a moment

2069
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,660
don't know how to answer

2070
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:29,000
Just saying the things we can tell is that

2071
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,460
I think this is one of my speeches today

2072
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,960
pretty big spindle

2073
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:34,760
That is to say, after the germ theory became popular

2074
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,760
It's actually very powerful

2075
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,300
that is, we might think

2076
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,500
It's just a way to control the disease

2077
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,260
But it actually got into our lives

2078
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:45,760
very detailed design

2079
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:47,960
For example, like all the food we buy now

2080
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,060
Almost all have plastic packaging, right?

2081
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:52,460
basically you don't trust any

2082
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:54,160
food without packaging

2083
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,460
because you feel the potential to contaminate

2084
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,320
This is also the situation after the germ theory became popular.

2085
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,380
But I want to eat in a group situation

2086
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:07,000
In fact, for example, whether in the army or in a factory

2087
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,200
That must have an interesting history worth studying

2088
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,040
Then I can't do anything right now

2089
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,500
don't know that much

2090
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
so no way to answer your good question

2091
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:17,000
add more teacher

2092
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,760
That is to say, in ancient times, a fair or a meeting of property officials

2093
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,760
change collective

2094
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,760
right

2095
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,760
It's also a big bunch

2096
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,460
right

2097
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:32,120
That ancient group of bamboo flowers one by one

2098
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:34,460
or sub-station

2099
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:35,460
will it be

2100
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:38,460
In ancient times, there were many infectious diseases

2101
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:38,960
yes

2102
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,460
would cause a big one

2103
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:42,960
An explosion of contagion

2104
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:43,460
right

2105
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,460
Also such an important one

2106
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,460
yes

2107
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,460
a stunned look

2108
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:47,460
Not possible to be

2109
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,960
But that's the point of today's story

2110
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,460
that's when you won't doubt

2111
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,460
passed on to you by people close to you

2112
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,460
But now you're highly skeptical

2113
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:56,960
people around you pass it on to you

2114
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,960
You may even suspect that your family passed it on to you

2115
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So much so that it changed one of you and your family

2116
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Look at the trust relationship of the people around you

2117
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Probably so. For intimacy.

2118
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
hello then

2119
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Your question first is very good

2120
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
In fact, it was later in 1949

2121
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
The Communist Party of China says

2122
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Fei Jie and is a society

2123
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And he said before

2124
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
The former capitalist Kuomintang

2125
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
don't care about everyone

2126
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
So you never really have to fix the problem

2127
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So the way they did it later was in the factory

2128
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
to build that

2129
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
that

2130
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
equal to field one

2131
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Then come to help with this problem

2132
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
So this is later

2133
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
That is, the Communist Party of China very much believes that

2134
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
They are different from the KMT's approach

2135
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
They are very highly publicized

2136
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
This is the side of Social Disease

2137
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
That is the only continuation of the period of the Kuomintang

2138
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
is for

2139
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Dealing with the problem of spitting

2140
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
So it turned out to be a major vice

2141
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
But that's another story

2142
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
But they do put a lot of emphasis on

2143
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,360
This is a social disease

2144
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,260
in a capitalist society

2145
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,260
unwilling to admit this social disease

2146
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,700
because you don't want to improve

2147
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,260
That is to say, a living environment for workers

2148
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,400
Probably such a situation

2149
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:14,000
And then you later Thomsman's argument

2150
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,460
I didn't understand that question very well

2151
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:17,200
can you explain more

2152
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,360
I didn't understand the second part very well

2153
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,200
The second part I want to ask is to say

2154
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:23,960
The old four don't treat that European member

2155
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:27,160
disease management point

2156
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:27,960
yes

2157
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:31,420
Because in these novels, for example, Stan

2158
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,860
Or like in that Fuko's book

2159
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,560
Or like in Thomasman's novel

2160
01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:40,260
I thought of some phenomena about Fei Jiehe

2161
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,260
if go to control

2162
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,060
How will he treat his phenomenon

2163
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,860
I don't know how the teacher treats this problem

2164
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:45,560
yes

2165
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,060
Fei Jiehe is sure you have heard of it

2166
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,760
Is there a Chinese art book?

2167
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:53,060
It was written by Su Zhenchang Pagoda

2168
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:55,560
Unice as the metaphor, right?

2169
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:57,760
That is Fei Jiehe is a special one, that is to say

2170
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,860
There are many descriptions in the literature

2171
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,640
because it is a chronic disease

2172
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:03,680
That is to say, and you can live a long time with this

2173
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:05,800
Then each has a lot of descriptions

2174
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:09,000
And once romanticized by that

2175
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,600
right

2176
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,540
So the childbirth thing I just talked about

2177
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:13,340
It's not just China

2178
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:14,900
Even in the West there are such descriptions

2179
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:18,580
That is, after the people who can talk about Feigehe

2180
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:21,600
That is to say, even women's faces will turn red

2181
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,600
Yes, then there is a stronger

2182
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,380
more delicate sensibility

2183
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,900
and love of life

2184
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:30,400
Then there are many love stories

2185
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,240
Then this one originally had such an image

2186
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,480
So it's actually quite a positive image.

2187
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:37,640
But so it's also about theater theory

2188
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:38,940
After the theatrical theory came

2189
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,640
when you see him you see a

2190
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,740
very different him

2191
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:43,640
just because you thought

2192
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,400
Because when the heroine was in the lungs

2193
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,640
In fact, when you are not contagious concepts

2194
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,900
you might think it's a

2195
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,300
a disease within him, right?

2196
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,440
so you might even think

2197
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,740
While he sells his body

2198
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:57,400
His inspiration even goes so far as to say

2199
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,900
The sensibility is enhanced

2200
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,300
love life more

2201
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,640
But when you see him later

2202
01:29:02,740 --> 01:29:04,700
when it becomes a sick head

2203
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,000
It's not easy to romanticize anymore

2204
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:08,800
So you see, it turns into saying

2205
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,100
that you are related to the poor

2206
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,400
This is also a very important point, right?

2207
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,100
It's that part that transforms

2208
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:18,100
Well, it's actually quite a complicated process.

2209
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:20,400
Because this disease is very long

2210
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,400
So there are a lot of people with a lot of related descriptions

2211
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,800
The simplest thing to say is to say

2212
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:28,000
At one point he experienced a

2213
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:29,600
A process of being romanticized

2214
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,400
later became considered a poor man's disease

2215
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,900
even a social issue

2216
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:34,800
roughly like this

2217
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:35,500
right

2218
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:39,800
Thank you Mr. Lei

2219
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:40,800
any left

2220
01:29:40,900 --> 01:29:42,500
we still have a little time

2221
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,400
opportunity for him to come

2222
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,000
Feel sorry

2223
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,800
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2224
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:53,900
I'm bope from the law firm

2225
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,300
Then I have a question is

2226
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,000
The teacher just had a powerpoint

2227
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,800
There are three identities mentioned

2228
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Does the teacher want to explain through these three identities

2229
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Why is the epidemic prevention from a scientific point of view

2230
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
That's another aspect of individualism

2231
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
That leads to not asking children to criticize the concept of family

2232
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
The first of these, identity, is national sovereignty.

2233
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I remember correctly, I was thinking

2234
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,000
What about national sovereignty because it sounds like a

2235
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
totalitarian concept of a society

2236
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
how could cause

2237
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
It can be explained that behind the promotion of individualism

2238
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Identity

2239
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
yeah sorry i miss me

2240
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
It's just that what I just said was not very clear

2241
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
In fact, it was just that

2242
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
What I said on that slide is actually

2243
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
We follow the prevention and control of this infectious disease

2244
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I just introduced three different systems, right?

2245
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
that each different system

2246
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Makes you pay different attention to dangerous boundaries

2247
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
that this focus on borders

2248
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
promotes a certain identity

2249
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,840
When isolation is easy

2250
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,600
That border is not on the skin

2251
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,400
right

2252
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,240
Not between people and the environment

2253
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,600
not between people

2254
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,200
This is the second and third

2255
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:11,400
The first one is spatial

2256
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:11,840
right

2257
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:13,200
What about the spatial result?

2258
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,000
that is

2259
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,840
So in fact, what is strengthened is

2260
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,200
I am your person in this space

2261
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,160
with that space of your human world

2262
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,600
different different

2263
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,040
and i'm going to separate from you

2264
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,960
And I think the danger comes from there

2265
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,000
So it's not an individualistic identification

2266
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,600
but a collective identity

2267
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:28,280
like

2268
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,760
Actually I think like

2269
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:30,760
Taiwan right?

2270
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,200
right now you feel like saying

2271
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:33,800
we are

2272
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,520
We have put the whole world

2273
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,200
Everywhere is considered a dangerous place

2274
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,760
only we are safe

2275
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,400
right

2276
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,360
The reason why this can be successful

2277
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,920
with us as a sovereign state

2278
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,560
manageable borders

2279
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:45,200
right

2280
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:48,120
And at the same time, it will make you feel more strongly

2281
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,920
The things around you are originally yours

2282
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,520
for example

2283
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,840
We really wanted to support Hong Kong

2284
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,160
But now you can't help but see it as

2285
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,560
a dangerous source

2286
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,400
it's just outside your homeland

2287
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,720
You are isolated from it

2288
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,000
This is also imperceptibly

2289
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It is a common interest of the people within this regime who can exercise sovereign control

2290
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
right

2291
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
You have common interests and your common security is protected

2292
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
People who are all within this line are united

2293
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
so it's really not personal

2294
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,000
but a situation within a sovereign state

2295
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Then the question you mentioned is actually

2296
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
That is also a main axis that I want to share with you today.

2297
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
that is

2298
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
So from this point of view

2299
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
We would have thought of this as a completely neutral treatment of disease.

2300
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
these sanitation systems

2301
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
It will invisibly strengthen certain boundaries

2302
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
and then make us even develop certain habits

2303
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
then make our impact on us

2304
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
In fact, it is far more than a temporary control of a disease.

2305
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
a far-reaching impact of

2306
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
probably like this

2307
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Thanks

2308
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
any left

2309
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Come

2310
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
the professor i want to ask a question

2311
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
just now

2312
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,820
When someone asked a question just now, it was mentioned that

2313
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,900
It is after World War II if the treatment fee is resolved.

2314
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:08,440
Just after the card is drawn out

2315
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:09,660
what i want to ask is

2316
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:11,780
just before the card is traced

2317
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:15,360
The treatment of health experts in the event is to only put those

2318
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:19,720
It's like improving ventilation or poor light production.

2319
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:22,520
or the home quarantine you just mentioned

2320
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:26,620
As far as those methods are concerned, my own thoughts are

2321
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:28,680
only to slow down the rate of infection

2322
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:30,740
for those already infected

2323
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:32,780
Health experts at the time were

2324
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,820
what method to take

2325
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:36,360
let them just

2326
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,660
is healed or

2327
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:39,700
what kind of therapy

2328
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,480
people who are already infected

2329
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,020
In fact, it can only be sent to a nursing home.

2330
01:33:43,020 --> 01:33:44,300
can do very limited

2331
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:47,120
From our perspective today, it is impossible to cure

2332
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:47,880
right

2333
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,960
Just let him fix the itch

2334
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,260
And then there's the sun

2335
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,780
then what else

2336
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:56,580
Anyway, from our perspective today, it’s like what you said

2337
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,840
None of them are effective treatments

2338
01:33:58,840 --> 01:33:59,880
just heal

2339
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,040
it's a treat

2340
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,820
yes that's the case

2341
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,100
yes

2342
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:21,500
we eat

2343
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,320
Not all Japanese dishes are like this

2344
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,860
dinner plate

2345
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,160
everyone eats their own

2346
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:32,320
Then when eating Chinese food, everyone will not be together

2347
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,000
even that

2348
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:35,280
that has that

2349
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:36,560
rotating

2350
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:38,240
Everyone at the dining table is still

2351
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:41,420
Can eating this together reflect that

2352
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,020
Japanese watermelon layers

2353
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,820
Influence of Freedom of Thought

2354
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,120
than China

2355
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,380
come deep

2356
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,660
or

2357
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,200
China

2358
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,500
Even if China

2359
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,800
With the emergence of this revolving dining table

2360
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Did it mean that liberalism was under the impact of the main ideas?

2361
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,000
did not completely change the thinking of the Chinese people

2362
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,000
That is to say, our Chinese-style dining table has its own bowls and plates

2363
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But there is still a public wooden spoon

2364
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Then the round dining table in the middle

2365
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:38,000
They just kind of have that area kind of like the line between the individual and the group

2366
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
stagnant forces like the conflict between national culture and liberalism

2367
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
can speak

2368
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
that thank you very much

2369
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Because I think you're actually continuing my question now, right?

2370
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
and make a comparison

2371
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
That means again two different cultures

2372
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
the different way you make them eat

2373
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,200
Does represent a different one

2374
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,800
Embracing Different Values

2375
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,800
can i say that

2376
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,200
Then can you put your last question in

2377
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,200
Ask me at the end in this context

2378
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:13,700
what do you mean

2379
01:36:13,700 --> 01:36:16,000
can you say a little more, yes

2380
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,500
which part did you say at the end

2381
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,300
Oh that's the question you wanted to ask me

2382
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,300
what to do what will you say in the end

2383
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,500
i mean can i say that

2384
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:31,000
Yes, that is to say, the influence of that trend of thought can be

2385
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,500
customary when reflected in that influence

2386
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:40,500
Uh, I think to a very large extent

2387
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,000
should be visible

2388
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,200
It's pretty obvious in my story, isn't it?

2389
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,000
as they were discussing

2390
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,800
while discussing on the one hand discussing

2391
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,200
How to protect hygiene from combined disease

2392
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:54,000
Maybe that aspect is also in the

2393
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,700
Some people are conscious, some people are not

2394
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:58,000
actually you are discussing

2395
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
what value are you embracing

2396
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
What else is worth maintaining, right?

2397
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
that's why i think so

2398
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
I think there are two parts to your question

2399
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,000
The first part is to say

2400
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
The Japanese way of eating

2401
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
It should be the way Japan eats

2402
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
It was only later in Japan that people ate like this, right?

2403
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I don't know about this

2404
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
i find it very interesting

2405
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
that's what i just said

2406
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
I just mentioned one I know better, that is

2407
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Conversely

2408
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
You see we were talking about individualism just now, right?

2409
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
But the Japanese feel that

2410
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
the way they used to eat

2411
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
that everyone eats everyone

2412
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Seems like everyone has a little one when eating

2413
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It lacks a sense of family

2414
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So I don't understand what is called modern family

2415
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
So instead they create a

2416
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
That round table on Batatami

2417
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
can be put away

2418
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
so that you can have a western-style modern family

2419
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So I just actually answered like this

2420
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
you mean to say

2421
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
In fact, in terms of Western civilization

2422
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Seems like you're not just an individualism

2423
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
right

2424
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
There is another one called modern family

2425
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,140
What kind of concept is HongSuiHong?

2426
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:05,000
Then there is someone in Japan who embraces that part

2427
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,540
in this way of dining

2428
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:11,000
then i don't know if i have answered your question now

2429
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
that

2430
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,000
you can ask me again

2431
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
yes

2432
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:24,000
Okay, thank you

2433
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
matter of time maybe our last question

2434
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Thank you, teacher

2435
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Then the picture I just came over becomes

2436
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
In fact, I also read the teacher's article

2437
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
The article about today's actor

2438
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
In fact, the teacher mentioned later that

2439
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
About the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party after 1949

2440
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
That is to say, because of the historical relationship

2441
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
So it means that the Communist Party is ruling on the earth wall of China

2442
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Then they are in public health

2443
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
In fact, there is a very different way

2444
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
For example, like what the teacher said just now

2445
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
is that they then become

2446
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
The so-called social disease thing

2447
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
There is one such system that happens

2448
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
In fact, I have also seen that they regard the matter of personal hygiene as a

2449
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,600
It's just that the teacher didn't write in the article just now

2450
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,100
become an intellectual

2451
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,300
It can be said that they are arrogant or that they are farmers from outside the cloud

2452
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:13,700
So instead they want to invite these intellectuals to

2453
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,500
For example, going down the mountain to the countryside

2454
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,500
Go to the countryside

2455
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,900
Then say to learn from these farmers

2456
01:39:17,900 --> 01:39:19,800
Then I also want to ask about another one like this

2457
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,500
In the process of changing from individualism to collectivism

2458
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:27,500
How have their public health policies changed?

2459
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,000
wow you this is a big question

2460
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,400
This is really a very, very big problem

2461
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,100
sorry

2462
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,500
what should i say

2463
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,000
Um

2464
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
That is to say, in fact, today I

2465
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,500
What is emphasized here is that there are some

2466
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,760
pertaining to cultural values

2467
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,160
In the example you gave

2468
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,960
a big part is to say

2469
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,960
I see what to say

2470
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:15,160
In fact, what I said was actually about

2471
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,260
The difference between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is not only the political system

2472
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:20,000
their different ideas

2473
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
also reflected in their view

2474
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,400
What is an awakened person

2475
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,200
what is hygiene worth pursuing

2476
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,460
are also different

2477
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,360
Actually, look at what we just said in the Fa lecture.

2478
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,320
more or less actually you still

2479
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:34,020
It is the introduction of a Western concept of hygiene

2480
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:34,720
right

2481
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:36,560
Awakened person you should

2482
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:39,280
Know to use your personal hygiene cup

2483
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:39,960
right

2484
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,060
Even if you think you want to maintain

2485
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,680
your original family life

2486
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:46,220
You must at least cooperate with the male chopsticks and the female pool

2487
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:49,580
In order to inevitably transmit the bacteria to other people

2488
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:50,420
then i just

2489
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,860
You said that the guidance of that article is to say

2490
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,780
I was quite surprised to see that

2491
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:57,360
That is to say, the Communist Party members in Yan'an will emphasize that

2492
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,220
you should not pay attention to hygiene

2493
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:00,220
Because you paid attention to hygiene at that time

2494
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,740
you will be out of the crowd

2495
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:06,240
So this instead means that you have not awakened a transition point

2496
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,600
That's actually what you just asked

2497
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,240
I find it hard to answer

2498
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,740
It's just that I think this involves a very big problem

2499
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:15,740
That is to say, I think the Communist Party and the Kuomintang

2500
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:16,840
there is a very big difference

2501
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:20,240
Which means they also think they embrace science

2502
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,640
but they think they can hug

2503
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,140
is a different science

2504
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:25,840
Science as opposed to the bourgeois West

2505
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,240
It's a so-called follower of the public

2506
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,440
A science of mass union

2507
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,280
And this can become a very different science

2508
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,780
Including their later policy on TCM as well

2509
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,640
so because you just said

2510
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,540
What are the different public health policies

2511
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,040
In fact, a big one is to say

2512
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,600
They believe they can develop a

2513
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,480
Used by more people

2514
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:44,980
To include the policy of TCM

2515
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:46,940
That's actually a very big subject.

2516
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:49,740
that one and another

2517
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:51,040
one part is to say

2518
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,380
Conversely, that is

2519
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,040
that for example like

2520
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,740
Originally, during the period of the Nationalist Party

2521
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:57,340
Injection of smallpox vaccine

2522
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:58,940
Only a few million people at most

2523
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:00,140
1950 to 1950

2524
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
The CCP has vaccinated 100 to 200 million people

2525
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
So in fact that becomes saying

2526
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
you have an unprecedented strength

2527
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
to get vaccinated

2528
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
At the same time, it may be behind

2529
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
The issue of account control

2530
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
That's what we see today

2531
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
combine

2532
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
This should belong to Mr. Zeng

2533
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
The question of the relationship between the political society is that

2534
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
how do you put technology right

2535
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
one combined with political control

2536
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
a story

2537
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So when you just said

2538
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
i have a hard time answering

2539
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
I think it's a

2540
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
very large and important

2541
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Important issues

2542
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,000
right

2543
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
as we end today's

2544
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
prior to this knowledge

2545
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
allow me 30 seconds

2546
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
a little advance notice

2547
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
our next speech

2548
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
when is our next speech

2549
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
it was on april 26

2550
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
same time

2551
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
7:00 to 8:30

2552
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
the same place

2553
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
then we are

2554
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
In memory of former Dean Gu

2555
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Then we invited

2556
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Taipei Medical University

2557
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Chair Professor Academician Liu Fang

2558
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
he came to speak for us

2559
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
From housing to longevity

2560
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
unlock

2561
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,100
common mechanism

2562
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:05,040
Then if this is because of this series of this in our middle school

2563
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,920
Dean Gu's
