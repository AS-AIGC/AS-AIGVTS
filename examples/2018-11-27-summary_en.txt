In this sharing session, researchers who graduated from the Department of Chemistry at National Taiwan University introduced their research results for many years, exploring how neurons affect the life course in terms of development and genetics. The researchers used fruit flies and mice as research subjects to explore the influence of proneural genes on the formation of sensory organs. Cell competition and cooperation play important roles in the process of cell division and influence cell development; for example, achieving alignment, responding to environmental changes, etc. Research on brain plasticity, neuron function and apoptosis also shows that the progress of neuroscience is of great significance for understanding the process of disease development. In terms of Parkinson's disease research, researchers have used fruit flies to find drugs with palliative and therapeutic effects, and found that traditional Chinese medicine may also have a protective effect on Parkinson's disease. Researchers continue to explore the application potential of these chemical molecules. Researchers looking for a better combination of ingredients to curb the onset of Parkinson's disease, point to unconstrained ideas that may be effective for some types of Parkinson's disease. Studying behavioral changes in Drosophila allows for the observation of neurodegeneration linked to the axotomy process. Scientists stress the ethics of gender identity and gene editing research. Pegasus has a protective effect, but whether it can treat Parkinson's disease remains to be proven. Alzheimer's research has no definitive answer. This video emphasizes that exercise has a curative effect on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, while coffee and smoking only have an associated protective effect. Finally, the film discusses the division of the optic nerve in processing visual information and the differences in human sensitivity to color. ,
