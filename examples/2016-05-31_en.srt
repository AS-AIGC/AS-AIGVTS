00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,060
MUSIC

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
MUSIC

3
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,500
Today's speaker

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,660
is Dr. Gao Shen of medium-Buy Cloud Academy

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,000
at the Center for Im👉

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,780
of Health andler Gespr Nan Story

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,560
o FS is Shu NF Eng

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,240
So Dr. Shen

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,080
let me introduce

10
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,300
θ i when

11
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,660
study of plant rather than

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,080
aching

13
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,000
you

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,440
Changed from immobile to moving animals

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,160
So it this across two

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,080
Both animals and plants are well studied

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,320
Then it went abroad

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,480
I just listened to talk to you

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,440
it comes first to this

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,960
Konell University

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,840
Konell at Ethika

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,640
OK

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,400
Behavior-based

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,800
Come to Qingxiu

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,640
Then after getting a Ph.D., I went to a short Ph.D. university

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,200
then postdoc

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,160
Then to Kenbridge in the UK

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
My understanding is the UK

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,520
Kenbridge

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,600
I just heard his explanation

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,000
This is evolutionary

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,040
masters are like darwin

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,120
right there

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,240
this

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,000
made some of the discoveries for which he was famous

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,880
But I later found out that Darwin didn't seem to have any degrees.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,800
It seems that the family is very rich, so they wander around

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,500
The whole world has been passed around

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,900
but made a very, very important discovery

40
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
the theory of evolution

41
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,500
Today's theory of evolution

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,800
I think our Mr. Shen seems to want to break a part of him

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,300
let's listen to his speech

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,000
Then his teacher Shen's research

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,700
Combining many of these cross-cutting technologies

46
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,100
that he

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,400
In fact, I saw a theory called game

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
This Game Theory

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,900
remind me of this

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,100
I wonder if you have seen this movie called "Beautiful Realm"

51
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,200
This "Beautiful Realm" Ross Crowe

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,300
just play a nobel prize winner

53
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,500
That he is because of game theory

54
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,700
nobel prize

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,200
That is the application in this aspect of economics

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,300
that's just the unfortunate one

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can tell now whether I was at the beginning of this year or last year

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Died in a car accident in New York

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But this Ross Clough

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
admired movie star

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He also made a movie I just told them about

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He also made a warship

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
not the warships of the american and british navies

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then was chased by French warships

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Later ran to an island called Para

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
called Para

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's called Para, and a lot of it is observed from that side.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
from

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So this evolution is a very interesting set

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Teacher Shen came back to Taiwan around 2010

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In the future, we will do very close contact

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He won the young assistant award of our central researcher in 2014

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is in Taiwan

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you are a young assistant award, you will get a young assistant

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,940
It will probably be smooth sailing in the future

76
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,940
is it like this

77
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,940
so very

78
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,440
But he worked very hard

79
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,440
so early this year

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,940
Because I'm the vice president

81
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
I want to take a look inside our courtyard

82
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,940
young works

83
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,940
he has an article

84
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Part I Evolutionary Aspects

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,940
in Science Magazine

86
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
Science

87
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
anyway science magazine

88
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,940
It is indeed a top magazine

89
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
if you can get on top

90
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
is a very remarkable thing

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,940
especially if you're at home

92
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,940
able to do research like this

93
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,940
I read the above author

94
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,940
are our local authors

95
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,940
It seems to mean cooperation or not

96
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,940
That's a pretty remarkable achievement

97
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,940
I'm very pleased to see this

98
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Our Central Plains Institute was recently said to be

99
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,940
very unbearable

100
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
so today

101
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
Seeing so many people come to support me

102
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,940
thanks a lot

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,800
We finally have to keep trying

104
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,000
We're working hard to get this new dean thing done

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We hope this gives you good news soon

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Today I have a chance to have dinner with the President and the Vice President

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If you don't believe me, I'll wait for that

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I have a picture, and I am alone

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So what they tell us is comfort

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're finally doing alright, so don't worry

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
so we'll keep trying

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This Knowledge Court series is a good example

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We're here with our neighbors and a lot of young people

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Today let's listen to the theory of using the game in this game

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How to discuss this very serious "born in sorrow"

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Die from a comforting ecological R&D incident

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,040
Our secretariat taught me what I must say

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,440
Our next feast of knowledge

119
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,840
It's about Nanke archeology

120
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,240
So it's also very interesting stuff

121
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,120
Archeology is not just in the ground

122
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,440
Flowers look at the bones

123
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,520
There are many little questions in it

124
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,680
So welcome to the feast of knowledge next month

125
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,880
come and listen

126
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,800
we warmly welcome

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,640
come on teacher

128
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,240
OK, thank you, Vice President.

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,280
use my introduction

130
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
And thank you all for listening to me tonight

131
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,960
Well, let me state that

132
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,840
This topic is actually

133
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,400
In fact, it was decided a long time ago

134
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,440
It has nothing to do with recent events

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,960
But maybe in the end

136
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,840
It may be found that there is still a little relationship

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,640
Of course that's what we're talking about

138
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,160
Raw fish optimizes fish eating case

139
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,000
of course i am

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,400
Trying to remember this he made a mistake

141
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,460
This is what Mencius said

142
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,000
Then everyone can maybe not see

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
I can read it to everyone

144
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Actually, I think he will talk later

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,640
That is to say, he would actually say this

146
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,200
Is born and died in peace

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
In fact, in the history of China

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
he has his usual background

149
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,000
but anyway

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
that's what he said

151
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,100
from the individual

152
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,640
He gave several examples

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,200
It is said that these people who later became very successful

154
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,100
In fact, the process of growing up

155
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,600
all in some very formerly possible

156
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,000
In this humble environment

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,140
then he said

158
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,940
This Tianjiang descends to the world

159
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,240
You must first suffer your mind

160
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,200
Tired muscles and painful second stage body skin

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,000
And so he talked about this mechanism

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
that's what he said

163
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,700
Therefore, it is impossible to tempt and endure disputes

164
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,500
Then I talked about some of these

165
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,540
and wait a minute

166
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,940
He became the speaker of this harsh environment

167
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,140
After the impact on the individual

168
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,740
He actually further promotes

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,440
It is the invincible foreign patient Guo Hengwang

170
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,040
Then the fuselage also got sick and died in peace

171
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,540
what about here

172
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,340
If you analyze this word carefully

173
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,800
You can see that the first part actually talks about

174
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,840
The twenty-six environment actually has a positive impact on the individual

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,140
what about the second part

176
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,980
It is to say that the 26th environment has a positive impact on the group

177
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,140
Of course I'll tell you later

178
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,040
In fact, it was the past two years that I spent

179
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,780
I also spent some time looking at these documents

180
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,780
These are the documents in China

181
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,080
Then I will try to see if there is a more scientific method.

182
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,580
How about explaining the twenty-six environment?

183
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,380
Is it true for individuals or groups

184
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,680
have a positive impact

185
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,780
Of course, obviously, I don't think it fits my intuition very well.

186
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
so i'll talk about it later

187
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,880
In fact, we can learn from the example of ecological evolution

188
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,980
Then I will give you some practical examples

189
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,380
go talk about the idea

190
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,680
It is the adaptation of organisms to the twenty-six environment

191
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,080
whether individual

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,020
How does it affect the perspective of the group?

193
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,520
I just said that

194
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,000
In fact, after reading these Chinese literature,

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Only to find out that in fact, birth is better than death

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
It turns out that of course I don't understand very well

197
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,220
If you guys have experts wait a minute

198
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,320
can teach again

199
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,820
That is to say I look like there are mainly two parts

200
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,420
pros and cons

201
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,520
A lot of people refer to it as called priority awareness

202
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,220
But the other part is that

203
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,120
really bad environment

204
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
That is actually in the study of philosophy

205
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,320
It seems that priority awareness is more important

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
so feel like saying

207
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,320
No matter what the environment, people must have a sense of priority and danger

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,620
Then I'll talk about it later

209
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,220
In fact, I think Mencius made a big breakthrough

210
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,120
In fact, he thinks that

211
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,820
environment itself is important

212
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,020
not only you have this awareness

213
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,920
Then from the perspective of life

214
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
wait a minute i will tell you

215
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,620
That is to say, in fact, for individuals and groups

216
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,820
The impact of the environment will actually be very different

217
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,220
because for the group

218
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,920
is always what you're going to think about saying

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,400
Performance of selfish individuals and groups

220
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,040
The two may sometimes be together

221
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,600
sometimes conflicting

222
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,240
Then let me simply introduce to you

223
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,820
In fact, this phantom consciousness

224
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,440
The word Youfan is in Chinese

225
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,860
It may be the earliest appearance of this fine word calculation in the Book of Changes.

226
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,320
He actually introduced a book about Zhouyi

227
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Then say why that did

228
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,200
At that time, King Wen made this Sutra

229
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
It's actually for that era

230
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,300
is the generation is not very good

231
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,640
So he has state-owned people

232
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,440
So I made this idea

233
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,400
And actually, I think in our culture

234
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,680
I often hear this

235
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,240
That is to say, for example, people are far away from laws and disadvantages.

236
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,120
that you have to think about saying

237
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,380
something bad might happen in the future

238
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,120
you're going to prepare for this

239
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,820
Then, just like Fan Zhongyan said, worry about the world's worries first

240
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,760
So in fact our culture is actually

241
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,100
I have always encouraged everyone to think about it

242
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,000
You have to think about what to do if you say something bad

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll talk about it later

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
In fact, I think this is only part of

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And this part is often

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
i'm in our real life

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
there are many misused

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In addition, what I want to talk about today

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
A big theme is to say

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The impact of harsh environment

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I just read this

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
In fact, Mencius thought it was a bad environment

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I will be tempted and bear to dispute what I can't

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That is, if he thinks

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you encounter a lot of bad situations alone

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
many setbacks

257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In fact, you will think about it

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
what can i improve

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then maybe you can make yourself better like this

260
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Then like this Ouyang Xiu he will talk

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
How hard it is to help Yingyou get up

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That is to say, when everyone faces setbacks

263
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Whether it is a country or an individual

264
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sometimes it might not be so bad

265
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
In the end, I will mention this example later.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's from Sun Tzu's Art of War

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In fact, I think this is a very classic example

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,460
Wait a minute, in fact, it also fits well in our idioms and pictorial media.

269
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,000
That is to say, this investment king, He Zhun, is limited to the field, so that future generations

270
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,120
The reason is that I will talk about it later.

271
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,420
Actually it's about the group

272
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,620
In fact, there are many times when a group needs a very harsh environment

273
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,420
Only then will we let go of ourselves and work together to achieve things

274
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,060
OK, let's just tell everyone

275
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,760
Wait a minute, the speech will be divided into three parts

276
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,380
It's basically my past research

277
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,280
Three types of emphasis

278
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,780
The first is the impact of the ecological environment on idioms and pictorial media

279
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,780
Then to the Nepalese Malay Dirty Worm

280
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,480
And then finally the impact on this distribution of this spinal cord animal

281
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,080
Well, in fact, the birth control history mentioned earlier

282
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,560
same everyone can remember

283
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,720
In fact, I will keep mentioning, that is, the ecological environment

284
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,520
Effects on all aspects of animals

285
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,120
The first thing we want to mention is the total

286
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
game theory

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
Then of course game theory is

288
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,040
It's the game

289
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,400
Talking about how your strategy should change with other people's strategy

290
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,040
of course

291
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,240
The game is everywhere in this

292
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
then i won't talk very carefully

293
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,400
What are the games in it?

294
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,160
But you could say it's basically the idea of ​​strategy

295
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,440
then we study

296
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,480
The species studied in the first part was the crested plum

297
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,680
The crown feather plum is a unique species of bird in Taiwan

298
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,040
In fact, if you go to the mountains in Taiwan

299
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,120
is that it is very commonly seen

300
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
It is basically the most common in mountainous areas in Taiwan

301
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,320
The most commonly seen bird species

302
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,520
What about what we're going to talk about later?

303
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,760
just a lot of it

304
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,200
In this special book on appreciation of cooperation published this year

305
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,920
We have been invited to write one of the

306
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,080
Then the crown feather plum is very special.

307
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
is that it has a very special social organization

308
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,400
monogamy

309
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,740
One husband and one wife share one dynasty, that is to say

310
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,340
In fact, they have an obvious pairing relationship.

311
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,760
Then what

312
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,260
This high-ranked pair and this red-ranked pair

313
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,200
Then they will defend a field together

314
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,200
Then they will order together in the same nest

315
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,200
Then what

316
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,800
The orderly thing is that they are the high-ranking companions

317
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
Pairing and red-ranked pairing

318
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,960
they actually

319
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
often just nest together

320
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,160
Hatching eggs and feeding babies together

321
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,800
What about the whole world?

322
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,700
About 9% of bird species

323
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,800
It is the case of cooperating to have a child together

324
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,640
but only about less than 20

325
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,900
There are about 10,000 species of birds in the world

326
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,900
That's why there are about 900 species that reproduce cooperatively.

327
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,000
but only less than 20 species are used together in one nest

328
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,540
then you can imagine that

329
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,500
In fact, using a nest together has many disadvantages

330
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,100
like

331
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,700
You probably don't like being with strangers very much either.

332
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,700
living together in the same place

333
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,700
That is, social life is full of conflicts.

334
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,500
That's but on the screen basis

335
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,900
it can share a nest

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
then take care of

337
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,740
So we can study how they work together

338
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,000
how to resolve the conflict

339
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,100
Then this is just a basic introduction to some idiomatic language media

340
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,400
What about idiomatic media?

341
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,240
His main breeding group just mentioned

342
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,540
Consists mainly of individuals who are not relatives

343
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,740
Then we only need most of the biological social groups

344
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,100
are with relatives

345
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,000
Then there is the idiomatic medium

346
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,040
He actually lives in groups for the most part.

347
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,640
He has very few individuals that are

348
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,480
alone and these pairs of individuals

349
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,800
is very unstable

350
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,180
mean actually

351
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,380
Almost all idiomatic discourse-mediated groups

352
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,380
are with others

353
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,980
Especially when working with strangers

354
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,380
So group life is for them

355
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,140
very important part

356
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,440
So we can go to research and say

357
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,640
How does he maintain a stable cooperative relationship?

358
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,480
Let me tell you about these photos

359
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,820
In fact, if you see idiomatic media in the wild

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,020
it's almost always in a group

361
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,300
they do everything together

362
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,860
you can see bathing together

363
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,160
rest together eat together

364
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,000
even sleep together

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,060
is their feet

366
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,900
Then this is our social circle

367
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,400
It's just him sleeping and huddling together like this

368
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,060
Then there is the place we studied in Taiwan

369
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,100
He Huanshan, I haven't reached He Huanshan yet

370
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,560
National Taiwan University Coal Wind Experimental Farm

371
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
The risks over there are quite beautiful.

372
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,600
There is a great advantage that

373
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,300
because it is an experimental farm

374
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,700
So there's actually a good way inside

375
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,100
Can let us walk on those roads to chase these birds

376
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,700
This is our net

377
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,100
it's a tall net

378
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,600
This is the consort painting plum

379
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,100
Then we have to grab it and put on the anklet

380
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,400
so we're sort of like their id

381
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,800
we can know who it is

382
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,600
In addition, the concubine painting plum is that its tide is very high

383
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
About eight meters on average

384
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
In the past, in fact, I have studied crowns and painted cotton since the beginning of Dashan

385
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:08,460
Before that, it was the founder who started the business

386
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,100
So we used to go to its grass alley very high

387
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,140
It's like I used to learn how to build a scaffold

388
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,860
then or like a circus

389
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,200
this is a bamboo pole

390
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,500
it's me if you can see it

391
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,520
then we

392
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,140
Take a bamboo pole, and then there are two students below, so they pull me by the rope

393
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,960
Then I climb up this bamboo pole

394
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,520
Then because I want to talk about his just now, for example, his

395
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,340
Most of them are not relatives, so we have to draw blood to test

396
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,640
his kinship

397
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,500
Then all kinds of things like this, but they came to me when they had something to do, because I finally crawled inside like this

398
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,420
Then, but later, after I started to study for a Ph.D., I felt

399
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,540
Of course it looks like fun, but it's not fun to climb these grasses in the wild

400
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,860
So later we got this aerial work vehicle, which was just mentioned in Meifeng

401
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
has a good road system

402
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,600
then i can tell you

403
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,100
The master who came to repair this aerial work vehicle

404
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,000
When we drive on those mountain roads

405
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,100
Just tell me you can get a license

406
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,800
If there is a need for a construction site

407
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,500
can go to support

408
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,300
Because I can drive better than any of them

409
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,500
Because none of us are driving mountain roads like this

410
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,300
then but what

411
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,800
because it's often afternoon

412
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,200
So there are a lot of roadside assistance

413
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
So at that time actually

414
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,200
If you limit the truck

415
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,600
Actually I will save too

416
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,100
Because this car is more difficult to salvage than a truck

417
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,900
and then what else

418
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,800
Because the blame is gone

419
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,300
is that he is actually very small

420
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,800
Of course the picture looks huge

421
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,700
But in fact he's only 12 grams

422
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
So it's about that big

423
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,700
Then what we have to do is

424
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,700
Actually a very important job

425
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,200
That's the tide we're going to find him

426
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,700
The only way to find his tide

427
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000
That is, you have to look at the top of his mouth

428
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
When I started my idle poems

429
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Then here is already an idle chef

430
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,900
Royal chef is actually very easy to see

431
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Eyes can probably see his mouth growling

432
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
But according to the requirements of our research

433
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,780
In fact, when he started spinning spider silk

434
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,600
Because he's going to weave the leaves together to make this tide

435
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
So in the beginning it was idle spider silk

436
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,440
So when we were doing research

437
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
In fact, you have to find a way to see him.

438
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,540
It's like a little bit of spider silk hanging from the mouth

439
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,360
then you follow him

440
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,000
and see where he flies

441
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,400
like here's one of his tides

442
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,040
that's why go so fast

443
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
It must be found at the beginning of the main tide.

444
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,040
that is

445
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
because we later

446
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,440
It is using this RFID called wireless camera

447
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,040
That is, we will punch this chip in his body.

448
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,040
And then we're going to be in his tide

449
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,840
Install this pinhole camera

450
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,440
There is also an induction coil

451
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,040
was still very young

452
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
Then

453
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
So in order to install these things

454
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,840
That's because he's a tiny bird

455
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,640
So he's actually very sensitive

456
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,240
So when we do any of these operations

457
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
actually at night

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,160
So I just talked about driving that raw sauce car

459
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,200
There are many times when we actually want to open at night

460
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,720
then in the mountain road

461
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,000
Then what

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,720
Um

463
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,520
When the tide starts to build

464
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,820
That means he hasn't placed an order yet

465
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,020
then tell us later

466
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,820
The very crucial result is

467
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,920
Because there was a big conflict when he placed the order

468
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,160
So we're going to

469
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,100
He installed the equipment before he placed the order

470
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,400
What about this hole camera?

471
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,700
After this chip

472
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,860
we can

473
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,160
Just know who does what in the tide

474
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,880
Then what

475
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
It is also important to say

476
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,880
He is actually not affected by the weather

477
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,520
That's because everyone knows

478
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,080
Maybe the rainy season will come later this year

479
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,160
But everyone lives in Nangang

480
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,480
should be used to the rain

481
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Of course I don't live in Nangang

482
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,920
but on the mountain

483
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,680
That is, his breeding season starts from March to April

484
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,920
that lasted until about august

485
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,320
That's actually

486
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
you can think

487
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
That is April and May is the rainy season

488
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,160
Then what

489
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,720
From July to August there will be another typhoon

490
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,720
So in fact, when studying the viewing screen,

491
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
the big challenge is

492
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There are many times when the weather is bad

493
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Of course, as I just said, what if you look at it with net glasses?

494
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That is, if it rains or fogs up

495
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Even if you are working hard, the data you collect is still limited.

496
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But we also have installed this

497
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This pinhole camera and this

498
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
RFID is after the chip

499
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
We can continuously collect the information we want

500
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And it's almost impossible to go wrong

501
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's what I just said

502
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Because we want to study the impact of the ecological environment on its cooperation and conflict

503
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Then let's take a look at the environment of this mountainous area in Taiwan.

504
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
How about the ecological environment

505
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
After that, actually

506
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It has five or six months of breeding agent in a year

507
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then it can be used up to four or nine times in one dose

508
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The biggest challenge for it is to say

509
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Typhoon, heavy rain and this food supplement

510
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So it reproduced successfully, its forty-four probably only succeeded twice on average

511
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And because he is very small, there are many natural enemies that will attack him.

512
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But because he is small, he has no way to fight his natural enemies

513
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Then we will talk about it later, that is to say, his cooperation has a lot to do with these characteristics of him.

514
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
In fact, he will continue to fail

515
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Then he couldn't fight against his natural enemy

516
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Of course, there is no way for him to go directly to the typhoon, don’t come, or don’t rain.

517
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So all he can do is say he's actually going to keep trying again

518
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
OK, let's see if we can play it

519
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Well, it's a video, but it's actually kind of brutal.

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But take a look, this is a shark thrush

521
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is what our pinhole camera looks like

522
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
This black is our induction coil

523
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Then this is a very long experience, that is to say, it is actually a mackerel thrush.

524
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But he is a bird

525
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:13,060
Then why did it break? It's because something is pulling us. This is the grass.

526
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
It's the grass that was actually eaten.

527
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,560
It's just a bird that gets eaten whole.

528
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:22,800
Then I just said that because it is called Huamei, it is actually very small.

529
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,160
So its natural enemies, for example, are some relatively large birds.

530
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,240
or snakes or poisons

531
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
actually eat them

532
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
In fact, we often see

533
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Then you can see the blue bird over there

534
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
it can only be next to

535
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,240
is vigilance

536
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Then you feel that you are a bit bad, that is to say

537
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,240
It seems that I can only cry next to me

538
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
what it can't do

539
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
So after a while they will actually move on soon

540
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,240
Just move on to the next slot

541
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,240
Well, there is of course something special about this video, that is,

542
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,240
actually eat their grass

543
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,240
unfortunately that

544
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
see later

545
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's actually something you can't imagine

546
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's actually mud

547
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This is of course just an incidental question

548
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
That is, the United States actually has research

549
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that wild cat

550
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Millions of birds are eaten a year in the US

551
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So dogs don't

552
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
cats are wild animals

553
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
very big threat

554
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Because they're actually pretty good

555
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
good

556
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I just said that

557
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We are actually in the crown shadow screen

558
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'll talk later

559
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
what we see is that

560
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The impact of the ecological environment on it

561
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Of course it hasn't really been said

562
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Well, I'll introduce it later

563
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
That is to say, it is actually like this

564
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The concept of being in the same boat

565
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let me show you a video first

566
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,100
This crown clashes with the Huamei it occurs

567
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,800
The reason it's black and white is to say

568
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,100
This happens every morning

569
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,600
This can be seen in almost all the grasslands where the crown and plum blossoms are propagated.

570
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,700
These are two females

571
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,600
Just now a female has been sitting in the bottom half

572
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
And what about this female?

573
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,900
it's a multiple of eight

574
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,100
They'll be the island defenders who lay eggs

575
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,300
the female inside

576
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,300
after it was born

577
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,600
it will always be there

578
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,300
then don't let others in

579
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,800
And then another female who wants to lay eggs like this

580
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,600
it must be squeezed all the time

581
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
and squeezed in like this

582
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,500
The other one was squeezed out by it

583
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,500
then you can see

584
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,800
wait a minute you can see

585
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,000
It actually suits us to know it's finished giving birth

586
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,300
Then you see it is still very reconciled

587
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,900
it still has to squeeze it out

588
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,400
so we'll talk later

589
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,500
One of the main conflicts we want to quantify

590
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,600
It's the bloody conflict

591
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,100
they are actually

592
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,680
spend a lot of time fighting

593
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,640
It's just pushing back and forth over there

594
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,460
so we'll talk later

595
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,360
That is to say, we mainly look at three conflicts

596
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,280
One is the egg fight just mentioned

597
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,760
Then the number of eggs laid

598
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
and the time when the hatching begins at night

599
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,200
Of course you can say

600
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,320
Why the number of eggs laid

601
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,920
Is it a conflict with the time when the egg hatching starts at night?

602
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,040
the reason is this

603
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,160
when they fight

604
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Actually decide the first

605
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,720
It's the strategy of who can give birth to eggs

606
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,840
as if a female bird

607
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
he wants to fuck

608
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,240
Then he managed to prevent

609
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,120
Another hen lays eggs

610
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,360
so the first day

611
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,800
Only this A can lay eggs

612
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,880
and then the next day

613
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,680
Well, both of them are fucked

614
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,880
Then what

615
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,960
But what about this female bird?

616
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,440
he succeeded

617
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,680
Because he successfully prevented others from laying eggs

618
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,920
So if he is on this day

619
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,840
if he also hatches eggs

620
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,760
These three eggs will be on the first day

621
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,440
Just being hatched together, starting to hatch

622
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,560
the bird's egg means

623
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,160
he hatches eggs

624
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So these three eggs will actually develop first

625
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Then the egg develops later

626
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The result is the so-called different skin

627
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You can see that this is

628
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Chick days and chick weight

629
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The situation of different skins

630
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Is it these precocious individuals?

631
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
In fact, it will be heavier

632
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
That's because the crown hidden without it

633
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
it only takes 12 days

634
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
baby birds can leave the grass

635
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
so you are early

636
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
In fact, you can see that this is the weight

637
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
The lightest more than one

638
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It comes out about 1.6 grams

639
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but otherwise

640
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Individuals who come out prematurely

641
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It may have reached 3 or 4 grams

642
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
so more than double the weight

643
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So this is for their competition

644
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Actually a very important step

645
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So from here the continuation is to say

646
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
you have to win you have to lay eggs

647
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Then you hatch the eggs like this

648
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
your child can

649
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
win at the starting point

650
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Then what

651
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But the other case is that

652
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If you do not succeed in preventing others from

653
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Eggs are born, everyone is born

654
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
good

655
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,960
Then, everyone's eggs were spread together

656
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,600
Then it's more likely to happen like this

657
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Synchronization

658
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,840
Everyone is a child, the weight will be closer

659
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,480
Well, let's talk about it later

660
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,640
The ecological environment has a great influence on their cooperation with Xunxi

661
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,440
Next, let's talk about the impact of the ecological environment on him.

662
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,960
The ecological environment we are talking about here is rainfall.

663
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,920
it's raining

664
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,920
then we can see that this is just an indicator

665
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,320
That is to say, when the rain is heavier, it is actually called Huamei.

666
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,080
It is Vietnam that finds food to feed its children

667
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,560
Then why are you talking about this?

668
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
In fact, when we were submitting

669
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,120
One of the biggest problems is

670
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,760
That is, everyone is very skeptical

671
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,000
Why is it a bad environment when it rains

672
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,520
why not a good environment

673
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,720
So one of the proofs is that

674
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,840
If you have, for example,

675
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,360
For example, say you go to the mountains and it rains

676
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,880
In fact, the temperature is quite cold

677
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,840
And that is to say, there is a belt of clouds and mist in this plum wind

678
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,160
So in fact we did not analyze

679
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
That is to say, when it rains, it often

680
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,440
Cotton-length fish just keeps falling like this

681
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,400
instead of saying like for example if you go

682
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,240
Go to Africa, go to Kenya

683
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,600
I didn't do another study there

684
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,640
rain is short

685
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,940
For example, it rains every afternoon

686
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,040
just download a lot

687
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,600
but otherwise diligent

688
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,740
So for many ecologists

689
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,440
In fact, for them, the heavy rainfall

690
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,340
is a bad environment

691
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,240
It's actually a weird thing

692
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,340
But this viewing screen

693
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,400
In fact, we have several pieces of evidence showing that

694
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,640
In fact, rain is a relatively harsh environment for it.

695
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,800
we can see that is to say

696
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,840
The result is that the black BAR

697
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,600
This is the rather intense conflict just mentioned.

698
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,800
white just step on it

699
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,480
Then you can see this fierce conflict

700
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,300
that is, if it rains

701
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,640
It only lasts about six minutes or so

702
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,540
Actually quite long

703
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,080
It's what they need

704
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,700
This averages six minutes

705
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,280
then but in good weather

706
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,640
it is actually

707
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Sorry, it was about three minutes just now

708
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,040
when the weather is good

709
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,740
it can last longer

710
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,040
can

711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,360
So in six or seven minutes, just step on there

712
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,240
So you can see that indeed

713
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,960
when the weather is good

714
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,920
He actually has a high level of social conflict

715
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,640
play for a long time

716
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,200
then when the weather is nice

717
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,200
In fact, because I just said

718
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,560
That is, he actually fought for a long time

719
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,320
Then it's more likely that someone will win

720
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,280
So we have analysis

721
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Then something like this would be generated

722
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,960
just someone will wait

723
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,760
will start hatching earlier

724
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,000
It's you who beat Mr. Egg

725
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,240
you start brooding

726
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,680
hatch your eggs

727
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,160
Then the other one might be more intuitive

728
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,960
That is to say, when the environment is good

729
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,440
black eggs

730
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,600
good environment

731
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,360
Everyone lays more eggs

732
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,640
There are more eggs in one tank

733
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,160
That's a bad environment

734
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,720
Everyone lays fewer eggs

735
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,280
but the fun is here

736
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,080
That is to say, on the contrary, these

737
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,560
born at a bad time

738
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,480
black is bad

739
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,520
children born at the same time

740
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,400
Actually in the end

741
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,400
its weight is relatively heavy

742
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
where X is the number of days

743
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
Y is the weight of the chick

744
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,000
Then this dotted line is in a better environment

745
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,600
On the contrary, its weight is relatively light

746
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,600
The reason is very simple

747
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
this is another

748
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,600
Another same result

749
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,400
just behaving differently

750
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,600
is you can watch this

751
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,800
Even though there are few children born in a bad environment

752
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,600
But in fact, there are actually fewer children who die.

753
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,600
You gave birth to a lot in that good environment

754
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,200
many children died

755
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,200
So the result is instead to say

756
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,800
This is to analyze dead data directly

757
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
better environment

758
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,200
Because everyone lives more

759
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,400
In fact, more children die

760
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,600
In a bad environment, fewer children die

761
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,000
what about this

762
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,400
It is actually a very common occurrence in social life.

763
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,000
This is called a public tragedy

764
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
you just want to say

765
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,200
Because it is a shared dynasty

766
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,800
So if the weather is nice

767
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,000
Everyone is in good health

768
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So everyone will fight

769
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Then you have the energy to raise more eggs

770
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The result is that you actually have more children than you can have

771
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
because you're going to compete with you

772
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
If you don't give birth to so many others will give birth to more

773
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
In fact, this is where we can use game theory to analyze

774
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It shows that this public tragedy actually happened on Guan Yu

775
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Then the best way to prevent it is to say

776
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Because when the environment is bad, you have to cooperate

777
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Of course everyone is interested

778
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I wrote a popular science article on Science Paper

779
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Well, a very important takeaway from this part is that

780
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It is the totality of the same boat just mentioned.

781
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Then I will explain in detail later why this is in the same boat

782
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Then let me show you a video

783
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's another creature that's actually a lobster.

784
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,860
Sometimes a plan in cooperation with others

785
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,860
Then why is it related to lobster? Let's take a look

786
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,700
Well, the lobster example is quite interesting, that is,

787
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,800
Wait a moment

788
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,760
This lobster generally lives in relatively shallow seas.

789
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,200
but

790
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,200
It has a very special behavior when there is a typhoon

791
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
Or when America called the gale

792
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,600
where are these lobsters

793
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,700
It must be taken to a relatively deep sea to cover the typhoon

794
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
So the ecological environment here is the typhoon

795
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
or the wind

796
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
The cool thing about that is when the lobster is pulling

797
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,700
it will form a group

798
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,700
These individuals don't usually live together.

799
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,700
no interaction

800
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But like this play

801
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
they will

802
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's just that the line is getting longer and longer

803
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Great Wall

804
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
also like this

805
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
such as this line

806
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Well enough

807
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
on the first

808
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
also like this

809
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
that everyone knows

810
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
it's still together

811
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
also like this

812
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
first comparison

813
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
that's because

814
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
all

815
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,020
as many as five to ten times

816
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:31,020
Okay, so the phenomenon we're going to study is this

817
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,020
Of course it wasn't me. It was our co-author.

818
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,020
He's an expert on lobsters

819
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,020
And I think the coolest part of his research is to say

820
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,020
I just said that before the migration of lobsters

821
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,020
he actually gets together

822
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
and then keep going in circles

823
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:52,020
So he's going to study this lobster migration

824
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
every time there is a typhoon warning

825
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,020
He quickly went into the sea to observe how this lobster migrates

826
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
that's fun

827
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,600
This place is the lobster lead.

828
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,100
It will go around in circles. The video just now also talked about

829
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,000
That is to say, it will actually last for varying lengths of time.

830
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that is

831
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,600
just turn around and then

832
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,100
when one decides to be the leader

833
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,000
Because leadership is the hardest

834
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Then other people will follow it like this

835
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
what are we going to study

836
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,200
That is to say, in fact, this is what we use models to study

837
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,000
Just use game theory to study

838
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,400
What about this large school or small school of lobsters?

839
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,800
You can think about it, that is, if a group of lobsters

840
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
There's someone who's going to be the leader

841
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,300
they don't know each other

842
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,800
Then what

843
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,300
It means being the leader is the one who runs first

844
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,800
or the most tired

845
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
So, our research question is

846
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Is it a large school of lobsters or a small school of lobsters?

847
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,200
It will be quicker for someone to come forward

848
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,800
to be the leader

849
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,300
Then everyone can go

850
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,500
Then think about it, don't you?

851
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,400
Do you think the large group will go first?

852
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
please raise your hand

853
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,100
good

854
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,260
That's definitely the small group that will go first.

855
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Please raise your hand

856
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
wow good

857
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,140
Okay guys, does anyone want to explain why?

858
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,260
Faster and better coordinated

859
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,040
It's that small groups may be easier to coordinate

860
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,140
Just leave as soon as you need to, right?

861
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,440
ok but i just said something

862
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,640
In fact, he doesn't know these people at all.

863
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,440
It's because their lobsters don't usually form groups

864
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,640
It's when the typhoon comes that we gather together quickly

865
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,640
They don't usually live together

866
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,640
Why are there large groups and small groups?

867
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,040
when he gets together

868
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,440
In fact, when they gather

869
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,740
Sometimes there will be more only together

870
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,840
sometimes less

871
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,440
Of course you can talk about why you took that route

872
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,940
Then someone may study that

873
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,440
Maybe with that they can use the magnetic ones to guide

874
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,940
just where to go

875
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,940
Um

876
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Well, actually, of course we do this using patterns.

877
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
That is to say, there are actual data

878
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,100
The result is that you can actually see the time

879
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,900
You can imagine that this 1 is a typhoon coming

880
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,900
Then it’s over if Da Luo doesn’t start, the time to start provisionally

881
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Then this n is the group size

882
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,600
Then this probability is the probability of who will become a leader

883
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
Then this can be converted into time

884
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
That means actually

885
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,600
In January, of course you will leave immediately

886
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,200
you go when you need to go

887
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,300
Then you can see that the ordered thing is to say

888
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,000
What if there are two

889
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Actually it takes a long time

890
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,300
someone will become a leader

891
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,100
What about early January?

892
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,900
The closer the typhoon comes

893
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,700
someone will be the leader

894
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,800
That is to say, when there are actually more people

895
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,600
He will actually drag on longer

896
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,200
That's the actual data

897
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,400
that looks like only five dots

898
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,600
In fact, at that time because he received it a long time ago

899
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,000
so

900
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,960
In fact, he received more than 30 points

901
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,600
just useless to analyze well

902
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,400
But basically when the group gets bigger

903
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,400
In fact, the time he spent waiting

904
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,000
In fact, the longer you wait

905
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,200
Well, this can actually be said to everyone

906
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,400
wait a minute i have

907
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,000
In fact, when the group is larger, it is

908
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,500
you can see that is to say

909
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,400
No one is willing to come out to lead

910
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,800
Well, if some of you can't get sociology

911
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,600
it was said a long time ago

912
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Then say to the social college

913
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,000
Just like our sociology, people also have this kind of

914
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,100
They call it shared responsibility

915
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,600
The most famous example is a man in New York

916
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,900
Then they were chopped

917
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,200
Then I don't know dozens of people saw it

918
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,800
Then no one rescued him like this

919
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
It was later proven that the story seemed untrue.

920
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,300
But in short

921
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,800
when more people

922
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,600
no one wants to come out

923
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,300
take on this public thing

924
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,500
but you look at it from here

925
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,700
Just why would someone come out to bear it?

926
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,900
Taking Long Xia as an example

927
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900
As you can imagine, it is very intuitive to say

928
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,700
In fact, there can never be no one

929
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,000
because of you

930
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Someone has to go

931
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,400
So the situation is that

932
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,900
In fact, there is a lot of pressure

933
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,800
Just need someone to do this cooperation

934
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,500
So the summary is that

935
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,100
Whether it's just infused or not

936
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,200
Or the lobster example just mentioned

937
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,300
a principle that i think is very important

938
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,800
It is the same boat in the same boat mentioned in Sun Tzu's Art of War

939
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,500
That togetherness is actually behind it

940
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
has a deep meaning

941
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,800
Then I'll read it for everyone

942
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,500
He said this is nothing

943
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,300
more people are wrong

944
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,300
When they are in the same boat and they want the wind

945
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,700
It looks as old as left and right

946
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Then it means

947
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,000
If you have read history

948
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,700
That is to say, no country follows the country of Yue

949
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,900
It's an enemy country, right?

950
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,200
This Wuwang Fucha Yuewang Goujian is like this

951
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,700
They are actually enemies

952
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,300
That is to say if they

953
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,300
When a boat is about to cross the river

954
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,800
hit this storm

955
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,100
then everyone will help each other

956
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,600
like the left hand helps the right hand

957
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,400
What kind of consciousness is this?

958
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,240
so he said this

959
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,640
That is to say, Qiyong has the right way of nihilism

960
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,320
This is of course the most important sentence

961
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,760
He said that those who make good use of soldiers

962
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,840
Hand in hand to implement a last resort

963
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,600
mean to say

964
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,760
His one is Nine Emperors

965
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,240
It's how you use the emperor form to lead troops

966
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,880
that means he said

967
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,600
In fact, you have to invest your soldiers in the dead emperor

968
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,920
Then save the stone emperor and win

969
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,240
Conquer the counties to the public, serve the counties to harm, and then win or lose

970
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,720
mean to say

971
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,680
actually

972
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,080
when your army

973
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,120
An example like this is an example of being beaten by water

974
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,520
That is to say, when your army is in a black river

975
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,120
Everyone has no centripetal force

976
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,120
Then everyone is a teacher

977
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,360
when you don't want to fight

978
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,960
A strategy you can use is to say

979
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,840
actually

980
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,160
let everyone be

981
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,200
To a

982
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,880
very dangerous environment

983
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,560
It is you who make good use of this ecological environment

984
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,840
make everyone very dangerous

985
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,200
Then what

986
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,520
just if you

987
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,120
If you for example say you want to flee without a fight

988
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
you have nowhere to go

989
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,160
That's the so-called dead emperor

990
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,200
If there is reality, then at this time, there is nothing you can do

991
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,000
We had no choice but to work very hard, that is, to cooperate to kill the enemy

992
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,700
What about this, what about the lobster we just talked about about Yiyi Huamei?

993
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,100
what does it matter? actually i think it means

994
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,000
The cooperation of many creatures is like this particle

995
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,100
That is to say, it is like a plum blossom, but it is actually there, and it cooperates

996
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,200
The reason why it is very cooperative is that, in fact, there is no way for you not to cooperate

997
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,200
Because, for example, the environment is too bad

998
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,600
So you don't have the energy to peel raw eggs and fight

999
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,300
The lobster particles mean that if everyone is not together

1000
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,000
That is to say, if no one leaves

1001
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,400
That would actually become

1002
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,000
just like this, everybody dies

1003
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,800
So you're saying you're being forced to cooperate

1004
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,000
ok that's the first part

1005
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,600
Then, I seem to want to speak a little faster

1006
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,700
The second part is that we're going to talk about burial bugs.

1007
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Then of course why does the burial bug talk about this?

1008
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,200
just wait a minute

1009
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,200
Actually, I think this burial bug study

1010
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,700
with this we humans

1011
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
Expansion history has a lot to do with

1012
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,240
people actually

1013
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,800
This is what an ecologist from EOL province said

1014
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,400
He said that in fact, people and ants are the same

1015
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,800
The two most successful species on this planet

1016
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
Humans are the most successful animals

1017
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,600
is the most biomass

1018
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,400
And the ants are the most in the five-year-old

1019
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,800
Well if you look at our own natural history

1020
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,800
It's been debated for years, of course.

1021
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,800
But for example, from 60,000 to 100,000 years

1022
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,600
We expand from this Africa to the whole planet

1023
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
In fact, in a very short time

1024
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,000
We have been very successful in expanding to a large area

1025
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,200
from an ecological point of view

1026
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,000
The question to think about is to say

1027
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,200
In fact, if we are in the environment of Africa

1028
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,000
how to adapt

1029
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,600
slowly in a short time

1030
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,200
Adapt to environments from this arctic to the equator

1031
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,400
Of course one of the important roles

1032
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,760
That is to say, the so-called social conquest

1033
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,900
He thinks it's because

1034
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,360
People form social groups

1035
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,560
So we have developed a lot of capabilities

1036
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,060
but

1037
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,400
Of course it's because of people you can't do experiments

1038
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,860
it's hard for you to prove that

1039
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,860
It's because of cooperation

1040
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,460
Then of course there is other circumstantial evidence

1041
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,460
For example, these changes in brain volume

1042
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,060
but i think that means

1043
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,060
You need to understand the fundamental problem of human expansion

1044
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,820
In fact, you have to study and say this

1045
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,820
The relationship between environment and social behavior evolution

1046
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,420
So actually?

1047
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,920
Of course, it is from why people wait a while to jump to

1048
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,720
On this little bug

1049
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,720
Because we can experiment

1050
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Then in fact in the current theory

1051
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,220
just to explain

1052
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,020
Why do organisms form social groups

1053
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,620
There are two main categories

1054
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,520
Ecological Limit Hypotheses

1055
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,020
That's actually talking about a good ecological environment.

1056
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,020
my middle school face

1057
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,260
density becomes high

1058
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,820
then this time

1059
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,140
In fact, the competitive pressure in this society is very strong.

1060
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,260
So this time

1061
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,660
Cooperation is actually to counteract the pressure of competition within this species

1062
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,300
It's in the species

1063
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,600
then you can imagine

1064
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,860
I think you may be very familiar with this concept

1065
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,700
it's actually like this

1066
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,860
The current situation in Taiwan

1067
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,260
Everyone fits this example

1068
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,360
That is to say, our population density is very high.

1069
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,200
so this

1070
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,260
What I want to say here is to say

1071
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,120
Here is the bio example

1072
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,120
this is the year

1073
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,920
This is the density of the group

1074
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,120
Then what

1075
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,720
This was originally a military purpose

1076
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,760
This sex is on the small island of Saixi

1077
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,920
It has been this for several years

1078
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,020
This is the number of fields

1079
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,260
This is the number of groups

1080
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,960
It is when the group grows to a certain level

1081
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,360
cooperation begins

1082
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,560
It is here that the cooperative group is formed

1083
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,220
that's because it's

1084
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,680
You can see that the number of trips has actually not increased

1085
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,240
that just said

1086
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,400
Why is it very similar to the example of Taiwan?

1087
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,600
That is, as you can imagine, it is the area of ​​the island we fixed.

1088
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,100
That's because more and more people

1089
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,500
So basically this can be done with grass

1090
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,700
Then we may just buy a house

1091
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,600
It's getting harder and harder at this price

1092
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,000
The price is getting higher and higher

1093
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,400
So more and more like this bird

1094
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,300
We call it offspring delayed dialing

1095
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,200
In Chinese, it is called Ken Laozu

1096
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,800
That is to say, children can't

1097
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,200
Go outside on your own, for example, to build a house or start a family

1098
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,300
So these creatures are actually when the density is very high

1099
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,200
He really doesn't have enough ability to go

1100
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,300
go build a field yourself

1101
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,800
So he stayed home and helped

1102
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,800
Then this is in the bird

1103
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
There is a lot of evidence to show that

1104
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,400
In fact, many birds are

1105
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,600
The relationship between species competitive pressure

1106
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,100
So in a good environment

1107
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,000
Because of the high level of competition

1108
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,900
That's good for the environment, but the competition in the social environment is high

1109
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,240
That's why this cooperative group was formed.

1110
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,540
But recently there was another

1111
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,940
One type of study found that

1112
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,640
In fact, the changing environment

1113
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,880
On the contrary, many social groups emerged

1114
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,640
The reason is because of the changing environment

1115
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,800
For example, in Africa, the rainfall is very stable and varies greatly.

1116
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,100
That actually needs everyone's help

1117
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,940
for children in times of drought

1118
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,600
The example of people is actually very famous, that is,

1119
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,340
這個It takes a village to raise a child

1120
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,340
i.e. need a tribe

1121
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,940
Let's help together to take care of and raise a child

1122
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,640
Well, that's actually another category.

1123
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,240
There are mainly two arguments

1124
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,100
There are actually some suitable examples for each of them.

1125
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,940
So it is actually a good environment

1126
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,000
also promote social groups

1127
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,640
An unfavorable environment actually promotes the formation of social groups

1128
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,200
So, in fact, this research is relatively more

1129
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,700
It is how the chaotic environment affects the evolution of this society

1130
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,000
but what about us

1131
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,320
Wait a minute for this example

1132
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,400
That is to say, very few people actually ask

1133
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,560
If the ecological environment promotes the evolution of society

1134
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,320
How does that affect the species or group

1135
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,600
That's what I just said

1136
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,120
In fact, from a human point of view

1137
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,200
In fact, it means that after we form a social basis

1138
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,360
With this we can expand so fast

1139
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,960
does it matter

1140
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,800
That's my theory

1141
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,400
But to put it simply, you don't need to look at that picture

1142
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,000
that means

1143
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,800
If you form a social cycle

1144
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
For example, like Taiwan

1145
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,800
is to combat the pressure of species

1146
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,000
Its premise is that the density of the ethnic group is already very high.

1147
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,500
Therefore, at this time, a social bottom line is formed.

1148
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,100
won't help the group

1149
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,200
That is, it can be denser

1150
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,100
or expand to a wider range

1151
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,800
That's another category

1152
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,300
If we form a social cycle

1153
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,000
is to resist the harsh environment

1154
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,200
ecological environment words

1155
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,100
In fact, at this time, a social cycle is formed.

1156
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,700
should be able to help you

1157
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,100
is to expand to expand

1158
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,260
to a wider area

1159
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,820
Then we are going to be the subject of this experiment

1160
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,260
This is the dirty bug bought in Nepal

1161
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,560
In fact, you can also think about it

1162
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,760
If you can ignore moral issues today

1163
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,560
you go to experiment say

1164
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,760
going to test says

1165
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,900
man can expand so fast

1166
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,260
Does it have anything to do with forming a social group?

1167
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,460
what experiment will you do

1168
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,760
Of course, you may not have this habit

1169
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,760
Then let's live and think about it

1170
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,460
what is the best experiment

1171
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,860
Then with this example, I would say

1172
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,820
Actually if you can

1173
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,520
I say now just assuming there is no moral question

1174
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,260
You can actually say I'm looking for 100 people

1175
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:39,660
then one pair

1176
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,820
One male and one female can reproduce like this

1177
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,560
then you force them

1178
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,320
Just one pair

1179
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,820
You send him to that equator to the North Pole

1180
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:50,160
various places

1181
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,060
This is where humans are now expanding

1182
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,720
You just force them to be a couple like this

1183
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,520
you have an independent society

1184
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,380
the so-called lack of social groups

1185
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:00,080
Solar theory

1186
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
of

1187
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
individual

1188
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Then of course another group of experimental groups

1189
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
you might just say

1190
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Let's say I send 50 people to a place at a time

1191
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
right

1192
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
That is, you can look at these 50 people

1193
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
just in different places

1194
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
his chances of success

1195
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Of course this experiment is on people

1196
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
it's impossible

1197
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
so we can

1198
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
But we can buy chapters in our

1199
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Do something like this from inside

1200
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
that we can force them

1201
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
only one pair

1202
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Let him have many individuals with one follow-up

1203
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and you send him to that

1204
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
different ecological environments

1205
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Specifically

1206
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Of course, before introducing this experiment

1207
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Just to briefly introduce this chapter to everyone.

1208
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
This is actually very common in Taiwan

1209
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
In Nangang here in winter there will be

1210
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
no more now

1211
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
They are, as the name suggests

1212
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
he will use the corpse

1213
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
when he found the body

1214
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
He actually has several

1215
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
he is not a relative either

1216
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Mainly because this corpse is a changing environment

1217
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So when a dead body

1218
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Buy chapters from Wendai and Wendai

1219
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
it will fly from all directions

1220
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
And then they'll put the body together

1221
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
get it in the soil

1222
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Then place an order near this soil

1223
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Then the cool part is to say

1224
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
In fact, they can use their

1225
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
This secreted chemical substance in the body

1226
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
embalming this corpse

1227
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Then give them children to eat after abdominal disintegration

1228
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They also feed the children like this

1229
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So just say that

1230
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
We actually want to understand this

1231
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Cooperative Behavior Social Behavior

1232
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The relationship with his ecological response

1233
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So we will manipulate his group size

1234
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Okay, so the way it works is

1235
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
We just put two and six individuals

1236
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
go into the wild

1237
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Of course the most challenging thing is to say

1238
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
how are you out in the wild

1239
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
is to control his group size

1240
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Then of course why in the wild?

1241
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Because of his ecological challenges

1242
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
The main thing is that he competes with flies

1243
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
when you have a dead body

1244
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Flies will come and take this soon

1245
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,900
So what they are fighting against is you have to bury these corpses in the soil very quickly

1246
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,400
That way the flies can't use it

1247
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,400
Our different ecological gadgets are that we can

1248
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,400
In the east-west section of neutralization we can follow the elevation

1249
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,100
Then of course this is the Meifeng Farm that I just mentioned

1250
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,400
this is where we live

1251
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:27,800
So we can quickly go from very low to high to do research

1252
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,200
Like here, the altitude may be about 1,000 or so

1253
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,200
We can always do fast three thousand

1254
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,000
So you can have different this environment

1255
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,700
And of course we also need a lot of people to do field experiments

1256
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,100
Then its biggest competitors for decomposing corpses are flies

1257
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,500
sorry that's not very clear

1258
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,900
That is to say, it is actually quite intuitive, that is, the hotter the fly is, the more competitive it is.

1259
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,700
The reason is that flies can fly very quickly

1260
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,600
The children of flies tend to decompose the corpse very quickly

1261
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,260
This experiment is only difficult in one place

1262
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,440
that means you're going to be out in the wild

1263
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,540
Let the burying bug have no way to get in and out

1264
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,200
So when we put two in and six in

1265
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,960
it can sustain this expenditure

1266
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,040
But there must be a way to eat and drink freely

1267
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,700
compete with burial bugs

1268
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,440
This is the most difficult part of designing this experiment.

1269
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,040
my research statement

1270
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,600
It took him a month

1271
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,100
Suitable for dozens of combinations

1272
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,900
finally developed a method

1273
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,900
That means we use burial bugs and catering

1274
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,800
The ability to fly is different

1275
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,300
So we made another Wuyan

1276
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,000
Then this is like this

1277
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,400
just use that head video

1278
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,300
Then stick a long black rock

1279
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,400
with a short black rock

1280
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,500
means to make a channel

1281
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,800
It's the burial bug because it's bigger

1282
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
It can fly without food

1283
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,300
So you design a channel for something hard to fly

1284
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,700
Let only catering can fly in

1285
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,680
Mahjong Bug, we want to paint all over the top of this head video

1286
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,840
Just let it go up and it will slide, so there is no way to climb forward

1287
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:16,280
So the key to use is that you have to be very careful to paint this decorative forest evenly.

1288
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,080
The bug is also very powerful, and sometimes it will make mistakes, that is, if it is not painted well, it will go in.

1289
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,080
It looks like this

1290
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,960
Of course, the result is that we can actually guess successfully.

1291
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,760
Let's talk about the size of the worm group. This large group is about 5

1292
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,920
It’s just that there will be less. If it doesn’t like it, we have designed a channel so that it can fly away.

1293
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,920
But if there are two, occasionally there will still be very powerful insects outside that can come in.

1294
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,920
But it's close to two so we can create this big group and small group we just talked about

1295
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,920
Then you put along the altitude

1296
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,920
You can see the impact of cooperation and this in different environments

1297
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,920
Then you can see the result, of course if you don't see it very clearly

1298
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,920
It means that the reproduction is successful. This is also the altitude.

1299
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
This is temperature, this is reproductive success

1300
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Then the blue line is a pair of individuals

1301
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I just talked about two

1302
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
The orange ones are the ones who just talked about this large group.

1303
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
The one most important result is here

1304
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That is to say, in fact, large groups of individuals

1305
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Success Rates at Low Altitudes

1306
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
is significantly higher than that of the two small groups

1307
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
In that case, if you convert it into temperature, it means

1308
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
In places where the temperature is high, the burial must cooperate.

1309
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
The chances of success will be much higher

1310
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So in fact the result is that

1311
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
In fact, the group is the scope of its distribution

1312
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Having enough range with them to breed is a big help

1313
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
In addition, it is because just now

1314
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
we want to record

1315
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
so we can quantify them

1316
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
just above the altitude

1317
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Conflicts with different temperatures

1318
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Well, the burial place is actually the place with the best environment.

1319
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's a middle altitude place

1320
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
they spend the most time fighting

1321
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Just put a lot of effort into fighting

1322
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Then what

1323
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,600
As for the investment, this is a video of their fight

1324
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,400
Of course, this was recorded in a laboratory, so it's a bit cleaner

1325
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:11,520
I can't seem to let it go

1326
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,380
It's ok, just fighting is what they bite

1327
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,720
Then, in addition, we can look at his investment

1328
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,780
That is to say, in fact, he took the time to talk about

1329
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,840
Disposing of corpses, embalming, etc.

1330
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,160
In fact, it was also at the time when the lowest Haiba was the lowest, and this group

1331
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,020
The orange one is a group, the blue one is two, and this one is six

1332
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,840
In fact, the lower the sea, the hotter the place

1333
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,660
In fact, the group will spend more time

1334
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,700
Let's dispose of this corpse together

1335
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,780
So the result is

1336
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,620
It can be seen that he actually

1337
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,160
It's interesting to say

1338
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,440
two

1339
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:57,340
In fact, his success rate is higher in the middle Haiba, and for the six, his success rate is higher in the lower Haiba

1340
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,340
That's actually because of this

1341
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,500
Large groups can cooperate

1342
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,300
Then drive the flies away at lower altitudes

1343
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,000
That's why this result

1344
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,300
good

1345
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,100
What's more, it's for

1346
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,700
Because we mainly do it at altitude

1347
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,100
So that's because of the experiment

1348
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,300
It's just that you want to make it clear

1349
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,300
Is it the effect of temperature?

1350
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,800
So our assistant designed a heating plate

1351
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,200
when in the wild

1352
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,300
That's a concrete resistor

1353
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,500
Then we can put this body in this

1354
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,600
above the heating plate

1355
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,600
so you can

1356
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,100
For example, at mid-altitude to heat a corpse

1357
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,700
and see if it's this

1358
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,300
It's really the temperature that affects their cooperative behavior.

1359
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,500
what about this

1360
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,600
This is heating and this is control

1361
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,400
that does mean

1362
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,500
The orange ones are large groups

1363
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,700
The blue ones are small groups

1364
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,700
just said

1365
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,300
In fact, when doing this at mid-altitude

1366
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:56,200
The reproductive success of two is actually higher than that of six

1367
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,600
but what about after you heat

1368
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,000
In fact, the success of six is ​​higher than that of two.

1369
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,560
Then his investment is also heated

1370
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,200
His investment is more than control is a large group of words

1371
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,800
It is more investment

1372
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,400
That's another, more experimental proof that

1373
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,600
In fact, it is the effect of temperature

1374
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,600
to influence his cooperative behavior

1375
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,800
So let's sum up that

1376
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
In fact, you take this picture to mean

1377
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,600
The size and size of the fly represent the stress of the fly

1378
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,800
The hotter the place, the higher the pressure of the fly

1379
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,800
then buried as if you were two individuals

1380
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,800
In fact, we have information

1381
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,400
I'm just drawing pictures for everyone to see now

1382
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,000
That is to say, he can only be in a warmer place

1383
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,200
reproductive success

1384
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
but through cooperation

1385
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,400
He can actually breed it successfully in this range

1386
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,400
expanded

1387
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,000
So this you can see is that

1388
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,400
In this example, it means

1389
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,400
Cooperation can actually promote the expansion of his ecological niche

1390
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,200
Then it's Mandarin and it's time to visit

1391
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,200
there is a picture

1392
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,880
That is to say, everyone is in a very fun environment at middle altitudes.

1393
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,400
Everyone fights hard

1394
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,280
But the low altitude because there are a lot of flies

1395
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,280
So everyone will work hard together to dispose of the corpse.

1396
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,840
Then we contributed at that time

1397
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,160
A very interesting editor used this Social Insight and Climate Change

1398
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,440
The difference is probably because we have to heat the dead body

1399
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,720
When you can see it is like when it is hotter

1400
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:32,880
In fact, you can see that organisms may become more cooperative in the face of harsh environments

1401
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,880
So I didn’t go back to what I said at the beginning, what does this have to do with people?

1402
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,080
So in fact, let's look at this social behavior of people.

1403
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,440
Does it have anything to do with this extension?

1404
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,800
In fact, I think the most important thing from what I just said is to say

1405
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,280
In fact, what is the reason why people form social types?

1406
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,920
In fact, what we need to know most

1407
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,240
Of course, one of the main theories now is that in fact, there is competition among species.

1408
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,480
That is to say, people are actually between tribes and tribes.

1409
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,480
because of the war

1410
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,480
So if you don't form groups

1411
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,560
Then if someone forms a group you lose it

1412
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,400
so you have to form groups

1413
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,840
The other thing is to cooperate to take care of children.

1414
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,200
Another reason that may be important

1415
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,520
That is to say, in fact, if you want to talk about human children

1416
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,960
In fact, the head is very big

1417
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,720
So I was born when I was helpless

1418
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,160
so many people to take care of it

1419
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,520
Then what I put forward is called the Born of Misfortune Hypothesis

1420
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,400
that is, why is this relevant?

1421
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,600
That is, if this species

1422
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,200
Evolved this cooperative behavior in harsh environments

1423
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,080
to fight against this ecological environment

1424
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,520
bad ecological environment

1425
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,680
Their competitiveness can actually be strengthened through this cooperation

1426
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,040
Well, it's actually at the species level

1427
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,400
It will actually be more competitive

1428
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,360
then we haven't done it yet

1429
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,800
But it's interesting to say

1430
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,280
Because we Nepali burial bugs

1431
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,960
What we found is that it actually

1432
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,480
its cooperative noncooperative behavior

1433
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,160
is entirely affected by the presence or absence of flies

1434
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,840
so but what

1435
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,520
In fact, the history of burial bugs has been studied a lot

1436
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,900
Their evolutionary origin is

1437
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,500
This worm may have had his ancestors in

1438
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,600
Probably China, a place in Mongolia

1439
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,600
The oldest burial bugs evolved over there

1440
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,560
But it's interesting to say that this burial bug we studied

1441
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,560
In fact, it may be in this area

1442
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,560
This is what evolved

1443
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:25,560
Well, but his current distribution range is actually widely distributed in the whole of East Asia.

1444
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,560
The funny thing is you think if he

1445
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,560
If he evolved in a temperate zone

1446
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,760
It might not be that sensitive to flies, actually.

1447
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,760
So far apart from our

1448
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,760
In fact, beyond the study of burial bugs

1449
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,760
Burying bugs haven't seen similar behavior anywhere else.

1450
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,760
So I don't have a hypothesis just to say

1451
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,760
In fact, it can be measured

1452
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,760
that is to say, is this

1453
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,760
Our burial bugs actually evolved after the tropics

1454
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,760
slowly expand back

1455
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,760
it's a colder place

1456
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,760
Because he can actually fight the heat

1457
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,760
He can be in a cold place

1458
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,760
Through cooperation he is

1459
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,760
Species that can adapt to a wide range of ecological environments

1460
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,260
So we can test whether his history is like this

1461
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,920
Back to people, that is to say, in fact

1462
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,240
There are other studies that say

1463
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,300
That's because you can't do it directly

1464
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,360
So let's study and compare different monkeys

1465
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,440
Social monkeys and non-social monkeys

1466
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:21,000
Or the relationship between group size and brain volume

1467
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,320
Then you will usually see that it is actually possible that this brain capacity

1468
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,360
species with larger groups

1469
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,680
The higher the level of society

1470
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,480
Brain capacity may be larger

1471
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,780
That's only circumstantial evidence

1472
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:35,600
The social brand is the head of the society

1473
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,680
So this is also a way to say that you actually face this social challenge

1474
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,720
then let your

1475
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,240
May be stronger

1476
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,320
Then you say that you are born with advantages and disadvantages

1477
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:46,600
so you can

1478
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:50,180
the species or population can become more successful

1479
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,980
what about the end

1480
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,280
Let me introduce you briefly

1481
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,840
I just talked about social species

1482
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,120
Now let's talk about this vertebrate marine animal

1483
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
distributed

1484
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,280
Of course this is my challenge

1485
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,280
The classic theory of ecology actually challenges Darwin's theory

1486
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,280
Probably very difficult, but what we're talking about is

1487
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,280
the theory of ecology the theory of ecology

1488
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,280
What are you mainly talking about? That is, because now

1489
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,280
What about the relationship with global change, so a lot of research

1490
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,280
Try to answer that in fact it is

1491
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,280
The species with high tails are still tropical

1492
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,280
species that are more vulnerable to warming

1493
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Of course, everyone can think about it

1494
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
What do you think is the difference between the temperate zone and the tropical environment?

1495
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Generally speaking, it may be a place with high tail

1496
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Spring, summer, autumn and winter may be very clear, and the temperature in the tropics is very stable.

1497
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So what about ecology?

1498
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
It's just a simple idea that actually

1499
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
this is the species and then what

1500
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
The gray line is the current temperature

1501
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
X is temperature Temperate species

1502
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,940
Because the temperature varies greatly throughout the year

1503
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,900
So everyone thinks

1504
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,900
That is, temperate species can adapt to changes in the seasons of the year

1505
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,600
So it can tolerate the temperature range

1506
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,800
wider than tropical species

1507
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,400
Because the temperature in the tropics is very stable

1508
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,600
So the temperature range they can adapt to is very narrow

1509
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,000
Therefore, in the case of generalization, you increase a few degrees

1510
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,400
No problem for temperate species

1511
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,800
Because it can adapt to this changing temperature environment

1512
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,000
But if a tropical species fits so narrowly

1513
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,200
A few degrees more warming and they're in big trouble

1514
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,900
So now everyone thinks that

1515
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:42,200
In fact, this warming

1516
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,900
Although it may be at a high degree

1517
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,100
The warming of the physical environment is more serious

1518
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,900
That is, the degree of warming will be higher at high altitudes

1519
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,600
temperature will be higher

1520
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,800
But on the contrary, it is the species that everyone thinks is called tropical

1521
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,700
because the temperature is stable

1522
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,000
So it is more affected by warming

1523
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,760
High status is born of sorrow

1524
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,600
because of the constant challenges

1525
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,400
Then this probably died of peace

1526
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,140
Because it is a very stable environment

1527
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,940
So everyone thinks so

1528
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:16,340
But in fact, we are because of the relationship between buying and storing

1529
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:17,780
you start on the hill

1530
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,840
It's the cooler temperature along the altitude

1531
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,440
cold for a long time

1532
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,140
Then you discover that in fact this

1533
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,340
Of course you don't have to be cold

1534
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,680
If you go to that mountain in Taiwan

1535
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,120
you must feel it

1536
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,120
That is to say, this is the month in the mountainous area.

1537
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,080
this is the temperature

1538
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,120
Then you can see that it is the soil of No. 2006

1539
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,380
It is the so-called tropical low altitude that it can

1540
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,580
with tropical mountains

1541
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,480
you see its temperature change

1542
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,380
Let's say it's 15 degrees

1543
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,280
it's 18 degrees

1544
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,420
the possible change is

1545
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,880
Is it just a few degrees?

1546
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,440
two or three degrees

1547
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,980
Then they think this temperate zone is

1548
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:56,980
very big change

1549
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:59,980
It can be -20 degrees to 10 degrees

1550
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,600
It is in line with what I just said, that the tropics are very stable.

1551
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,200
Then the temperate zone changes a lot

1552
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,200
is it true

1553
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,600
This is actually the monthly average

1554
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,900
If you have been to the mountains of Taiwan

1555
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:17,000
You know, that is, the one on the mountain in Taiwan

1556
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,360
For example, you go to summer

1557
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:19,300
to river bend hill

1558
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,800
It was very hot at noon

1559
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,800
And at night it's actually very cold

1560
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,200
It's not them, it's these tropical

1561
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,800
when temperate researchers imagine

1562
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:37,000
In fact, the tropics is a very stable environment

1563
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,300
not like this

1564
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,700
What about the evidence? Like this is actually a piece of evidence.

1565
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,000
That is to say, this is what we measured in Taiwan

1566
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,200
It is Taiwan's high-altitude open land

1567
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,900
In fact, the temperature difference can be very large

1568
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,900
It's 10 degrees at night

1569
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:55,400
Then it can reach 20 degrees at about 12 o'clock in the daytime

1570
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:57,100
10 degrees at night

1571
01:06:57,100 --> 01:07:00,000
Of course, the temperature difference is not so much different at low altitudes.

1572
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
That means that in fact, when everyone was thinking about ecological phenomena,

1573
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,160
In fact, they all focus on the changes in a year

1574
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,360
but no one thinks about saying

1575
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,360
In fact, the change of the day is still a change

1576
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,860
So what exactly is the effect on the species?

1577
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,960
So let's analyze this

1578
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,600
It is this database that has been sorted out by someone.

1579
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,660
It is the range of distribution of these species in the world

1580
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:28,560
Then what about the distribution range in mountainous areas

1581
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,520
So what we found is this

1582
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,160
what everyone thinks

1583
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,920
That is to say, the higher the tail

1584
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,320
The larger the annual temperature difference, the larger the distribution range

1585
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,220
Because it adapts to all seasons

1586
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,120
This is no problem, indeed we have seen it in our analysis

1587
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,120
But the interesting thing is to say

1588
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,420
In fact, we found that the places where the daily temperature difference is greater

1589
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,320
In fact, the distribution range of the species is smaller

1590
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,020
That is to say, on the contrary, this time is a very bad environment.

1591
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,520
It's a place with a big temperature difference

1592
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,880
On the contrary, the distribution range of your species is very small

1593
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,400
This is something no one has ever seen before

1594
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,600
Of course we are the same

1595
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:11,000
That is, we made a mathematical model to explain

1596
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,500
Why is the long-term temperature difference different from the short-term temperature difference?

1597
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,900
have the opposite effect

1598
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:19,200
That is mainly a relatively simple idea that

1599
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,700
If the seasons change throughout the year

1600
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,200
Actually you can't escape

1601
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,300
You must live all year round

1602
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,300
But if it is a short-term change

1603
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,100
In fact, it is more efficient

1604
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,100
Changes in such a short time

1605
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:37,300
Instead, you can choose the most suitable temperature for breeding

1606
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,600
So look at the pattern

1607
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,100
If you only look at the survival of the species there is no way to explain it

1608
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,100
It's you who want to live through the four seasons of the year

1609
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,000
You have to live through this day and night

1610
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,300
But what about breeding?

1611
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,100
In fact, you can compare specialized

1612
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,900
just to act like a short time

1613
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,700
You just breed in a more suitable environment.

1614
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,700
so what

1615
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,020
This instead means that deciding this is a matter of being born in peace and happiness.

1616
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,860
That is to say, it is a better environment

1617
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:08,900
The scope of its divisions can actually be wider

1618
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,700
So in this case it is not necessarily

1619
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:16,260
What everyone generally thinks is that this person is born in good times and dies in peace.

1620
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,860
On the contrary, it is necessary to have a good environment because the difference is relatively small

1621
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,220
Then this very important explanation is that

1622
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:26,460
In fact, in addition to watching the survival of a species, you also have to watch its reproduction

1623
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,060
then this is this

1624
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,060
In fact, this sentence is very reasonable

1625
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,900
The meaning of life is to create the life of the universe Jixi

1626
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,300
Probably the most sensible sentence he ever said

1627
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:38,380
Then what

1628
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:39,940
So you can think of saying

1629
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,180
When the temperature difference is short

1630
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,900
you're like actually we can imagine that is to say

1631
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,060
diurnal animals, nocturnal animals

1632
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,460
diurnal, nocturnal

1633
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,780
you are more focused on this

1634
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,140
But when the annual temperature difference is large

1635
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:52,340
In fact, you may just want to

1636
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:55,980
That is, if you survive, you can survive as long as you want

1637
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,980
Then we use a more careful mathematical model to prove that

1638
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,820
Let's go back to what everyone cares about

1639
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,620
the impact of climate change on organisms

1640
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,460
Then this is born from optimized use, right?

1641
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,520
In fact, we think it's only half true.

1642
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,340
It might be like this when you go to see survival

1643
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,900
So what everyone ignores is that

1644
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,160
Just to see that the annual temperature difference is small

1645
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,740
There's nothing wrong with the tropics being in danger

1646
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:22,780
But places with large diurnal temperature differences

1647
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:23,820
this green place

1648
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,140
These green places all over the world are places with large diurnal temperature differences

1649
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,600
On the contrary, it is now on the conservation

1650
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,100
It's that people don't pay attention

1651
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,140
that of course means

1652
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,600
What about our so-called challenge to this classical theory of ecology?

1653
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,600
Then even if it is published on Science

1654
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,840
Then I said the reason for Yuku Wule

1655
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:47,500
This article means that Science has found an expert in our field

1656
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,740
introduce our articles

1657
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,140
then you look at its title

1658
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,400
Sano Travel in the Tropics

1659
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,460
still talk

1660
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,960
The tropics are the most vulnerable to warming so

1661
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Basically, he didn't understand what we were writing

1662
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
He still does what he thinks, that's our biggest breakthrough

1663
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
As a result, it was not written in his title

1664
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But no way, that's the way science is

1665
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Then, let's go back to the summary, that is, the examples are finished.

1666
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
That is, everyone, I think that in my research

1667
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I think it's the most worthwhile place

1668
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That is to say, whether the environment is good or bad depends on its competitiveness

1669
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Whether it's the competitiveness of individuals, the competitiveness of species

1670
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Or what is the relationship between the competitiveness of the group

1671
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So, in other words, you can imagine

1672
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It must be, that is the flowers we are talking about

1673
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Seems like a negative word, right?

1674
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
The flowers in Wen's must be bad

1675
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
That's my one, just what I wanted to say

1676
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
In fact, if you think intuitively

1677
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Like this example, this is what I took yesterday, and this is what I took today

1678
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Then, we have a pot of this potted plant on my balcony

1679
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
The balcony outside the big company is amazing

1680
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,120
I haven't watered for a long time

1681
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:02,660
then these

1682
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,120
this is in front of my desk

1683
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,400
I water like this every day

1684
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,000
Other activities will be very good

1685
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,360
In fact, life is also quite powerful.

1686
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,360
just give him some water

1687
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,000
it will get better soon

1688
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,760
So in fact, for most of life

1689
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,960
actually good environment

1690
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,000
Actually it would have made it better

1691
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,460
right

1692
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,160
that is

1693
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,320
But I find it interesting to say

1694
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,720
when is the best time

1695
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,000
to species

1696
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,520
For example, an individual or a species or a group

1697
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,200
is better

1698
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,800
when is bad environment

1699
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,400
On the contrary, it is better

1700
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,900
Then I think this problem is actually very

1701
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,600
very common

1702
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,000
Every aspect of our daily life

1703
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,400
In fact, I have always encountered the same problem

1704
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,500
that looks like

1705
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,300
because i have two kids now

1706
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,300
So I often think about this question

1707
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,800
That is to say, things like education

1708
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,800
that is

1709
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,300
you want

1710
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,300
like someone said

1711
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,700
you have more money

1712
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,300
You want to let the children live

1713
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,200
Of course, a lot of it is just experience.

1714
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,900
not really poor

1715
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,000
But there are also studies

1716
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,300
The second is American studies

1717
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,000
That is to say, in fact, in the United States today

1718
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,200
In fact, rich people's homes

1719
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,700
is a very big advantage

1720
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:12,600
Or families with higher social status

1721
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,700
is more resources

1722
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:17,700
And now it's getting harder and harder to turn over

1723
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,300
So the environment is good or bad

1724
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:23,200
with the impact of this education

1725
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,400
I find it interesting to say

1726
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,600
In this example

1727
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
He said a very important reason for poor children

1728
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,400
That is to say, it is actually an example of him fighting hard.

1729
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,200
just hard work

1730
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,300
then they go and say

1731
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,700
In fact, these places are very poor because of the poor material conditions.

1732
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,700
So the kid over there is actually

1733
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:41,000
in a poor material condition

1734
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,600
Instead, it becomes very cooperative

1735
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,500
So of course it's very similar to what we see

1736
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,600
That is to say, in fact, if you want to train children

1737
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,700
If you are good at cooperating with others

1738
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,200
Probably because you can't let him have everything.

1739
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,600
There is no need to cooperate with others

1740
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,200
But that doesn't mean

1741
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,100
In fact, it is not good

1742
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
This environment is always good

1743
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
In fact, I think this example happens very often in Taiwanese society.

1744
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
ok wait a minute

1745
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
What about the other thing about global warming?

1746
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I think it's very relevant to our lobster example

1747
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That is to say, there are actually many elders here.

1748
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
like i feel

1749
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
When we were in college, I was in the guidance agency

1750
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
At that time you talked about global warming

1751
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It seems that not many people care

1752
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
and then at the government level or

1753
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
In fact, there are not many people who put in real effort to do it at a higher level

1754
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Then I think it's like this lobster example

1755
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
It is actually to let everyone do this public thing

1756
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
That was, of course, the meeting in Paris last year.

1757
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Let's say we sign an agreement

1758
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
How much do you want to reduce carbon?

1759
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
is that finally there might be something more concrete

1760
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Then the U.S. may finally join in on this

1761
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Then I think the most obvious reason

1762
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
That is to say, you can actually imagine

1763
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Humans on earth are a very large group

1764
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,840
Internet chatting is something that, for example, 7 billion people have to face

1765
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,000
So in this theory

1766
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,440
The theory of the lobster just now is when Qun Yue was old

1767
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,000
In fact, before the near destruction

1768
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,800
just no one will act

1769
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,360
so the most important therefore is what

1770
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,680
Just to let everyone know how close you are to destruction

1771
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,760
everyone hurry up

1772
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,300
you know it won't work

1773
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,840
So this is actually

1774
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,900
So I say this very common example

1775
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:28,920
that is

1776
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,980
In fact, in a very bad time

1777
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,780
People will try their best to solve it

1778
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,360
Of course, whether this matter can be resolved

1779
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,620
don't know yet

1780
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:41,220
where the hell did we get up

1781
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,020
Then additionally in the section of national competitiveness

1782
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:46,320
I actually like reading history.

1783
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,120
It's actually, of course it's just

1784
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,660
it's just small talk

1785
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:53,240
That is to say, in fact, you can see that there are many examples of

1786
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,780
is a country

1787
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,340
under great pressure

1788
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,860
it starts with

1789
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,700
Like the state of Qin in the Warring States Period

1790
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,400
In fact, the reason for his change of law is that he is about to fail.

1791
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,400
Everyone is going to attack him

1792
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,000
So he started with this Shang Yang Reform

1793
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
So he changed it very well like this

1794
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,200
And then there's this selfish individual

1795
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:23,000
There is no way to be more selfish than

1796
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,900
because the ship is sinking

1797
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,400
like that this

1798
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,600
I just saw this dragon horse type recently

1799
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,000
Japan during the Meiji Restoration

1800
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
they are the same

1801
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
At that time, there was a strong foreign country

1802
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
The black ship is outside to let them open the port

1803
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So the shogunate at that time

1804
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,200
It's finally gone

1805
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,400
So they reformed very well afterwards

1806
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,400
So it became very powerful

1807
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,600
That of course means

1808
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,400
I think it's worth thinking about

1809
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,600
Why is Taiwan okay today

1810
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,600
seems to be very

1811
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
fight very hard

1812
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I think it's an interesting question

1813
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Of course I hope that means

1814
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
like this speech

1815
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Just like what Lao Tzu said

1816
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Good and bad are actually related to each other

1817
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Maybe one day we will experience this

1818
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
And then in the end I want to conclude by saying that

1819
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Actually, I think studying this creature

1820
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
various social creatures in particular

1821
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Actually it's like maybe there are biology students here

1822
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
In fact, we study the behavior of animals

1823
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
partnership with them

1824
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
or ecological adaptation

1825
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
In fact, as we say, for example

1826
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
medical research

1827
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
In fact, you are mainly an experimental subject.

1828
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
not human

1829
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
maybe a mouse

1830
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
filial mother

1831
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Probably Ecolyte like this

1832
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
The main reason is that

1833
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Do we actually have a common evolutionary origin?

1834
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
so many things

1835
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
In fact, the mechanism is common

1836
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
In terms of animal behavior

1837
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
In fact, we can see that

1838
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
We see all sorts of things that could be thieves

1839
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,160
Strategies shaped for different environments

1840
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,160
So actually we look at different species

1841
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,160
we can learn many different

1842
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,160
their way of coping with environmental stress

1843
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:14,960
Finally, I would like to thank the members of my laboratory

1844
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,960
and my collaborators

1845
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,960
thank you all

1846
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,600
Thank you so much for this very good presentation

1847
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,760
insight into

1848
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,760
There's a lot of philosophy in it

1849
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:35,000
so we can come and ask him a lot of things

1850
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
We are open to your questions

1851
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Is there any problem

1852
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
come on behind this

1853
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
please

1854
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Hello, teacher

1855
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,500
The slideshow you're doing now just explained it

1856
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,000
That's what you use to defend

1857
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Why from simple biological behavior

1858
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Observed Social Barrage

1859
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Human social behavior will be explained so frequently by everyone

1860
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
or trying to explain human social behavior

1861
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,120
Then if we adopt your defense

1862
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,520
Then the question I want to ask is

1863
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:07,520
how do we know what to say

1864
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,000
It is acceptable to use Social Barology

1865
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,280
not over explaining

1866
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,720
Without overexaggerating human behavior

1867
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,520
When did we cross this boundary

1868
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
already too over

1869
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,800
It has even become the previous Social Dollar

1870
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,400
exactly the same situation

1871
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,200
how do we tell ourselves

1872
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,240
this is usable

1873
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,920
How should we correctly understand Social Barology

1874
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,920
Thanks

1875
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,200
thanks for the question

1876
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,680
This obviously has a lot to do with the history of our discipline

1877
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:37,320
have a little understanding

1878
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,200
Actually, I think this problem

1879
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:44,600
Just like my teacher in America

1880
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,880
he is studying that

1881
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,720
Just came up with the ecological limit hypothesis

1882
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,960
Then it's interesting that

1883
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,480
He researched that this Lihou rich in Kenya

1884
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,800
Then he studied things

1885
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,800
In fact, the closed household will have foster parents

1886
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,600
when one of the parents dies

1887
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
what happens to children

1888
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,200
He actually saw this in the biology

1889
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,400
Then he discovered that the interesting thing to say is to say

1890
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
that is, if there are foster parents

1891
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,400
small children because they will have children together

1892
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,000
kids will have kids next door

1893
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:27,000
There are often situations where the parents are kicked out by the foster parents.

1894
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Which means he actually saw it on the creature

1895
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
In fact, there may be times when this kind of step family

1896
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
can increase family conflict

1897
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
What you said about this is actually something that I think a friend in the United States went to

1898
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
That is to say, after he discovered this example, he went to the seminar to give a lecture

1899
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
After it was published, some sociologists wanted to say

1900
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Is there a similar situation in humans?

1901
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So they go and analyze people's data

1902
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It turns out that it is actually on people

1903
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
In fact, it is almost the same

1904
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,300
That is to say, the data

1905
01:21:02,300 --> 01:21:04,100
well that is to say

1906
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:07,680
As a result, the United States is advocating this

1907
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:12,280
To let everyone advocate how to raise

1908
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:16,640
When the value of the family was valued, I actually found my teacher

1909
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:21,760
Testify before Congress that this family is of great value.

1910
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,560
irreplaceable

1911
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,340
when can you use

1912
01:21:25,340 --> 01:21:28,160
I actually feel like I just said that stuff

1913
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,460
that is to say actually

1914
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,260
this is an idea

1915
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,060
then you can imagine saying

1916
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:35,320
it is a hypothesis

1917
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:38,140
As for people, there are actually many times

1918
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:40,440
you can go to test

1919
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,220
That

1920
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,520
I think the question is

1921
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:47,100
If you haven't taken the test you can't take it for granted

1922
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,900
this is on top of people

1923
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,180
just the same

1924
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:53,760
But you can say it's a logic or say a hypothesis is

1925
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,060
to explain a lot of what you see

1926
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,600
For example, I just said

1927
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,240
This warming example

1928
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,160
you go to see people

1929
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,400
There are a lot of literature telling you that

1930
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,600
Warming will actually increase human violence

1931
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,300
There are a lot of literature

1932
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,300
Then there was a special issue a few years ago

1933
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,600
But I can tell you based on my research

1934
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,100
will not only increase human violence

1935
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,100
Because I see in the bio that means

1936
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,800
The harsh environment has actually increased a lot

1937
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:23,800
Biological Tendency to Cooperate

1938
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,100
so i feel

1939
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:28,800
My research has shown that these research people say

1940
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,500
In fact, there is an Otterative explanation

1941
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,000
Then they can test

1942
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,100
But before testing

1943
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,300
I dare not say that it must be true if it is above people.

1944
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,100
So what I mean is

1945
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:41,400
In fact, when you study many organisms

1946
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,700
your imagination

1947
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,100
You can imagine more

1948
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,500
just not only

1949
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,900
For example, what we see with our prejudices

1950
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,300
come please

1951
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:59,700
i ask thank you for your speech

1952
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
very exciting

1953
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Then you mentioned the animal example

1954
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
affected by the environment

1955
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
You said the higher the temperature

1956
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Mr. Kun will cooperate more

1957
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Are there any examples of plants?

1958
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
That is to say, the higher the temperature

1959
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
How plants work together

1960
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
or any other behavior of plants

1961
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
In fact, we know that plants are also fire

1962
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
affected by the environment

1963
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Thank you

1964
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
actually a long time ago

1965
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Of course, because my plant room has been covered

1966
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I would have thought of researching

1967
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
In fact, some people have studied

1968
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
plants of course look

1969
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
you look like it won't move

1970
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
In fact, there is also a lot of competition among plants

1971
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
most research

1972
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
is that it invests in this leaf

1973
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
root ratio

1974
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
So you combine plants with other

1975
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's when we're together

1976
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
In fact it will have a research

1977
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
That is to say, in fact, you separated

1978
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
they can still feel

1979
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
next to another entity

1980
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
it will invest more in root competition

1981
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,120
So actually these game theory ideas

1982
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:04,520
actually on the plant

1983
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,320
I don't think it can be used

1984
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:08,800
It's already used

1985
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,400
that's just not that detailed

1986
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,120
Because they may only use the results to say

1987
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,520
where do you invest more

1988
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,120
so

1989
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,160
Therefore, it should be a direction worthy of future research.

1990
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,120
I ask for advice

1991
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,440
This system you use with normal creatures

1992
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,600
as Model System

1993
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,040
when wanting to push it to people

1994
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,320
have a big problem

1995
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:39,320
No animal knows how to use a computer

1996
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,120
no internet

1997
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,440
these emerging things

1998
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,160
Subverted many, many social behaviors

1999
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,000
Trump may be approved today

2000
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,800
Actually they are very similar

2001
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,400
because they all use

2002
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,640
a very

2003
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,600
His group is a specific group

2004
01:24:58,600 --> 01:24:59,960
Trump he is

2005
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,500
Because the mantra is low, these people who are poorly paid by white people

2006
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:08,500
but unfortunately they also use the internet

2007
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,500
So it's easy for them to call something

2008
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:16,500
So their behavior is no longer biological

2009
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,000
This is my opinion

2010
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,500
Ke P won because of the Internet

2011
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:25,500
So you don't feel that modern society

2012
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,500
There are many things that may not work

2013
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:33,500
traditional biological behavior to judge

2014
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,500
Is there any reason

2015
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:38,500
actually

2016
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,500
But I'm being honest with you

2017
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,500
That is to say, when you have more graduate students

2018
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,500
You will feel that this person is different from emotion

2019
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:49,500
rare

2020
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:52,500
People are of course very special

2021
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,500
human-like social organization

2022
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:59,500
we are very social

2023
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
But you said a lot of our behavior

2024
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:11,000
In fact, I think it is very similar to what we see in life.

2025
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
right

2026
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,000
For example, my favorite example in class is to say

2027
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
In fact, the difference between men and women

2028
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
For example, yes... there are children

2029
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,000
But this is to say that a lot of research is, for example, on the sexual behavior of men and women

2030
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:35,000
The difference is actually very similar to the explanation above in life.

2031
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
In fact, there are very simple explanations, such as why that

2032
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Sociology studies

2033
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
In fact, what I find interesting is that people in sociology actually do these things.

2034
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
For example, you go to dad and ask

2035
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,000
If a girl asks a boy, would you like to go home with me, for example?

2036
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I said I have a glass of wine with these ratios

2037
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
In fact, there are many men and women who are very different.

2038
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,160
cultural things

2039
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:07,000
Then I think one of the benefits of our study of biology is that

2040
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,560
In fact, it can make you understand human beings better.

2041
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,240
I'm not saying that all things are the same

2042
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,400
But in fact, I think many things are the same

2043
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,960
That's right, I'm from Kaohsiung

2044
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:22,860
so i went to visit sun yat - sen university

2045
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:25,760
There are many monkeys in the back mountain of Sun Yat-sen University

2046
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,900
so they have a monkey expert

2047
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,900
he explained to us

2048
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,900
There are three groups of monkeys

2049
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,900
one is on flat ground

2050
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,900
will run to other people's houses

2051
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,900
Some are in the middle of the mountain

2052
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,900
some are on the mountain

2053
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:41,900
but anyway

2054
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,900
they also have groups

2055
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,900
That group has Monkey King

2056
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,900
I'm not here to grab your job today

2057
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,900
But the monkey king

2058
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,900
he has many wives

2059
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:58,900
So he has little two little three little four little five

2060
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,680
Because when little five and little four may not be taken care of

2061
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,560
Just secretly go there with his subordinates

2062
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,440
The monkey king will be very angry like a human

2063
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,440
Same as yesterday's photo

2064
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:15,040
Then he will kick that little five out

2065
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:18,880
So people do behave like monkeys

2066
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,400
Of course it's very close to us

2067
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,080
it's already alike

2068
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:26,880
so but have you seen other animals with similar ones

2069
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,720
like you study many birds

2070
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,720
I heard that the bird also had an affair, isn't that the case?

2071
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:39,120
Yes, in fact, I have a student who is studying this crown and beautification

2072
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,040
It's the ratio of his cheating

2073
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,720
External pair ratio

2074
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,920
In fact, it will also be affected by the ecological environment

2075
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:49,840
In fact, they are when the environment is better

2076
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,040
relatively strong

2077
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:53,040
Really are

2078
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,040
Recently going to post this

2079
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,840
I'm not the one in the back seat

2080
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,840
he's been doing this

2081
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,500
that i'm sorry let me ask another question

2082
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:06,260
the bird he said you said different bird

2083
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,260
he is in the same grass right

2084
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,000
Don't the rest of the eggs look alike?

2085
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,500
how does he know which egg belongs to his little one

2086
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,500
Yes, actually the most interesting part of this is that

2087
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:17,800
he doesn't know he doesn't know

2088
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,800
That is, but he knew he was Mr.

2089
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,200
That is, from the results we can see that

2090
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,900
In fact, it's the guy who's an asshole who will serve the bomb first.

2091
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,200
So you just need to know that my husband is fucked, I will take the bomb first

2092
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,700
It doesn’t matter which one, in fact, when a child pays more than others

2093
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,300
Because of him, everyone is a child and doesn't know who belongs to whom.

2094
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:40,400
So I just want my kids to be very competitive

2095
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,600
In fact, he will eat more food like that.

2096
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,500
So they, I don't think life is interesting, that is

2097
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,900
Their solution to the problem is simple

2098
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,400
Yes, but it can achieve the same effect

2099
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,900
I have a few questions

2100
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Regarding the picture, you said it was OnePayer, right?

2101
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
He lived together again during OnePayer

2102
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:16,000
So in this case, will he have a situation where he will have a MixUp when he is suffering?

2103
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
This is the first question

2104
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:22,000
The second question is that we know that there are polygamists in all living things

2105
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
some are monogamous

2106
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Is there any difference between these two forms for his survival?

2107
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Is polygamy easier to survive or monogamy

2108
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
The third question is that I just thought of it because I studied at U

2109
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
That U is also Mormon

2110
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
when they came from the east

2111
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Many men are dead

2112
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
As a result, they become polygamy

2113
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Then they stopped doing it because the federal government interfered

2114
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
But in this situation, look at people from your biological point of view

2115
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Monogamy is better

2116
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It's better to be polygamous

2117
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
That's especially the case where there are so many smart people in the Chinese Medicine Hospital

2118
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
If this breed is monogamous

2119
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Isn't this a waste?

2120
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I want to look at it from a biological point of view

2121
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Is this an excellent breed

2122
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
It should be to let him live more

2123
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
this is dangerous

2124
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,000
In fact, there are various aspects of this department of biology.

2125
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
That's it

2126
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
That is to say, it is actually human monogamy or polygamy

2127
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
his is to say

2128
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
If you actually look at the current society

2129
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
That is to say, influenced by Western civilization

2130
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
this society other than this tribe

2131
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
In fact, there are many changes

2132
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Well, anthropologists actually did some research

2133
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It was found that one of the most important causes of influence is that

2134
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
If your property is, say, land

2135
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
farming you can accumulate a lot of property

2136
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,260
or you are prologue you can have a lot of sheep

2137
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,060
or those of cows

2138
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,140
you can accumulate a lot of wealth

2139
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:09,340
Then it will become a multi-episode like this

2140
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:11,940
So for example if you were a hunter

2141
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:13,780
You are a hunter, in fact, you will fight again

2142
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:16,240
It may be difficult for you to hit too many

2143
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,640
So at that time it will be closer to the first phase

2144
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,140
So from our point of view it is

2145
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:22,840
Of course it doesn't mean that culture doesn't matter

2146
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,240
But there are actually some ecological factors

2147
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,000
allows you to account for these variations

2148
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,960
but you said

2149
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,660
so-called good or bad

2150
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,960
This is a very

2151
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:36,160
I think it depends on whether your definition is good or not

2152
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,200
What means

2153
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:39,760
That is to say, from our point of view, we will feel that

2154
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,600
It's actually hard to answer

2155
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,360
This one-period or multiple-period

2156
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,960
Or even like, say, Yunnan

2157
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:47,860
This issue has multiple

2158
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,260
In fact, there are reasons for it

2159
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:52,300
That very important point is that

2160
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,700
You have to look at it from an individual point of view

2161
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:55,960
why is this the result

2162
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:59,020
Because, for example, the reason for talking about the individual just now is to say

2163
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:00,020
if i today

2164
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,880
like a rich man

2165
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,080
In fact, even in today's society

2166
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,400
he is still polygamous

2167
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:08,800
That's not really for the good of the group

2168
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,320
He is for personal good

2169
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:14,320
So the shaping of this pairing system

2170
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:18,800
In fact, there is a conflict between the individual and the group.

2171
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:22,920
Then he also from the perspective of a population

2172
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,360
From the point of view of a group

2173
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:27,040
There's a Big Reason Why We're Monogamous

2174
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,840
that is

2175
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,480
If polygamous

2176
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,640
In fact, the natural phenomenon of this group is that

2177
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,640
there will be many people without wives

2178
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,280
So at this time, social problems will actually be very big.

2179
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:42,000
Because of this conflict will become very high

2180
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,040
That is, the conflict between the public will become very high

2181
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:49,280
So maybe monogamy can reduce this

2182
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,800
Just forcing everyone to do this

2183
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:55,040
It is a way to reduce this conflict

2184
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,840
What about Huamei

2185
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:59,840
I just said that our

2186
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,400
Because we have tested DNA, it has at least 70% of children

2187
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,900
is the behavior of the pairing above

2188
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,900
So for this example, they live so close

2189
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,900
The proportion of European and foreign pairings is actually not high

2190
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:15,400
In fact, most of the children are us

2191
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,600
In human terms, it is called marriage and childbirth

2192
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,400
you can tell they're a couple

2193
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,100
Let's see him as a couple

2194
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:25,800
He's actually going into pairs during the time he's mating

2195
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,300
So we use that to define

2196
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,900
It turned out that the DNA test was actually quite accurate.

2197
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:33,700
So we test DNA with DNA

2198
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,100
then i want to ask

2199
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:37,300
then you talk about it first

2200
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:39,100
thanks for the interesting talk

2201
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:40,500
I want to ask

2202
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,800
just a very interesting thing is the lobster

2203
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,400
the way they attack

2204
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,900
Then you mentioned that the group is relatively large

2205
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,300
more difficult to decide

2206
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:51,500
that i mean

2207
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,800
I want to say will it

2208
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,300
It is not actually a cause it is actually an effect

2209
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,700
It means that you can't do well because you are better

2210
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,000
it's up to you

2211
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Quicker decision, of course he left when he was still in a small group

2212
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,360
Then he may be the more difficult individual for him to decide.

2213
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,560
He'll just keep getting bigger and bigger

2214
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,560
So he maybe he is a country not a battalion

2215
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,400
then can you

2216
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,760
But because this thing is the process he is going around

2217
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,160
He is actually the collaborator. He actually went to see it.

2218
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,400
So he's not saying that I'm getting bigger and bigger

2219
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,560
Yes, there are a lot of them going around like this

2220
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:29,440
In other words is it possible to have other quotes

2221
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,760
For example, compare those decisions

2222
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,240
I keep saying that assuming he is a country

2223
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:36,600
Then he decided earlier that it might be them

2224
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,840
For example, their genetic similarity is relatively close

2225
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,440
so they can decide earlier

2226
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,040
Oh, I'm gonna suck my life myself

2227
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:48,840
Then the less he knows him, the less likely he is to get ahead

2228
01:35:48,840 --> 01:35:50,640
so he gets bigger and bigger

2229
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,240
But perhaps to a certain extent they still

2230
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,040
I don't know I just think

2231
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,040
Yes because of course in this example it means

2232
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,440
studying insects means

2233
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,940
if you ask me what my burial or something

2234
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,240
i can tell you

2235
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:07,440
but when you go diving

2236
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,800
In fact, doing field experiments is like this

2237
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,040
It is the species studied in Vietnam

2238
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,600
Like lobsters, we don't have that information.

2239
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:14,880
That is to say, for example, we can't

2240
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,640
Just kept drawing blood for research

2241
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,680
So there are actually many possibilities

2242
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,640
not so easy to play right

2243
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:27,580
game theory if used

2244
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:32,380
Actually those lobsters they're kind of selling flowers

2245
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:34,080
have a look

2246
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:37,680
In fact, the first person to go out said that he was the most timid

2247
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:39,580
for saying i'm sorry

2248
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:43,580
Then I'll hurry up, I'll run first

2249
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:44,580
otherwise, right?

2250
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:47,180
Foxes who are less afraid of death

2251
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:48,580
stand there and go around

2252
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:50,980
That's why everyone is hiding

2253
01:36:50,980 --> 01:36:53,380
let's see who goes first

2254
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:56,480
Those who go first may be more timid.

2255
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:59,780
Here's my halftime theory

2256
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,160
Actually, of course I don't know about these

2257
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,740
But that is to say, in the animal

2258
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:05,640
the so-called timid and brave

2259
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,740
In fact, it has been quantified a lot

2260
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:10,400
This is also the individuality of animals in general.

2261
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,340
That is, if you have cats and dogs

2262
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:14,240
You know that animals are just like people

2263
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,700
have different personalities

2264
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:18,240
Well, this is the fact that many people have studied it in the past few years.

2265
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:19,640
side issue is that

2266
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,440
I've always wanted to go to Antarctica because of that research.

2267
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:24,340
You know there are similar behaviors that are penguins

2268
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:25,640
Antarctic penguins

2269
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,240
If the vice president organizes a group in the future, he can go to Antarctica like this

2270
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:31,080
So the penguins have a very special behavior

2271
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,880
before they jump into the sea

2272
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,940
Same thing, you don't know if your predators are in there

2273
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:39,280
So they'll actually be waiting there too.

2274
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,840
Then everyone should not be the first to jump like this

2275
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,040
because you jumped first

2276
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,440
easy to eat

2277
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:47,380
But it's impossible not to jump off and eat forever

2278
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:48,680
So it's actually similar

2279
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:49,640
that you can go and say

2280
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,040
Are different group sizes

2281
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,940
Then when different feeding pressures

2282
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:54,340
People who jump into the sea will be different

2283
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,840
That penguin might be easier

2284
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,040
you can go

2285
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,880
It is better to watch more observations

2286
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Next to him is Nanjiwan

2287
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,880
Thinking about transformation is like becoming a human on Earth

2288
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,680
People from Earth City

2289
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:36,240
Or the transformation and thinking that I am just a Taiwanese

2290
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:41,440
It seems that if you change your consciousness at any time, you can change the size of the group you belong to

2291
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,760
So what I'm curious about is that

2292
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,760
it's true all animals

2293
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:49,120
He only relies on his body

2294
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:49,840
by his blood

2295
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,600
Rely on his muscle group to divide the group

2296
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,320
Or, in fact, there are animals that look like humans.

2297
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,120
Just change the group when you think about transformation

2298
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:00,080
Like saying it's supposed to be a spouse, he might be on

2299
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,160
Did you join another group when you were a teacher?

2300
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,140
Is the other group because of physiological

2301
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:09,360
or willing or unwilling to accept them for psychospiritual reasons

2302
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,800
Ask the teacher if he observes the animals and notices

2303
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:15,700
Animal videos also seem to be able to show motion and change the group

2304
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,200
Thanks

2305
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:21,100
Of course the first one is like our burying bug

2306
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:22,560
Although he is so small

2307
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:24,660
their behavior is

2308
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:26,900
I also think he is very flexible

2309
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:28,660
We do various tests in the laboratory

2310
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:32,820
You can let him choose whether you want 30 grams of meat or 40 grams of meat

2311
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:35,320
Then when there are environmental challenges

2312
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:38,060
He can do everything

2313
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:41,620
You feel like you made the right decision

2314
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:43,420
Then just talk about his social behavior

2315
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:45,220
He cooperates and conflicts

2316
01:39:45,220 --> 01:39:49,560
You are the environment that is one degree worse or the fly is the

2317
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,820
Of course we now know the mechanism

2318
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,560
That means he actually has a smell on his body

2319
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,320
He smells and he becomes very cooperative like this

2320
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,360
That is to say, he actually

2321
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:00,020
I feel better than we think I study animal behavior

2322
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
The biggest feeling is that

2323
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Actually you don't know where their limit is

2324
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
So what I just meant was

2325
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I think you can think about it

2326
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
We feel many, many changes

2327
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
And then many, many things are our free will like this

2328
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Then when you go to see Dongwu you also feel

2329
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
he can do many things

2330
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
and then especially

2331
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
This very simple Togo can do many things

2332
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Well then you say, for example, his

2333
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
We don't know his flexibility

2334
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
that is to say individual

2335
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
But you know that between individuals

2336
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
there is still a big difference

2337
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
So you know my question would be to say

2338
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
how many people

2339
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Is it as free as we think?

2340
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
that is

2341
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
i'm skeptical sometimes

2342
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
It's just that we didn't compare how to see it

2343
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Teacher, your question

2344
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Sociologists have to say people have no real freedom to choose

2345
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
because he was influenced by his upbringing and his environment

2346
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
so now

2347
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
but you know what

2348
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,500
I'm going to talk about this

2349
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:05,000
I feel like the question of men and women is the best

2350
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It's like the difference between men and women

2351
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Talk about social restrictions

2352
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
In fact, I think there are many not many yes

2353
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
That's why all I'm going to say now is

2354
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
The part that isn't

2355
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I think people want to say that men and women are equal

2356
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I really want to say that we are very free

2357
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
But sometimes I feel like saying

2358
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
It's like you just cover your eyes and say

2359
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
These differences are not really

2360
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
just so i mean like this

2361
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I have another question

2362
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,000
you show that beautiful bird about beautiful bird

2363
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
it's grass they come first

2364
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Then the second one squeezes it

2365
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Did you know that the size of the grass is fixed?

2366
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And if you compare

2367
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I said there is a grass that is slightly bigger

2368
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
two go in together

2369
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Wouldn't it be better to raise it together?

2370
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
i want to hear what you mean

2371
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I actually thought about this

2372
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,500
That's right, why don't you make it bigger

2373
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:10,000
But everyone knows it's just one

2374
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,500
When this bird is about to hatch its eggs

2375
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,000
There is a very basic principle

2376
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,500
That is to say, the tree for hatching eggs needs one individual to be able to hatch

2377
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:20,000
I mean you are a bird

2378
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
That is to say, like a picture

2379
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
We know its limit is about seven eggs

2380
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It's seven eggs lined up there

2381
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
is a tree that a bird can heat

2382
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:33,000
When there are eight, you can't heat all of them.

2383
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
So the eggs actually hatch

2384
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
The hatching quality will be very low

2385
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Well, we just haven't seen eight eggs hatch.

2386
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So it's actually useless to become bigger

2387
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
of course

2388
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Said that Cao Bianda and the two hatched the eight eggs together

2389
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Isn't this very energetic?

2390
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
In fact, this situation means

2391
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
In terms of birds, they are called Separate nesting

2392
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,500
is that it separates the grass

2393
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,500
it only hatches

2394
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Then he separates

2395
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,500
So you don't have to squeeze two people in the same slot anymore

2396
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,900
Because it's troublesome, isn't it?

2397
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,900
That is, he just formed two slots

2398
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:09,900
Then, for example, my pair apply this

2399
01:43:09,900 --> 01:43:10,900
this pair put this

2400
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:12,400
then when feeding the baby

2401
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,400
You can feed everywhere

2402
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,900
So in fact various

2403
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,900
What I just said is that there are actually various types of living things

2404
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,900
way of solving the problem

2405
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:21,900
Why not in that point of view?

2406
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,900
It's because we suspect

2407
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:26,900
He actually just said that his success rate is very low

2408
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:29,900
So set up this trough with the hatching eggs

2409
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,900
the price is high

2410
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,900
So if you put this price

2411
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,900
I don't need to be together if we separate again

2412
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:37,900
Because pre-division actually

2413
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:38,900
no matter how many you feed

2414
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:40,900
Each child still needs to eat a certain amount

2415
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,900
So it's actually building a trough

2416
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:43,900
Let's make a slot together

2417
01:43:43,900 --> 01:43:45,900
When hatching eggs, I apply three and five pills by myself.

2418
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,900
probably not much worse

2419
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,900
because he spends a lot of time

2420
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:49,900
a lot of strength is

2421
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,900
spent when he was going to fly out to eat

2422
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,900
Then come back and apply like this

2423
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:55,900
So we feel he has great interests

2424
01:43:55,900 --> 01:43:58,900
It's on this common trough and hatch

2425
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:00,900
so he can lower

2426
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,660
cost per reproduction

2427
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:05,060
If it fails, it can start over faster.

2428
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:05,940
here we have data

2429
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:07,940
That is to say, after a large group of failures

2430
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:09,940
it can start again in three days

2431
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:14,140
Ask the teacher

2432
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:16,680
so much of us from within

2433
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,040
And the tens of thousands of species

2434
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:20,940
Then why did the teacher treat the burial bug

2435
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:23,120
especially come and study

2436
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,180
It's better value for research

2437
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:26,680
where thanks

2438
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:31,380
Well, that's right.

2439
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:33,480
That's the story simply told

2440
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:35,080
Actually I started from college

2441
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:38,580
I am a research bird, the research crown has a picture

2442
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:39,980
Then actually after I came to America

2443
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,680
After learning game theory

2444
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,780
I think it's because of the birds

2445
01:44:43,780 --> 01:44:45,580
I didn't tell everyone

2446
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:46,780
It's my manuscript that day

2447
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:49,340
Originally voted for Science

2448
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:51,040
Then what about Wei Yue's opinion?

2449
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,440
It means that you are not manipulating your environment

2450
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:55,440
Then everyone knows what I just said

2451
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,300
What is the environment is rainfall

2452
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,140
It's time for review

2453
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:59,200
you didn't manipulate

2454
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,200
no operation this rain

2455
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,580
The amount of rain so you can't prove that it's all rain

2456
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,140
Then what do you think I can do?

2457
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,700
Which means I can't actually manipulate the rain gauge.

2458
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:13,060
So I feel that if I say yes, I can’t do research. If people ask me, I can’t operate it.

2459
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:15,100
So I just wanted to say I'm going to study insects

2460
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,180
Many people who study theory study insects

2461
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:21,760
And that's because I can experiment with whatever you ask me.

2462
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:25,080
What about the burial bug? What makes him special is actually

2463
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:27,140
Because many people have studied

2464
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:27,900
From another country

2465
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,700
So some basics

2466
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,300
so i know he has social behavior like this

2467
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,060
Then

2468
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:34,360
There are many in Taiwan

2469
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:35,640
so then

2470
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,680
Originally, it was the choice between the burial bug and the wasp.

2471
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:39,220
But because I feel in Taiwan

2472
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,820
I don't want the tide I studied to be knocked out with stones.

2473
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:46,380
So the Burying Worm doesn't really matter where he is

2474
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:46,640

2475
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:47,660
that is

2476
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:48,940
it's more convenient

2477
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,080
Mr. Sun, the host and all the audience

2478
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:56,620
The question to ask is

2479
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:58,160
we are at

2480
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,160
Find the origin of a species

2481
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Also is what kind of method to find

2482
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Is it by way of intersection or already

2483
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Disc filling to distinguish

2484
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Thanks

2485
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
good

2486
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
like just said

2487
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Limber Buried Barrier

2488
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
For example, where is his origin?

2489
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
that's usually

2490
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It's actually kind of like that

2491
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
For example, when we talk about human

2492
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
For example, the Nandao Yuzu

2493
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
where is this origin

2494
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
A similar logic would say

2495
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
to see where he originated

2496
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Maybe his diversity will be higher

2497
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
so

2498
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
that's a way

2499
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Of course, from this point of view

2500
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
That is to say, you can actually use

2501
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
use that

2502
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
genomics of the genetic way

2503
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
go back and say the same

2504
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Where is his variation higher?

2505
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Then you can read and say

2506
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
The higher place may be

2507
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
where he originated

2508
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
because later he will

2509
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
just fall apart

2510
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Are there any other questions?

2511
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
So research biology is

2512
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
quite useful

2513
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Interesting, I've seen a BBC one before

2514
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Studying off the coast of Milbren, Australia

2515
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,000
It's underground, theirs, I don't know who is the Captain

2516
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Saw a bunch of crab shells on that bitch

2517
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It was later discovered that those crabs were originally on the bottom of the sea

2518
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
At a certain point in time, like when the moon is full or something

2519
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,000
All of a sudden it will gather and become a very large group

2520
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,000
It turns out that they want to protect themselves, he wants to shed his shell, and change that shell

2521
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
so all together it seems big

2522
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
After finishing it, it will fall off within a day because the shell will harden

2523
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
So that day is very dangerous, it will be cured by starfish or something

2524
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
So there are really many interesting things in this

2525
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Like the lobster you just showed, I'm marching there

2526
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Very interesting, where is that?

2527
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,500
I heard from the teacher of the Institute of Oceanography that Taiwan also has

2528
01:48:03,500 --> 01:48:04,500
Taiwan also has

2529
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:05,500
OK

2530
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:07,500
well don't know if not

2531
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,500
Yes, I have

2532
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,500
sorry i didn't see

2533
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:10,500
come thank you

2534
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:12,500
teacher ask

2535
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:14,000
That is Crown and Beauty

2536
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
is actually

2537
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Since if he fights for so long

2538
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,500
His next generation of competition you will reduce if

2539
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,500
Then why fight for so long

2540
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,000
Will this behavior stay

2541
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,500
won't be eliminated

2542
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,500
I'll just talk

2543
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,000
I thought this concept

2544
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,500
no stranger to people

2545
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:32,500
because we do this every day

2546
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:33,500
right

2547
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:37,000
more formal

2548
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,500
That is to say, in fact, from the perspective of the game

2549
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:42,500
In other words, the solution to the problem

2550
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,500
not the most efficient way

2551
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:46,500
It's the way others can't dress you

2552
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,500
that is to say a lot

2553
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,000
many things in the world

2554
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,500
like say ok

2555
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:54,000
Why do you take the exam

2556
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,500
to read so many books

2557
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,500
definitely not those books

2558
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,500
how helpful it is to you

2559
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,000
That is to say, you actually want to win

2560
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Others, that is to say, the logic is very simple.

2561
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
In terms of Guanyi Chemical Media

2562
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
That is to say, you want to say that if someone else lays an extra egg

2563
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
If you don't give birth, you will lose an egg, right, so he will have more children

2564
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Only in this way will the genes be passed on, right?

2565
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
What we call him is not a stable, it is not a stable strategy

2566
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
so it becomes like this

2567
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
So this is an individual behavior, not a group's behavior for the survival of the group.

2568
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
That is to say, what we analyze today is most of the

2569
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Or most of the evolution is that you have to look at the probability of the gene being passed on

2570
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
So it's all from an individual point of view

2571
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
even from a genetic point of view

2572
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
That's how it works

2573
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
There is something wrong with this theory

2574
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Like our current economy is not good

2575
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
So everyone dies

2576
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Logically speaking, I should have to give birth to more

2577
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,640
Only children lose their temper

2578
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:02,140
isn't it

2579
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,760
Actually this question

2580
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,640
is my favorite question

2581
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,000
Because we're studying animals giving birth

2582
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,040
In fact, if you analyze

2583
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:13,600
that is

2584
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:16,640
In fact, people say

2585
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:19,540
That is to say, the one that actually gave birth to the most children

2586
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:23,600
Usually, for example, your agricultural society

2587
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,840
Those situations where you need a lot of manpower

2588
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:28,840
But for example, if you are like Taiwan now

2589
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:31,240
or like Europe

2590
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:32,240
because in fact

2591
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:35,080
Is it a challenge with the ecological environment

2592
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:36,800
is the type

2593
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,400
That is to say, the challenge between us as individuals

2594
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,480
So in other words

2595
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,200
This is rather difficult

2596
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:44,880
That is to say, if you are today

2597
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,600
Everyone farm hard

2598
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:47,880
i can live

2599
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:48,840
then live more

2600
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:50,880
I can eat a little bigger

2601
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,000
then give birth to more

2602
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,840
but not now

2603
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:54,280
if you are a child

2604
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,080
many people may have children

2605
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,800
That is, you have to invest a lot

2606
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,200
then let him have

2607
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
In fact, it is a relationship of competition

2608
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
So biologically speaking

2609
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
This very simple theory is that

2610
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Is it a matter of quantity or quality?

2611
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
is the pressure to choose differently

2612
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
when you are quality

2613
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
will become like Taiwan now

2614
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
It's hard to get everyone to have more children

2615
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
By the way, just to tell everyone

2616
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Why is it important to study biology?

2617
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Like I read in the newspaper someone said

2618
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
To solve the fat burning problem in Taiwan

2619
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I encourage everyone to be born like this earlier

2620
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
I tell you it's the same logic

2621
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
it's out of the question

2622
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Because I just said that if it is for the quality of the relationship

2623
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
You can't have a baby earlier

2624
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
so it's absolutely impossible

2625
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
what can i do

2626
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Of course, if you are interested

2627
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
very simply say

2628
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
today's pressure

2629
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
as just said

2630
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
If you can't even afford a house

2631
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
it's absolutely impossible

2632
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
It must be like what I just said

2633
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
you gotta stay home when ken is like that

2634
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
So questions like these

2635
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,700
if there is no way

2636
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:03,340
this is not

2637
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:05,240
so no easy answers

2638
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,740
OK good

2639
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:07,840
that time relationship

2640
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:10,200
We temporarily thank Professor Shen

2641
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,340
ok thank you all
