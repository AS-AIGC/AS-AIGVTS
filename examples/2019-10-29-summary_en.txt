This video is the 2018 Governor Xiangyan Science Popularization Lecture. Wang Xiangyu, deputy director of the Institute of Astrophysics, is invited to give a speech. The content involves the introduction of astronomical observation instruments and their operating principles, as well as how astronomers use these instruments to obtain information about the mass, temperature, and distance of celestial bodies. . At the same time, the imaging quality and infrared design in astrophotography, as well as the application of optical systems in spectral analysis are also discussed. In addition, the film explores the operational challenges of instruments in extreme environments and the improvement of astronomical image quality by image processing technology. This film explores the techniques, equipment and associated challenges required for astronomical observations. First point out the time and academic pressure of establishing an observatory, and discuss the future application of high-resolution sensors for astronomy and the reasons for choosing 10 micron pixel size. The video introduces the requirements of astronomical photosensitive elements and the difficulties in cooperating with manufacturers, and uses the Mexican Observatory project and two important astronomical satellite projects as examples. In addition, the film touches on issues such as the procurement of optical materials and the construction of telescopes in mainland China, and discusses the reasons for the selection of the observatory's location and the impact of humidity and temperature on the water vapor content in the air. As a cross-field integration platform, the Institute of Natural Physics shares knowledge related to astronomical observations in popular science lectures, such as wide-angle observations of the moon. ,
