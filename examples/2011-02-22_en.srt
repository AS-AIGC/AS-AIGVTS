1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ready?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome to the second part of the program.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The second part of the program is about the knowledge of the second month.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's start.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please welcome the vice president of the Wang Hui Jun.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you for your time.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Good evening, everyone.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you for joining us today.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you for your time.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,740
Today we are very happy to invite you to the Institute of Biochemistry, Academia Sinica

11
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,140
Professor Lin Junhong, Researcher of the Institute of Biochemistry

12
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,040
Let me introduce Professor Lin a little bit, although you may have one

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,540
However, there is a bit of information on this that is not quite correct.

14
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,080
That Professor Lin Junhong graduated from the Chemistry Department of our National Taiwan University

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,020
So is it my junior brother or someone called me just now?

16
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:43,120
What is it called Tang? Brother Tang, some people say that I am Tang Gong or something

17
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,420
anyway, so I'm a grown-up

18
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,180
After he graduated from the Chemistry Department of National Taiwan University in 1990,

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,780
Just go to the Scripps Research Institute in the United States

20
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,880
It was a very distinguished

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,020
the research unit

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,820
academic unit

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,100
you may

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,680
Some are not clear, but if I say that Dean Weng used to work there

25
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,440
in the back

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,500
Before our middle school

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,540
When he was dean he was in

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,320
Scripps

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,120
Our teacher Lin Junhong is here

30
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,940
Under the guidance of Dean Weng

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,480
received this Ph.D.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,760
then

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,120
Arrived on the east coast of Harvard in the United States

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,680
From West Coast to East Coast Harvard University

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,960
of this

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,720
It's a medical school

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,160
This one is very famous with Chris Walsh

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,320
this

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,160
The professor is also doing a very good job in developing drugs

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,960
so we are

41
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,040
There is a saying in academia that says

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,560
his portal is very good

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
The Right Pedigree

44
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,400
after that come back

45
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,680
quilt

46
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,480
At that time, the director of our mythology

47
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,480
Director Liu Derong

48
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,560
Recruit back

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,620
Since then, he has performed very well.

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,860
that's a lot

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
many awards

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
then this

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Here, for example, in

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Scripts already got a lot

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
nice award

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The trustee then transmits the academic award

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is not easy

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Because you are applying for this award in Taiwan

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It seems that our comprehensive hospital only gets one

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so he got the award too

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so recently

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He also got our Li Tiande

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
he is a drug company

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He has an established some young academic awards

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
he also got the award

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Also very famous internationally

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He also got us a

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
An Academic Alliance of Developing Countries

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We are Pros

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
he also got the young man award

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So it's all young young young

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
so he's our ten youngest

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
what is it call

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
top ten potential figures

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So it's not just potential

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
he is doing very well now

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So the potential has been fully realized

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so we are very happy to have this opportunity

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This information says

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
it's an associate researcher at the manager center

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's wrong, now a researcher

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
National Taiwan University is also a professor, not an associate professor

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So this data

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm going back to this

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Was it made by the secretary team?

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to integer integer

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How to use old data to share with others

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Excuse me

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But today he's going to make us a

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I believe sir is a brilliant actor

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
called health medicine tonic

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I now think he was super wrong

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
is the name of the movie

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But he's coming to tell us in a simple way

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Come talk to us about drug development

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
what's the matter with this aspect

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
have some secrets

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So he's coming to make a

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's an in-depth introduction

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Today's Liberty Times

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
In fact, his secret has been leaked

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So I wrote a little report in it

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Then we warmly welcome Professor Lin

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,340
Thank you Vice President Wang

105
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,840
can you hear my voice

106
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,400
First time using this microphone

107
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,340
they say i look like mike jackson

108
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,840
But I'm not that handsome

109
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,600
skin is not so white

110
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,440
First of all, I am very grateful to Vice President Wang for the opportunity

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Vice President Wang was actually the head of the house who was on us before.

112
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,040
He actually promoted me

113
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Today I am also very grateful to Wang for the opportunity

114
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,440
Because I am doing drug development

115
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,840
I usually collect some information

116
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,440
So when the secretary group informed me that

117
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,240
When you have this please let me talk about this aspect

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
Actually I was shocked

119
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,040
Because I see the presentation time is about 90 minutes

120
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,840
usually i give speeches outside

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,440
I only have 40 minutes for my major

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,940
Suddenly it's 90 minutes

123
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,640
It's a bit of a mess

124
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,840
So or I still collect some data

125
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
let everyone share

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,840
So what am I going to talk about today?

127
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,920
what about first

128
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,160
Everyone seems to have a lot of this drug

129
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,200
But I put this drug into a large category

130
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,000
first category

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,960
This drug is very likely to have something to do with our life-threatening

132
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,080
For example, when you are infected with bacteria inside

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,760
You may soon be off antibiotics

134
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
that or

135
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,640
For example, if you encounter cancer

136
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,880
How do we take an anticancer drug like this

137
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,200
This is life threatening

138
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,960
The second category is related to our quality of life

139
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,720
Say you gain weight

140
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,120
then i think you are no threat to your life

141
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,840
Of course we want to be thinner

142
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,480
so let me tell you

143
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,840
about diet pills

144
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,160
Well of course the Will cylinder

145
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,960
words for boys

146
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,000
Of course it is a serious disease

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,120
That's Will Cylinder

148
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,000
That is to say, you may need to know that normal

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
like our joints

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,120
If you want to strengthen joint function, there is Hanan

151
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,240
or girls

152
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,920
In our general cosmetics

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,260
added uric acid

154
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,900
I will introduce you

155
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,300
The third category is related to our daily life

156
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,820
related drugs

157
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,640
For example, in our life

158
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,060
south americans have some ailments

159
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,480
how to take painkillers

160
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,000
like aspirin or these

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,560
Proton these drugs

162
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,400
In the end, I will talk about two meanings

163
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,240
one is

164
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,100
Thalidomide

165
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,000
this is in

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,320
in the 50s and 6s

167
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,260
famous drug

168
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,900
then it had a pretty tragic outcome

169
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,840
You may also

170
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,800
It's what we usually see in newspapers now

171
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,740
academic unit

172
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,240
Including our Academia Sinica or other universities

173
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,540
There is often a press release of some research and development results

174
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,800
often talk about

175
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,640
Such research and development results

176
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,940
may say expected

177
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,300
Maybe for example it will go into the development of a drug

178
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,660
May be available in 10 years

179
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,960
What the hell are these press releases?

180
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,200
Of course it's a press release written by a reporter

181
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
that may not be entirely true

182
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,300
But it's in every press release

183
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,500
it told you

184
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,460
It is said to be related to drug development

185
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,060
what does that mean

186
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,980
then i think last

187
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,300
Then I will give you some very simple introductions

188
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,140
But at the very beginning, let me tell you something

189
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,660
that is

190
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,940
this way

191
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,520
This is a prescription, it's my family's prescription.

192
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,340
I'm sorry because this isn't obvious by itself.

193
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,920
But generally speaking, if you say that in your daily life

194
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,440
you

195
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,000
Get a prescription first, for example, recently everyone

196
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,040
cold

197
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,840
Then of course you go back to the clinic to get some medicine

198
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,360
After taking the medicine, you are

199
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,680
Just obediently listen to the doctor's instructions

200
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,760
The instructions say to eat several times a day or eat raw liver

201
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,780
or anti eat

202
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,820
Did you take a closer look at your

203
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,360
What's in it?

204
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,660
Then I will give a speech today, of course

205
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,940
I though

206
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,220
but impossible

207
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,760
I am not a doctor myself

208
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,060
I won't tell you what medicine you should and should not take

209
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,620
You guys can't have listened to me for 90 minutes

210
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,180
You know what medicine to take when you give a speech

211
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,240
But I want you to be able to say

212
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,560
In the future, in your daily life, for example, if you see the drug list

213
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,120
At least I will care about the medicines you take

214
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,840
what ingredients

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Now that the Internet is developed

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
In the past you might have to look up books

217
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Now you just look it up online

218
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
probably in

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You'll know the answer in a minute or two

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There are two medicines here

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
i want to tell you

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
One is keratomysine

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is when my family member catches a cold

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Medicines taken at the clinic

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
keratomysine is an antibiotic

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Then the other semitidine is stomach medicine

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That probably means that the medicine contains

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
it has some stomach irritating ingredients

229
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So the doctor prescribed a semitidine

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
it is a stomach medicine

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
gastric protection

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The other three or four ingredients

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
is a component of Violet

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So let's get into the topic now

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the first topic is antibiotics

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But in this part

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
maybe say sorry

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because of many drugs

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
In fact, there are many complicated pharmacology involved in it.

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that many some nouns

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
what about these nouns

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's really hard for me to translate it one by one

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and many many English

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But of course I try to use

245
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let me introduce you in a way

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
First of all, the first topic I want to talk about today is related to antibiotics.

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What are antibiotics?

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Basically it's for bacterial infections when

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
antibacterial

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Of course, if you have a little

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That is to say, if there is a little bit about this aspect

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The first antibiotic was penicillin

253
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
what about this topic

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I might give you an introduction

255
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
who was the first inventor

256
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The first antibiotic was penicillin

257
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
who is the inventor

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
where does it work

259
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Because the bacteria we have today have invaded the human body

260
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then our medicine must be selective, of course.

261
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
because our medicine

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
actually a chemical

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
if you eat it

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
what about the drug

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
hope it doesn't affect anyone

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
have an effect on bacteria

267
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So let me tell you about this later

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How does it work?

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It is related to the cell B of the bacteria

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
why wait a minute

271
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
how did it find out

272
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
it's an interesting process

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
i will explain

274
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
And because when it was discovered

275
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
The timing of this discovery was at

276
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Before the Second World Mass in 1928

277
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Then its research and development from the discovery

278
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
be mass-produced in the end

279
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
applied to human medicine

280
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,000
In fact, it's time for the second mass

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
so what

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In fact many people say

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What about an invention like this?

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Actually changed the secondary world a lot

285
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
final result

286
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
why wait a minute

287
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
After the mass of the second world

288
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
after

289
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Because of this success

290
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
So many pharmaceutical companies started

291
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
started some searching

292
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Are there other drug molecules

293
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
that also has a bactericidal effect

294
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
And so began a chain of discoveries that began

295
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,000
And while there are many, many drugs

296
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,500
with antibiotics

297
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
are antibiotics are antibiotics

298
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
But what?

299
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
as a result of our abuse

300
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Or the bacteria themselves are constantly de-evolving

301
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
or there are constantly some strategies coming out

302
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
So now we meet

303
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,000
The biggest problem is a problem of drug resistance

304
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Protect the most points

305
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,780
On the topic of public security, I will use these projects to give you an introduction

306
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,840
before that

307
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,480
Let me tell you about the medicine in Huang'an

308
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Because of the medicine in Huang'an

309
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,200
In fact, before the invention of adenoids

310
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:13,840
That

311
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,280
before discovery antibiotic

312
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,840
A drug just before aventin was invented

313
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,360
What about Huang'an's medicine?

314
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,640
By itself we say that he is a drug of resistin

315
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,680
Why didn't we say he wasn't a resistin?

316
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,640
Because Huangan's medicine now knows that he is

317
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,240
the growth of a fine smoke

318
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,440
so when you

319
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,040
When the liver is infected with small fine tobacco, you use Huang'an medicine

320
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,280
That's Huang'an medicine?

321
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,280
In fact, it can temporarily prevent the growth of thin smoke so fast

322
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
because if everyone knows

323
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,800
If the growth of thin smoke is based on Daanmen

324
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,920
Is after 20 minutes a generation can start reinstatement

325
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,800
20 minutes grows very fast

326
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,800
So if you take Huang'an medicine

327
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,360
In fact he's mainly targeting his folic acid synthesis

328
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,080
Growth of folic acid into pholate

329
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,520
What about Huang'an's medicine?

330
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,000
So he is because of the ability to block fine smoke

331
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
So bacteria because they need folic acid nutrients

332
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
so it will grow suppressed

333
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
At this time, if your immune system is strong enough

334
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If bacteria grow repressed

335
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If your immune system is strong enough to handle it

336
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Then your bacterial infection can of course be cured

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So what about the internal medicine? It's not an antibiotic.

338
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Because it is, it can only be said that it is a drug that can resist vitamins

339
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But before the invention of this antibiotic

340
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It is a drug that is commonly used by others.

341
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Then the main invention came from this dye

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Therefore, the Huanei drug found at that time was indeed

343
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
inhibits the growth of bacteria

344
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So they started looking for it from a lot of dyes

345
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Is there an active ingredient

346
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You all know that at that time

347
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
In fact, the prevention and control industry is very developed

348
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
so a lot of dye a lot of dye

349
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,240
Then look for these drugs from the dye

350
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,860
What about the first xanthamines?

351
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,600
In history it is here

352
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,400
The entire medical surplus is called

353
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,640
Pontosil is the drug

354
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,400
Do you know why it is called yellow amines?

355
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,100
Because its English name is Sophora

356
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,240
Because it mainly contains this xanthic acid

357
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,300
xanthates and then it adds an amine

358
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,400
Drugs that are slightly not called yellow amines

359
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,200
Pontosil is what we now know is a

360
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
A first drug of the yellow amine class

361
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
to fight bacterial growth

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,500
That in fact it is a Protide

363
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,800
That is to say, the drug is taken into the body

364
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Why is it called Protide?

365
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,900
a subjunctive of the drug

366
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,200
That is to say, it has no function

367
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,500
but eat into the body

368
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,300
Influenced by our body's performance metabolism

369
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,400
it is broken down

370
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,600
The decomposed substances are still the ingredients of the drug.

371
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,800
So it is said to be a drug lead

372
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,700
Precursor Protide

373
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,100
That drug is also very famous

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,540
because I just said

375
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,340
He was before the invention of the resistance number

376
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,140
He is used to fight bacterial infections

377
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,680
Of course he can't sterilize

378
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,480
What about the most famous example?

379
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,500
is in

380
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,780
That is to say, his example is in

381
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,300
early days of war two

382
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,340
war two because

383
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,920
The Second World War probably started around 1940

384
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,220
in the early days because

385
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,760
when war breaks out

386
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,560
There will be many casualties on the field

387
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,860
So if you ever watch those war movies

388
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,400
like saving private lane

389
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,920
or some war movies

390
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,220
If you listen carefully to his dialogue

391
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,540
you will listen carefully when that

392
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,640
When the soldiers are defeated by me, they will call conscripts, and then they will say "sweep the light file, sweep the light file or sweep the light file"

393
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,420
That is to say

394
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,240
He's hurt, hurry up and use this drug

395
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,540
to treat his wound

396
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,820
in the early days

397
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,600
is very important to use

398
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
The other most famous is

399
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,960
He once saved the prime minister this autumn

400
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,240
s life

401
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,780
why

402
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,560
Because I just told him that on the battlefield

403
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,840
just a lot of soldiers

404
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Other guns also include autumn

405
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,340
Why? This is of course a picture of Churchill

406
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,580
Everyone, if you look at the photos of historical phenomena

407
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,080
He already has a tall hat we're used to

408
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
But Churchill

409
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,440
Nathan Churchill

410
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,640
because at the time in the UK

411
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,840
Of course he is here

412
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,940
he is a brelian

413
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,780
At that time, Britain had many colonies

414
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,740
including north africa

415
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,040
Everyone knows that Germany was

416
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,940
Except in aggression in the European battlefield

417
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,540
They go to fight, say, Belgium, Holland, France

418
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,840
Even ended up going to Russia

419
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
In addition, Germany at that time

420
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,040
Originally based on British colonies on the other side of Africa

421
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,340
At that time, Britain had a lot of colonies in North Africa

422
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,140
Then Germany will be killed

423
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,540
His most famous tank army

424
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,240
The general of the Tank Club is called Longmener

425
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,440
He uses the tank company

426
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,640
Use them to say Longmener

427
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,140
he is a stranger

428
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,040
He uses tank club tactics

429
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,240
can rarely north africa

430
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Because the terrain in North Africa is flat

431
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,140
So the war is already urgent

432
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,640
So autumn is also very tense

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,960
He went to Tunisia in North Africa to investigate

434
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,240
Because of course if the leader goes, it can calm down the troops

435
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,200
When I went, I wanted to say

436
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,680
Positive economics to see if the British army can

437
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Able to face off against the German army

438
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,080
I never thought that when he was in Tunicia

439
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,520
he has an infection

440
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,040
this infection is very serious

441
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,320
So at that time, a sick notice was issued.

442
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,480
So of course he can't let Germany know

443
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
germany they are happy to say

444
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,920
British Prime Minister may soon be knocked out

445
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,760
So by that time his daughter had already flown from the UK

446
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,160
to Tunicia beside him

447
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,360
Because at that time Churchill was already ill.

448
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,920
A sickness notice has been issued

449
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,600
didn't expect them

450
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,720
That is to say, the doctor Churchill used this wind-sweeping dragon

451
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,160
Because at that time, Panning Xining had not yet been mass-produced.

452
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,440
I'll talk about it later

453
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,200
So they are using Ponosio

454
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,560
It turned out that Churchill's life was successfully saved.

455
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,920
That means he's responding to the drug, too.

456
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,880
It's his blood that doesn't work

457
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,000
so he can come alive

458
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
then later

459
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,920
Because he can't announce it during the war

460
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,400
But he followed the radio in the newspaper

461
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,240
he just talked

462
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,640
i have a small situation in tunicia

463
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,160
But luckily it’s because it’s Flaming

464
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
Because Flaming is a British Panlin series invention

465
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,800
so saved my life

466
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,280
Because he doesn't admit that Pontos has

467
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
Because Pontos has this drug

468
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,640
It's the yellow and blue drug, Bayer in Germany

469
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,760
So in terms of this moral

470
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,320
Of course because Britain was at war with Germany

471
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,760
He absolutely can't say it's a drug invented by the Germans

472
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,680
he must have said

473
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,280
i have a problem in north africa

474
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,960
Fortunately, it was given to me by Flaming's protest department.

475
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,200
saved my life

476
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,520
So but the fact

477
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,840
Later Deng Ming actually

478
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,920
Churchill killed Huang

479
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,160
Their government affairs killed Huang

480
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,560
In fact, it was the Germans Bayer who produced it

481
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,760
This yellow and blue drug saved Churchill's life

482
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,480
It's a very famous story

483
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,040
then again

484
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
His name is Penningsillin

485
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,800
I just talked about Penning Xilin

486
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,900
He is the first resistance aid in our human body

487
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,600
It's a drug that can treat bacterial infections

488
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
can be sterilized

489
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,900
The inventor, of course, was Alexander Freyming

490
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
That's Freyming

491
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,600
Because of his later contributions to human medicine

492
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,700
He was called SIR by the wind

493
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,800
That's this penning cillin

494
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,200
Our question is of course Penningsillin

495
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
He is usually called Cin-E-S-U

496
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,700
His structure is quite unique

497
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,800
That's for chemistry

498
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,700
Because of his four-five-ring structure

499
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,000
is a very strange

500
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,600
when he invented

501
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,200
no one believes in this structure

502
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,800
So until 1928

503
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,900
Freyming discovered

504
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,600
found out

505
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,700
Afterwards they managed to save the dormitory

506
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,100
Structural identification of Nathan's chemical

507
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,300
I just said this about chemicals

508
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,100
it is a very unstable structure

509
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,500
until the 1950s

510
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,800
There's Dorothy that

511
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,000
good

512
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,500
He just used x-ray to explain

513
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
to really decide on his structure

514
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,000
But why is he called Omeshu

515
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Because Fleming knows

516
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,500
He found this plum fungus

517
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Plum fungus

518
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,000
Because of Plum fungus

519
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The identified chemical

520
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
green plum tree

521
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So usually you will see in literature or books

522
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Some people call it Penisening

523
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Because or called green plum tree

524
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Actually he's just the same thing

525
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,000
Then this is our Dr. Fleming

526
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And then of course their interest in human

527
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
made a great contribution

528
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
will definitely get a nobel prize

529
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
so we will see today

530
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Getu with a lot of bell awards

531
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Because of his ELF research and development

532
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
has a great contribution

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
of course i just mentioned

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Fleming was in 1928

535
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He discovered this phenomenon

536
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's just that Penisening

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This green plum tree itself is not very stable

538
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So there are actually some problems in purification

539
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Later, because the people under him were

540
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
Froory and Chain

541
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Rich and Froory

542
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,400
these two people they are

543
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
is his research

544
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,900
Browning's research caught his attention

545
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,200
So they keep putting this

546
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,400
This green plum tree, this chemical substance

547
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,900
saved successfully

548
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,000
And try to figure out how to do production

549
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,900
That's because of the contributions of the two of them

550
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,300
That's why this green plum tree can produce in large quantities

551
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,200
Able to provide medical use

552
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,900
So these three scientists in 1945

553
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
get the nobel prize

554
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,200
Look at 1945

555
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,900
when the war was just over

556
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,000
So he got this Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

557
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,300
Where is his contribution?

558
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,000
Froory Discovered Plain City

559
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,600
It is because of the invention of the green plum tree

560
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,300
Being able to come to this for all kinds of this

561
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,600
Infectious diseases have a therapeutic effect

562
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,200
so they got the nobel prize

563
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
let me tell you now

564
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
its mechanism of action

565
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,600
Pan Lin's soul

566
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,440
Just mentioned that if we're looking for a drug today

567
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,500
What about the drug?

568
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,240
because it is against bacterial infections

569
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,640
What about the drug?

570
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,440
It is good if it has no side effects

571
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,840
it should be selective

572
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,340
That is to say, the drug

573
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,740
Can't have any effect on humans

574
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,140
must not be toxic to humans

575
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,440
But directly

576
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,440
And only to sterilize

577
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,000
So we're going to find out

578
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,300
How is this bacterium different from a human?

579
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,240
that's good

580
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,400
Fortunately, that is to say

581
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,940
What about our human cells and bacteria?

582
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,740
its difference

583
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,080
The biggest difference is the bacterial cell B

584
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,240
So the most important function of elasticity

585
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,080
is deeply synthesized in bacterial cells B

586
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,780
what about this picture

587
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,940
It's actually a Staphylococcus aureus

588
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,780
that you know

589
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,540
Regardless of the lowly bacteria

590
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,540
to our higher human cells

591
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,040
what about all bacteria or cells

592
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,980
it will have this cell membrane

593
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,180
Membrane to put the internal environment of this creature

594
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,540
Isolate from the outside world

595
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,140
We say it's a cell membrane

596
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,040
For bacteria

597
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What about Staphylococcus aureus?

598
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,440
he is a bacterium

599
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,000
Then he has a thick layer of cell arms on the outside

600
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,720
What is the energy of this cell arm?

601
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,120
It is a function of structural support

602
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,360
Why

603
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,760
Because the bacteria itself has to face the inside and outside of the cell

604
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,040
because he maintains a

605
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,160
a physiological

606
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,920
That is to say, one of his various substances

607
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,720
He has to maintain a certain concentration

608
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,000
So he has some osmotic pressure

609
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,360
That is to say, the inside and outside of the cell

610
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,160
his

611
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,480
his concentration is different

612
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,280
So he has a pressure that penetrates him

613
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,400
So if you don't have a strong

614
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,480
supported by a cell arm

615
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
He can't help that bacteria

616
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,120
catch directly

617
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,920
left thick

618
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,360
so he bursts again

619
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,920
Moisture keeps coming in and it will burst

620
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
so what

621
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,360
Rehearsing the mind today is actually mainly in

622
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,200
A synthesis of the cell arm of the main segment

623
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,720
prevent him from building him well

624
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,040
What kind of structure is the cell arm of bacteria?

625
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,240
it's hard for you to say

626
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,800
Today he is a 3D

627
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,920
A network structure in a three-dimensional space

628
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,880
that he is a

629
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
quite complex aggregate molecule

630
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,600
That is you can say it as saying

631
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,420
If this is a two-figure

632
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,220
If this is a sugar body

633
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,240
a polysaccharide

634
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
a chain of sugar

635
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,300
each one is a

636
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,840
a polymer of sugar

637
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,640
What about between each chain?

638
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,440
must be concatenated

639
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,220
then it will have

640
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,780
Its structure has its strength

641
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,320
that sugar body

642
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,120
What about the sugar molecules?

643
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,920
It must use the ecological key to make a series connection

644
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,460
that is, as if you were

645
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,740
Do this like a past event

646
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,500
your

647
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,040
Both vertical and horizontal must be wired

648
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,080
then contact each other

649
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,840
that this

650
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,680
The sugar molecules in the vertical direction have to be connected in series with each other

651
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,700
Need to use ecology

652
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,480
Then this series of steps

653
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,540
In fact, in the whole deep synthesis

654
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,560
last step

655
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,120
Well, it just so happens that the Chinese New Year is at the last step.

656
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,660
make it impossible to connect

657
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,960
So even though it frames this

658
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,760
What about sugar polymers?

659
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,540
But it can't connect well

660
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,560
so

661
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,900
If you use this barbarian today for New Year's

662
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,000
When rehearsing sex, his cell arms are not well connected with each other

663
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,700
Bacteria with such a soft structure can easily swell and die

664
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,000
So this is the main mechanism of rehearsal sex

665
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,800
How did he discover such a phenomenon

666
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,200
It was actually an unexpected discovery that we ended up coming back

667
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:29,500
But the most important thing is that Dr. Flaming carefully noticed such a problem

668
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,600
Then add the weather is also a factor

669
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,500
why?

670
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,100
My work is back to September 1928

671
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,800
At that time, Fleming went on vacation in August

672
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,000
If you all know Fleming himself, although he was already famous at that time

673
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,600
But is he doing the experiment clean?

674
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,100
Why do you guys take a look

675
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,900
you will see this photo this is not a fake photo

676
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,900
You can see that the rows at the back are all the culture names of his bacteria.

677
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,100
So after he finished the experiment, he is usually what we say is very annoying to him.

678
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
A researcher just piled it on

679
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,100
so what

680
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,400
before he let go

681
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,800
he finished the experiment

682
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,500
he has painted some on it

683
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,120
some golden yellow grapes

684
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,920
Just took some experiments on bacterial culture

685
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,800
finished

686
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,200
He just put it on the lab table and walked away

687
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
then come back after a while

688
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
so he went out to play in august

689
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,260
then come back in september

690
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
that's just right

691
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,160
his bacterial culture

692
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,360
Because we usually do bacterial cultures

693
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,600
To avoid the interference of other bacteria

694
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,960
so usually have a cover

695
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,020
I didn't expect him to leave before

696
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,560
He did not throw away the experiment

697
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,680
Even the lid is open for some

698
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,960
came back to find out that

699
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,920
what happened

700
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,620
opened the lid inside

701
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,260
Invasion of other species

702
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,620
he noticed

703
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,260
if everyone can't see

704
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,880
If students like mine see this situation

705
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,860
or me

706
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,760
just to see other pollution

707
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,120
he has dropped it

708
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,520
But he feels very different

709
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,320
because strange

710
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,280
He's got a bunch of bacteria all over it.

711
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,880
But once this strain is added

712
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,040
Strange that it seems next to

713
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,600
No bacteria can survive here

714
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,800
So he is tantamount to noticing that

715
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,400
he must be a microbe

716
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Then this microbe will produce a substance

717
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,100
Can have a bactericidal effect

718
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,700
So it's like being here

719
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,400
These are full of bacteria

720
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,300
bacteria taking place

721
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,800
He then backed off

722
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,300
Because of the existence of this species back off

723
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,400
So he noticed this phenomenon

724
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,900
so he thinks

725
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,300
He later identified that it was a plum fungus

726
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,200
Nomeella because it competes with bacteria

727
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,300
Because it is covered with soil and has nutrients

728
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,500
We say this cultivator

729
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
Then they have to compete for the training machine

730
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,200
So Mei bacteria distinguish some substances

731
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,200
It's like saying this is my domain

732
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,900
you can't come

733
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,400
So the bacteria are all dead.

734
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,500
So there must be a chemical substance

735
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,000
Chemicals have a bactericidal effect

736
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,500
That, of course, later led to his discovery.

737
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,400
the Panicia

738
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,700
that's what i just said

739
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,400
why climate is a major factor

740
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,900
Because of the growth of bacteria he needs

741
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I also know that it needs to be in a high heat environment

742
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So it happens to be the rotating weather in August

743
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,500
Bacteria in this summer environment

744
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,700
bacteria grow happily

745
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,200
But it just happened to take turns

746
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
It was a cold day for a while

747
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,500
that cold weather

748
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,700
especially cold weather

749
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,900
Because the humidity over there is quite high.

750
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,100
Therefore, it is very conducive to the growth of Mei fungus

751
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,400
So there was a summer weather

752
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,100
make this bacteria grow really well

753
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,900
Just after that there was an invasion of plum fungus

754
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,400
Then there's another cold air

755
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,300
Bacterial growth is inhibited

756
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,400
Then the fungus starts to grow

757
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,700
So there is such an obvious contrast

758
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,600
The result of such an obvious contrast

759
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
Let Fu Nanmin know

760
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,100
And he said carefully

761
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
this is not rubbish

762
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,800
It's not trash, it's not meant to be thrown away right away

763
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,600
Rather, it is an interesting phenomenon

764
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,300
He himself said that instead of thinking about finding out

765
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,600
What kind of a dimensional creature is this?

766
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
It turned out to be a plum fungus

767
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,100
So we can say that he is a very unexpected

768
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
an event

769
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
and very lucky

770
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And he is the most important thing to observe carefully

771
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
get such a discovery

772
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Of course Pan Senji

773
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
we just talked

774
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There will be a Jibang in the back

775
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It is Foreign and Chains

776
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
These two he began to explain

777
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Oh, found this phenomenon

778
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He removed the bill of materials

779
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Then prove that this is green plum tree

780
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
what about the problem

781
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What if he can sterilize

782
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
He can certainly deal with bacterial infections

783
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The question is how to apply it to people

784
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Because by then

785
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Bacterial infection is a

786
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
basically a testimonial

787
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's kind of like we got HIV now

788
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
AIDS is the same as encountering this Cancer

789
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
basically unknown evidence

790
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So at that time there was a big

791
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
an effort is to say how

792
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
to mass produce it

793
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Then let me tell you that the data is

794
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He discovered in 1928

795
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But by 1942

796
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
All over the United States and the entire Pensenkey's

797
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The total output can only be one dead patient

798
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Because it cannot be mass-produced

799
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,300
because i just said

800
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,500
Panlin Xinyu itself has many problems.

801
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,300
The first one is unstable, how do you produce it

802
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,100
the second is

803
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,600
And another question is that

804
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
What about its absorption in the body?

805
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
The most original version of Panlin Xinyu is

806
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,100
Not easily absorbed in the body

807
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,700
Probably only two to three two percent can be absorbed

808
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,800
So most of it is drained

809
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,300
equal to if you give it

810
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,600
For example, eating a ground

811
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,700
A word of Pan Lin's heart

812
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,300
About two or three hundred milligrams will go away

813
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,300
So, when it was time to do Pan Lin Xin Yu

814
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,300
Patient's urine shadow it goes to recycling

815
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,600
because it passes into the urine

816
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,500
Look at Taiwan's storage and recycling

817
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,100
If not, the whole

818
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,600
Because you have 70% to 80% of Pan Lin Xinyu wasted

819
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,300
this is a serious problem

820
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,600
So at that time

821
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,100
And it stays in the body for a short time

822
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,500
So it's all downsides of the drug

823
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,400
So fortunately Pan Lin Xinyu discovered it by accident

824
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,300
From a modern perspective

825
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
This Pan Lin Xinyu must be abandoned

826
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,800
because it doesn't meet our requirements

827
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,700
it has a low absorption rate

828
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,300
Then and easily in the body

829
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
only three or four hours but not good

830
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,920
Then you need to pay attention

831
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,800
This Fulhamming he is in England

832
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
so that england is at war

833
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,120
And the UK especially rounds every day

834
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,500
to the German bombing

835
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,800
Basically, the country will send people

836
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,040
So they went to talk to the British government

837
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,180
Can you come to produce panxing

838
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,600
Because we don't have the strength

839
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,640
And at that time there was still a doubt that

840
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,320
At that time, the three recommended

841
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,080
That seems to be Frolly he claims

842
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,040
We're going to take this pattern

843
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,200
Because this will definitely sell well in the future

844
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,680
Fortunately, Fulhamming and Chain objected

845
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,600
Said this is if it can be used like this

846
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,320
make a significant contribution to human well-being

847
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,000
So they refuse to pattern

848
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,680
so what

849
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
Fulhamming he is generous

850
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,440
He sent the county chief to people everywhere.

851
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,480
See if it can be applied

852
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,160
So they just have to go to America to find

853
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,800
so America

854
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,280
They came across this like a gift from the sky

855
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,320
they are happy

856
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,440
So the various plans in it

857
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,640
to find a good county chief

858
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,320
So they later in E-NOR

859
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,040
likely that

860
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,560
Wang Furen at the market in Enoi

861
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,120
find a rotten cantaloupe

862
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,900
The green plum mushrooms on the rotten cantaloupe

863
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,700
Proven to be one of the best strains

864
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Because the output is very high

865
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,520
and

866
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,080
Back then Midwest farming was fresh

867
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,620
so they later found out

868
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,660
because a lot of corn is grown in the Midwest

869
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,460
It turns out they found that the corn

870
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,520
There will be a lot of emissions in the province of turning into cornmeal

871
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,560
this boiling water

872
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,340
This boiling water is used

873
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,400
Do this Plum Fermentation

874
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,440
its yield is very very good

875
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,200
so

876
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,520
one like this

877
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,580
As a result of optimization, its yield is the original

878
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,640
Disk Venus found more than 100,000 times

879
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,000
So by 1942, the entire U.S. production could only be used by 10 patients

880
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,800
By 1943

881
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,820
that time

882
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,120
they can be mass produced

883
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,160
so until

884
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,940
I'll talk about the next one first

885
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
So until 1944

886
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,040
what about them at that time

887
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,580
can already know

888
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,020
2.3 million doses of this

889
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
this dose

890
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,800
So there's enough for over 2 million doses

891
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,200
You can live until 1942 with only 10 patients available

892
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,200
So it is now possible to produce doses up to 230

893
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
So everyone came to the United States

894
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,200
When the whole Confederates landed from France

895
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,500
heavy casualties

896
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,500
So they can heal the casualty with resistance

897
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
Well, this is already known to everyone

898
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,000
They have estimated that there is Pandey's influence

899
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,800
So what about Confederate soldiers?

900
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,700
His casualty rate has been reduced by 12 to 15 percent

901
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
then you'll see this is changing the history of war

902
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,400
Because at this time in Germany they only used Huang Ah Nei's medicine Pontosio

903
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,800
That's the Confederates already have Pandy Sydney.

904
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,500
And there are millions of doses

905
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,100
So the difference between the two sides is

906
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,600
The soldiers of the German side were injured

907
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,300
Probably depends on how good his immune system is.

908
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,900
But here you have antibiotics to treat

909
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,300
So at that time there was a poster

910
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,700
You see three genera pandy sydney

911
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,100
thought there was come home

912
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,900
because he was hurt

913
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,000
But because of proper handling, he will still return to the plane.

914
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,860
The other one is a very famous experiment in 193

915
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,280
Then everyone see this is a little girl

916
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,360
You see she was healed in the end

917
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,480
it's a normal little girl

918
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,120
But at the beginning, there was a serious sense of narrative

919
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,480
Look at him, this, this, this eye clip is next to his eye

920
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,720
This wound is almost festering badly.

921
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,680
You see, this is after adding Penning psychology

922
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,760
his medical effects

923
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,720
You will see the wound gradually shrink

924
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,920
Then this side has already started to the whole domain now

925
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,320
Then there is still some swelling here basically.

926
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,120
But basically the wound has gradually disappeared.

927
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,240
So you basically end up late

928
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,640
you can barely see the wound

929
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,840
So this is a very famous experiment

930
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,960
It's like adding Pan Ning's psychology to the body

931
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,480
He was indeed able to deal with this delicate infection

932
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,240
that is very famous

933
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,760
Then let's see the picture just above

934
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,560
This is just at that time one by one

935
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,880
You see, everyone knows that this is Xiao Wangsun?

936
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,680
It's an ad from 1944

937
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,800
you look like one by one

938
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,360
Just do it on this oil drum

939
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,840
look

940
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,820
Pandin Faith Cure Gonorrhea This is a disease

941
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,940
you see in 4 hours

942
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,100
So you see this number is very similar to now

943
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,940
This drug can release a certain disease within 4 hours

944
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,220
然後 see your doctor today

945
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,060
please see a doctor today

946
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,900
so you see this time

947
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,820
Because it used to be like this, of course it is a sexual disease

948
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,620
I thought it was terminal illness

949
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,020
You see pandin believe in invention he will tell you

950
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,420
4 hours to complete the doctor

951
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,980
So get a doctor today

952
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,100
this is his ad

953
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:33,300
Well, I just mentioned that on case 24

954
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,500
especially at some point

955
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,260
He has been able to produce like this because of Panding belief

956
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,740
And then and can be millions of doses

957
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,020
So the successful application in this battlefield

958
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,460
and save many lives

959
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,500
And at the same time, he also drove the pharmaceutical industry in the United States

960
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,140
because at the beginning it was before 24 cases

961
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,980
actually like merc

962
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,140
he said it was that

963
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,700
Originally, the company was actually a small company.

964
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,980
But because at this time the United States they

965
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Put a lot of manpower and material resources on the arms industry

966
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,600
Because these guns, bullets, planes, and ships are all used in war

967
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,200
because they are in the pharmaceutical industry

968
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,700
Because it takes a lot of rehearsal hearts to save military casualties

969
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,500
So at this time after the war they talked about

970
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,300
Hey, rehearsing the mind has such a drill

971
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,500
yes we can learn from success stories

972
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,600
Let's go find other medicines

973
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,100
It also has antiseptic properties

974
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,700
So in our 50s, 60s, really into the 70s

975
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,500
In the past twenty or thirty years

976
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,100
They searched for all kinds of bacteria from all over the world

977
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,700
including bacteria,

978
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,900
Because this, for example, bacteria and bacteria are living with each other

979
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,400
That is to say, the fire is in the same environment

980
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,500
They will naturally overcome each other

981
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,300
then we saw

982
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,600
Why can the United States bacteria

983
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,900
It is the same reason why this beautiful bacteria can be sterilized

984
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,300
they survive

985
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,100
They'll have this chemical power for each other

986
00:36:59,100 --> 00:36:59,700
so what

987
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,100
this is only

988
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,520
Just to tell you a few examples

989
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,600
For example, the Panlin Xinlin we saw just now

990
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
it is a four five membered ring

991
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,240
Then this tetrahexacyclic ring is called cephalosporin

992
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,360
Its mechanism of action is basically the same as that of Panlin Xinlin

993
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,440
But let me tell you that Panlin Xinlin has many, many problems.

994
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,560
Let's say it's one person dealing with Gram-positive bacteria

995
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,360
That Pan Lin Xin Lin it has some instability issues

996
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,160
Then this avatar

997
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,840
Cebas Corin

998
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,240
this kind of hair

999
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,400
It's actually what we call the Wise Bed

1000
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,800
So if you say you have a cold today

1001
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,840
or some infection

1002
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,800
The doctor had an upper respiratory infection

1003
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,600
Doctors usually give you a standard prescription

1004
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,920
Cebaloxin

1005
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,520
this class of drugs

1006
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,120
That other class

1007
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,200
For example, just said

1008
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,280
This is Panlin Xinlin drugs

1009
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
but we'll talk later

1010
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,240
It has the problem of bacteria itself and some resistance

1011
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,160
So it targets the drug resistance problem

1012
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,440
Lin Xinlin

1013
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,640
do some chemical modification on it

1014
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,440
So this is Panlin Xinlin, which mainly targets drug resistance.

1015
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
and these other drugs

1016
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,480
For example like

1017
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
carouselomine just mentioned

1018
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Just started

1019
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Didn't I have a prescription room at first?

1020
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The doctor has prescribed this carouselomine

1021
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
In addition there is this

1022
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
tetracycline

1023
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
are some commonly used

1024
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
like in eye ointment

1025
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Tetracyclines are often present

1026
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
These are after the war

1027
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
constant search

1028
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Different strains from around the world

1029
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
came to find this compound

1030
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
ok we are done now

1031
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
after antibiotics

1032
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
we now run into this

1033
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Problems we are currently experiencing

1034
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Because

1035
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Although I just said

1036
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
after the second year

1037
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
twenty or thirty years

1038
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Although our scientists found

1039
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
There are dozens of different antibiotics

1040
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that looks like

1041
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
This war seems to be human

1042
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
the upper hand

1043
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Absolutely not

1044
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
we only want certain drugs

1045
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
if it falls

1046
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
bacteria will die

1047
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Not really

1048
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
because I just told you

1049
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Currently encountering problem B

1050
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,500
The problem is even bigger in this case

1051
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
bacteria

1052
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,380
we'll find some superbugs

1053
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,600
This bacterium will kill all current resistant cases

1054
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,500
will produce resistance

1055
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,300
In fact, this problem existed very early

1056
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,200
That is, when rehearsing for a psychologist to use

1057
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,640
There is a problem of drug resistance when used in humans

1058
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,400
Just because there are new drug molecules being invented all the time

1059
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
So this question is ignored

1060
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,840
words here

1061
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,440
What strategies do bacteria have?

1062
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Will there be such a good antimicrobial strategy?

1063
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,340
Basically my side is just talking about two or three different ways

1064
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,340
That is to say, the bacteria have a way

1065
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,940
is that it uses a Lactamase

1066
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,440
That is to say, it is a decomposing enzyme

1067
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,140
Which means you use rehearsal psychomedicine

1068
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,640
It can use it to produce a special enzyme

1069
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,940
Can break down your drug molecules

1070
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,440
So it even if the drug molecule

1071
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,940
can go inside its bacteria to sterilize

1072
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,440
but it can tear you apart

1073
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,240
make you useless

1074
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
another one he can

1075
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,300
He doesn't need to disassemble

1076
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,600
He just takes your drug molecule

1077
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,400
just make it a decoration

1078
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Originally this molecule of yours

1079
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
so that he can continue

1080
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,600
a molecule at a certain position

1081
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,800
because it doesn't work anymore

1082
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,800
he can also bacteria

1083
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,600
He produces something like a helping

1084
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,200
bring your stuff in

1085
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,600
just hit it outside

1086
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,800
Hit it outside as soon as you come in

1087
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
so your meds never work

1088
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,400
into the bacteria

1089
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,200
so he has all sorts of different strategies

1090
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,000
molecules to fight our drugs

1091
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,800
What kind of strategy is there?

1092
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,600
That is to say, bacteria basically

1093
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,400
It has many disadvantages than us

1094
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,600
has many advantages

1095
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,300
why

1096
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,900
From birth until our twenties

1097
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,400
We often get married and have children

1098
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,200
The bacteria I just talked about

1099
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,300
he grows very fast

1100
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,900
In twenty minutes he is a generation

1101
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,600
start splitting

1102
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,900
that and he a lot

1103
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Usually like when you get a bacterial infection

1104
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,600
Your body has a population of millions of bacteria

1105
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,000
and he's easy

1106
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,440
So he has mutations of all kinds

1107
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
aftermath

1108
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,640
sure as long as

1109
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,940
Let's say you have millions of different mutants

1110
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,140
As long as one can resist antibiotics

1111
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,240
he survived

1112
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,040
Let me give you a practical statistical example

1113
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,740
come talk to you

1114
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,740
This is revealed from a book

1115
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,440
that is to say today

1116
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,640
A patient enters for whatever reason

1117
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,740
he went into the hospital

1118
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,840
what about this time

1119
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,040
We have a few dorms here

1120
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
Let me give you a little explanation

1121
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,880
If it is a MS here

1122
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,440
He said that for this Message in Sensitive

1123
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,800
That means he's a drug for you

1124
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,440
can be sensitive

1125
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,940
It means that the medicine you are taking is effective

1126
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,200
What if R

1127
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,900
It is Message in Resistant

1128
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,280
That is, he is a drug-resistant strain

1129
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,000
That means after entering the hospital

1130
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,480
at this time

1131
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,800
This your length is 164 square

1132
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,740
about a million bacteria

1133
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,340
Of course you, you, after you add the medicine

1134
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,880
like this C8 week tone

1135
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160
This is one of the cephalospoins we just talked about

1136
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,760
After adding an anti-trace element

1137
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,960
you fight bacterial infections

1138
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,960
On the second day, most normal people and 90% of patients

1139
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,400
After two days of anti-trace treatment, you should be able to go home

1140
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,320
But if this patient

1141
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,560
he has other problems

1142
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,160
Or he's not fully healed

1143
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,400
he has to be taken inside the hospital

1144
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,560
So at this time they also went to study

1145
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,520
The bacteria in this patient are starting to change.

1146
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
why? just started you are

1147
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Sensitive to this drug

1148
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,960
can be cured

1149
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,120
At the beginning, if you are drug-resistant, MRSA

1150
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,800
if resistant

1151
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,320
The doctor said it's okay if it's resistant

1152
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,520
I use other drugs

1153
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,120
Several different drugs may be added

1154
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,920
After adding it to a week later

1155
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,160
If you can heal and go home, you'll be fine.

1156
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
If the body is still very bad

1157
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,320
At this time you will see all the strains

1158
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,960
Originally, only a small number of bacterial strains here were resistant to antibiotics.

1159
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,080
Here are all the strains are so-called MR

1160
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,840
Staphylococcus aureus

1161
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And the trees that spawned were originally from 1,000,000

1162
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Now change to 1000

1163
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
like trees come back again

1164
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
At this time, if you are not yet valid

1165
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Even if you still have to lie in the hospital

1166
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
this time you will use this

1167
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
venomoxin we passed

1168
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Basically the last line of defense

1169
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Then if it works at this time, it works

1170
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
if not valid

1171
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You have to stay in the patient for 20 days

1172
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
you at this time the drug

1173
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Basically this bacteria is a superbug

1174
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
so of course we

1175
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't think there will be any problems here

1176
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
that is to say

1177
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
why some people end up

1178
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
because some of the people he was very sick

1179
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
or he's clearly vulnerable

1180
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
chemotherapy patients

1181
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
or very elderly patients

1182
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
This one of his is clearly already fragile

1183
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So if you stay in the hospital for a long time at this time

1184
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Because the hospital you have been giving drugs

1185
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Those antioxidants are constantly mutated

1186
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
have that

1187
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,300
Opportunity to choose

1188
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,000
so what

1189
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,600
Finally, if you have been lying on the ice sheet,

1190
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,000
finally maybe basically

1191
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,400
All antibiotics are ineffective

1192
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,500
this is a very dire situation

1193
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,900
the other one

1194
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,100
when I introduce you

1195
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,500
This is also a statistical figure

1196
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,500
we can talk about this

1197
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,400
anticorrosion

1198
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,600
Continuing the fight against this infection

1199
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:20,900
do not stop

1200
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,600
why

1201
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,600
Because when we usually take antibiotics

1202
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,100
Usually we are very suspicious

1203
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,100
For example, today we

1204
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,900
doctor tell you

1205
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,600
You have an infection and you need antibiotics

1206
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,100
you have to eat for a week

1207
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,500
most people say

1208
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,600
I'll be fine in two or three days

1209
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,800
to help him with the refrigerator

1210
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,600
next time

1211
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,900
It can also be used when the infection is perfect

1212
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,500
No need to go to the doctor twice

1213
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,400
too wasteful

1214
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:40,800
that or

1215
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,700
sometimes you have side effects

1216
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,800
When taking antibiotics

1217
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,400
because you put your gut

1218
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,600
All intentions killed him

1219
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,400
you made him have diarrhea

1220
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,600
you develop other symptoms

1221
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,300
you are a doctor

1222
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,500
Then put the medicine back and stop

1223
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,600
It turned out

1224
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,700
have forgotten

1225
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,400
then it is not normal to use

1226
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,500
that actually increases the bacteria

1227
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,900
chance of survival

1228
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,800
In addition, generally we are on the feed of overtime acceleration

1229
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,000
Because sometimes you want high-density farming

1230
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,920
For example, you are in this pigsty

1231
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,520
Rarely able to raise 100 pigs

1232
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,520
But for high yield

1233
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,640
Suddenly raised 300 pigs

1234
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,920
So many creatures together can also get sick

1235
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,600
So some antibiotics are added to the feed

1236
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,200
it will not have bacterial infection

1237
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,320
This is the result of the actual same order

1238
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,240
The gray is darker than this bully

1239
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,680
It is the result of our use of cephalosporin

1240
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,680
The white words are found we say drug resistance

1241
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,840
golden cephalopod antibiotic resistant bacteria

1242
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,680
You can see that when we increase the amount of antibiotics

1243
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,440
You can see that after a year or two

1244
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,640
resistant bacteria

1245
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,080
It will also increase in number

1246
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,480
In other words, if you increase the amount of antibiotics used,

1247
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,560
As a result, you have an increased chance of finding resistance

1248
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,120
Then you put the amount of antibiotic

1249
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,600
lower slowly

1250
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,760
as a result you see

1251
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,120
Antibiotic bacteria are also slowly declining

1252
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,520
And you rise to he rises to

1253
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,320
For example, this is something like

1254
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,480
half water

1255
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,840
Say you take antibiotics

1256
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,360
Naturally there is Wu Wu's Xiangke

1257
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,240
Bacteria will find ways to get at you

1258
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,840
So the bacteria that can fight you will also increase with him

1259
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,520
It's half water

1260
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,560
So this life will never end

1261
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
This lets you understand

1262
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,120
Okay, I'm done thinking about this antibiotic.

1263
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,680
we pick up now

1264
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,680
to this diet pill

1265
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,240
what about diet pills

1266
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,000
our this

1267
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,480
This we call Anti-Obsert

1268
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,880
Obsert actually means fat

1269
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,840
that is

1270
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,880
i just said

1271
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,240
I mean we have obesity

1272
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,280
Of course it doesn't pose any threat to us

1273
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,480
Of course everyone wants to say

1274
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,640
There is no TV in this day and age

1275
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,440
everyone says

1276
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,480
I won't tell you how skinny this girl is

1277
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,040
Multiple aiming bars

1278
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,160
how fat is this girl

1279
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,280
How big is her size

1280
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,080
impossible

1281
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So generally speaking, if you carry a little

1282
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
If you can't do it with diet and exercise

1283
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Then we have to use drugs

1284
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
General weight-loss drugs probably cannot escape from these three functions

1285
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
This drug directly reduces your appetite

1286
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Make you not want to eat and make you feel full all the time

1287
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Otherwise it's altering your rookie's ability to metabolize

1288
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It means to let you, a newcomer, metabolize

1289
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
It was originally you, for example, after we are middle-aged

1290
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
If the newcomer's metabolism becomes low

1291
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It is very likely that after eating, everything will be easily tired in the body.

1292
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Increase the rate of your newcomer's metabolism

1293
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
or what you ate today

1294
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
If you don't absorb it, you won't let it out

1295
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
so change your appetite

1296
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Otherwise it is to increase the rate of your newcomer's metabolism

1297
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Otherwise, what you eat will not be absorbed

1298
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
these three

1299
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
so we say diet pills

1300
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Also known as We lost drop

1301
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
just let you eat

1302
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
sorry, drugs that make you lose weight

1303
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,060
Usually, you diet pills

1304
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,860
There will be instructions on it that say

1305
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,960
I hope you can keep your diet balanced and exercise

1306
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,500
he knows hope

1307
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,820
If your medicine is no joke, don't sue him

1308
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,640
Because do you have to pay attention to diet?

1309
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,440
Are you really exercising?

1310
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,240
If you don't do it, you can't sue him if he can do it

1311
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,560
There are currently two drugs

1312
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,340
a Zenicle

1313
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,880
That one is called Redactyl

1314
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,180
Then we call it screw fairy in Chinese

1315
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,720
then to make you cool

1316
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,180
Then there's Redactyl's falling beauty

1317
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,560
that you know

1318
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,880
The business of our drug is actually the same as the general one

1319
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,160
why?

1320
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,700
Look at this Zenicle

1321
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,980
It's called screw fairy

1322
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,900
But our troublesome Laninq in Taiwan

1323
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,820
Because of the name Zenicle

1324
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,640
You see it makes you cool, because it's cool to lose weight

1325
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,400
so what

1326
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,880
So I think the name of our Taiwan class

1327
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,740
Because this term is only used in Taiwan

1328
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,060
If you are in the general South China area, you still use the screw fairy

1329
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,080
that in addition

1330
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,360
Luo Meiting

1331
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
You have to speak Taiwanese, Luo Weiting

1332
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,500
If you eat your weight, you will lose weight

1333
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,140
This English is also very good

1334
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,480
Cause R-E-D-U-O-R-E-D-U-O

1335
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,940
It means lowering

1336
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,840
R-E-D-U-O-R-E-D-U-O

1337
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,720
So the naming is very interesting

1338
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,720
This is very knowledgeable

1339
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,580
Then let's talk about these two drugs to explain to you

1340
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,120
this Rochester

1341
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,220
Zenico, as I just mentioned, is a photo of Miku

1342
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,600
What about the drug?

1343
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,000
Rosh

1344
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,500
In most countries, he will do business and sales

1345
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,720
what about this drug

1346
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:32,620
found out

1347
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,920
they were in

1348
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,720
As I said just now, it means that the material is collected from nature.

1349
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
So he's in this kind of coal smelter

1350
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
Deposited Drugs

1351
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,020
Then you will see that this is the stored medicine

1352
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,020
Then this is the main ingredient of our later Zenico

1353
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,760
Then you'll see that the complete difference is

1354
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,900
This looks like it has two swords on it

1355
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,060
But generally speaking, this kind of double sword

1356
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,100
will be more unstable

1357
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:59,100
So they decided he reduced it to a saturated carbon chain

1358
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,100
so this is later

1359
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,600
Later, the more stable version is used in this Zeniko

1360
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,800
The main cost of this screw room

1361
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,560
what is it for

1362
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,000
How does it work?

1363
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,600
What they found was against us in Congyizang

1364
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,040
The Lipase secreted by Chris Yizang

1365
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,000
Is it the breakdown of fat?

1366
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,240
In other words, we usually eat mushrooms in the food

1367
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,560
start to be broken down in the digestive tract

1368
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,200
What if it's fat

1369
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,040
what about this time

1370
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,640
Usually need this lipolysis does not work

1371
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,440
It becomes small molecules of fat that will be absorbed by Xiaochang

1372
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,600
What if at this time

1373
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,800
you added drugs

1374
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,960
Can put this Lipase

1375
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,160
Suppress this N-RAN

1376
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,560
This N-RAN has no way to work

1377
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,680
So you'll find that says

1378
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,080
the fat you eat

1379
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,000
it won't be broken down

1380
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,960
will not be absorbed

1381
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,080
will be drained

1382
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,960
so what are its side effects

1383
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,360
just drain oil

1384
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,960
sorry press too fast

1385
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,200
will drain oil

1386
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,400
So the main side effect of this screw room

1387
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,360
everybody knows

1388
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,560
if you have eaten

1389
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,360
you will know say

1390
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,920
it causes disturbances in your intestines

1391
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,240
Then to the part that will let you pull the oil out

1392
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,040
Then I have friends who have eaten Ross Union

1393
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,240
I haven't eaten

1394
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,480
Although my weight is not very standard

1395
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,920
but that is to say

1396
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,680
I've heard that he sometimes

1397
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,520
It's just that you have to eat too normally

1398
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,980
Just follow the kitchen to eat

1399
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,360
you won't be able to get in

1400
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,000
will run up your pants

1401
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Because that oil is still too fast

1402
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,960
because usually we say sorry

1403
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,840
I'm talking nasty

1404
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,480
Let's defecate is going piece by piece

1405
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,920
that will be slower

1406
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,040
But because it was oily at that time

1407
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,080
So these substances will be discharged very smoothly

1408
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:35,680
so sometimes you don't

1409
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,520
No it's a side effect of a Manzao

1410
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,680
But it's okay

1411
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,520
That's because compared to the next words

1412
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,400
he is very good

1413
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,640
Rowe Hall

1414
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,960
What about the Rowe Hall?

1415
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,360
it's mostly about being aware of your appetite

1416
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,560
Then this problem will be more

1417
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,040
why

1418
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,440
Because it is mainly to target your

1419
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,280
Because there are some hormones in our body

1420
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,880
normal here

1421
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The reaction is really

1422
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
For example, our kidney adenoids

1423
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,800
and this

1424
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,000
Sterotonic it turns golden amine

1425
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,500
Or Dopamine Dopaamine

1426
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
These things are neurotransmitters

1427
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
that's in the body

1428
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,000
Its quantity is strictly controlled

1429
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
then these should

1430
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
these are

1431
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The main function of this Luo Meiting is

1432
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
When these neurotransmitters

1433
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
it recycles

1434
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,500
when recycle

1435
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,000
it holds it back

1436
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,500
So it turns into saying there are too many of these substances

1437
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500
so you can imagine

1438
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,000
The result of having too many of these neurotransmitters

1439
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
is to become

1440
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,500
You become very hyper

1441
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,500
you can't get in

1442
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
What about the result that you can't get in?

1443
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,000
Of course the first one will increase your sense of security

1444
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,500
But what?

1445
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,000
its main problem

1446
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
yes you will have a lot of problems

1447
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
your heart beats faster

1448
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
blood pressure rise

1449
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,500
because you can't get in

1450
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Then the half tongue is your dry mouth

1451
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,000
then bored with insomnia

1452
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Of course you're tired of death and insomnia

1453
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
people will lose weight

1454
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
But its problem is

1455
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
will let you

1456
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
your whole life

1457
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
make your life happy

1458
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,500
will be completely insomnia

1459
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
That is to say, in comparison with Luo Shixian just mentioned

1460
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,120
this will be more serious

1461
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,840
because it just regulates your hormones

1462
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,320
or regulate your neurotransmitters

1463
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,520
This is more serious

1464
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,480
In front of Luo Shixian, he asked you to guide him.

1465
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,800
Take a shower, you can use as much oil as possible

1466
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,280
In case it is wearing two pants

1467
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,440
three is ok

1468
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,800
That's the one that directly affects your daily life.

1469
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,480
that would be quite troublesome

1470
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,680
Then they also found out that

1471
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,240
because some people ate

1472
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,520
some cardiovascular diseases

1473
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,400
so what

1474
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,240
US Food and Drug Administration

1475
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,040
FDA

1476
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,160
It is food and drug administration

1477
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:36,880
Funding Pharmacology Continental Doctors

1478
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,600
because of the many reports

1479
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,280
So they were last year in 2001

1480
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,200
He just said he had a limit

1481
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,720
That is, people over the age of 65

1482
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,400
be careful when eating

1483
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,840
That's because of a lot of bad reports

1484
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,520
because of many side effects

1485
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,720
So Abe Pharmaceuticals in

1486
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,080
Because he had a warning from the FDA in August

1487
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,680
He will do his best in time

1488
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,640
Removed from the U.S. market

1489
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,340
Because this will lead to a lot of legal litigation issues

1490
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,500
they can't afford it

1491
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,040
So at the moment, although the silver quality sounds good

1492
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,640
Loviting

1493
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,040
But the problem is that his stock price may be as low as Lo Weiting

1494
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,940
So he finally had to quit

1495
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,980
Therefore, currently available diet pills

1496
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,840
And it's safer that Mr. Ross

1497
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,440
The next three to ask us are Welcom

1498
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,440
He Wergon's this

1499
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,440
Drug development is also very interesting

1500
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,440
Of course Wei Ergang, of course everyone, as the name suggests

1501
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,440
That is, he would tell us to make up for the dysfunction

1502
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,440
then why

1503
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,440
Because in fact, it didn’t mean that we must develop this

1504
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,440
Because I don't think pharmaceutical companies will develop this specifically

1505
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,440
No one has ever developed this sexual function before their disorder

1506
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,440
He's actually mostly at that Pfizer factory.

1507
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,440
Their lab over here in the UK

1508
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,440
They want this one for high blood pressure and heart and foot pain

1509
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,640
diseases for drug development

1510
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,600
Everyone knows

1511
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,640
Our blood pressure is regulated in many different ways

1512
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,640
one of them is

1513
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,080
due to constriction of blood vessels

1514
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,340
It directly affects blood pressure

1515
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,740
It's like today if a water pipe

1516
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,400
You press hard on your water pipe

1517
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,120
Of course the water pressure changes

1518
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,380
If the material of this water pipe

1519
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,040
To loosen or loosen the material

1520
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,240
the blood pressure will get worse

1521
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,080
So the idea was to say

1522
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,240
if i could develop a drug

1523
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,960
relax the muscles of the blood vessels

1524
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,360
lower blood pressure

1525
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,280
So they hoped to say

1526
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:40,480
Using the contraction or relaxation of this vascular muscle

1527
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,920
To treat high blood pressure and new foot pain

1528
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,920
Unexpectedly, it failed during the human experiment

1529
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,200
As a result, you will feel that doctors and nurses are very powerful

1530
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,880
Although failed

1531
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,760
But he noticed that

1532
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,600
Every one of these infectious patients will have thin gas

1533
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,680
Of course, if the nurse sees what he thinks

1534
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,760
maybe because i'm pretty

1535
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,200
Then this sushi patient reacted to me

1536
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,440
of course he is happy

1537
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,740
But this nurse I think he's the same as Felan

1538
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,700
also very careful

1539
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,680
He noticed that I might not look good

1540
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,200
Why every patient sees me like this

1541
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,400
So he went to report to Fighter

1542
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,800
Fighter must say this is a good thing

1543
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,340
So let's just not do that clinical test for high blood pressure.

1544
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,480
let's try

1545
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,340
Is it possible to win the above question?

1546
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,800
because it's the same

1547
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,500
These are also blood vessels to increase his blood flow

1548
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,100
So his blood flow on the air mass side can increase

1549
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,700
Just Arrive

1550
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,800
so what about the drug

1551
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,000
It's a drug that looks like this

1552
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,500
We think Syndana Fuel

1553
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,100
The most important thing I just said is

1554
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,500
We control the relaxation of blood vessels

1555
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
called Psychogenp

1556
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,400
Psychogenp mainly controls the drooping of blood vessels

1557
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,300
Then this Psychogenp has a decomposed effect number

1558
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,300
called PdE5

1559
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,500
This is called Fastal Diasdase

1560
00:56:59,500 --> 00:56:59,900
That is to say

1561
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
PsychoGNV breaks it down

1562
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,680
Then they found

1563
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,280
This Vahua this drug molecule

1564
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,280
to inhibit its decomposition effect

1565
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,780
just make it indestructible

1566
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,280
So it became more and more like this PsychoGNV

1567
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,680
So this PsychoGNV has been regulating

1568
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,880
Let this blood vessel relax and relax

1569
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,520
So it means that the blood flow keeps increasing

1570
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,520
That's certainly possible for the blood vessels of the heart

1571
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:24,060
Because it may be relatively thick, it may be difficult to get the effect

1572
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,160
But for the sexual organs, I think it's just right

1573
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,520
just happened to come across

1574
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,020
to relax the blood vessels

1575
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,020
then get engorged

1576
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,020
That's because of the result

1577
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,020
These three can get Nobel Prize

1578
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,020
But he didn't find Wei Erjiang

1579
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,020
don't know don't get me wrong

1580
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,020
Because finding Verjan is

1581
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,020
There are dozens and Werjiang

1582
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,020
Then why did they win the Nobel Prize?

1583
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,020
Because I just talked about this PsychoGNV

1584
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,020
it's a physiological process

1585
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,020
In fact we found that

1586
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,020
Nitrogen Oxide

1587
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,380
There is this small molecule Nitrogen Oxide

1588
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,880
it actually goes to our message

1589
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,740
This clause has a great function

1590
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,040
Then the last game is because of the discovery

1591
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,800
Same as Nature Outside

1592
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,600
seems to be about the whole biological process

1593
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,200
of course

1594
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,700
Of course, in addition to this new board

1595
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,900
It is also related to the Biohagra we just talked about

1596
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,700
So they got the Nobel Prize in 1998

1597
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,200
well that

1598
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,400
What about this Biohagra?

1599
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,300
let me tell you

1600
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,900
Although it was discovered by accident

1601
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,300
But it made Pfizer very profitable

1602
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,200
FDA passed it in 1998 and it can be sold

1603
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,300
Then you see it was only two years around 2000

1604
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,600
Its deferred sales have reached 1 billion US dollars

1605
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,700
a B chain

1606
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,000
That is equivalent to about ten billion Taiwan dollars.

1607
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,000
Then what

1608
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,900
How about in 2000?

1609
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,900
Vagra is the whole

1610
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,600
We say that in the global market

1611
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,100
sexual dysfunction

1612
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,700
it accounts for 92%

1613
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,200
But from 2000 to 2007, great changes

1614
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,000
what about this time

1615
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,400
I also just saw its sales drop by more than half

1616
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,000
why

1617
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
time for its success tax

1618
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,160
Other pharmacies later joined the development

1619
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,340
So this one called Celis's Cd4

1620
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,380
with another drug

1621
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,740
I don't know what the Chinese name is called Leventral

1622
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,140
These two drugs come to share this market

1623
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:10,660
so he

1624
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,460
and then what else

1625
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,420
Everyone knows this little blue ball

1626
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,260
so in many countries

1627
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,500
There are some for the production of medicine

1628
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,100
so what

1629
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,340
his

1630
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,060
Then another question he has is

1631
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:22,420
He's fat

1632
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,260
He is asking us to stuff a fat

1633
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,540
because you know

1634
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:25,580
already this medicine

1635
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:26,180
certainly

1636
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,340
because it is hope

1637
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,620
This drug our trust can

1638
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,380
he will

1639
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,220
against this other aspect of the vessel

1640
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,540
So there are also reports that

1641
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,060
Also has an effect on neovascular disease

1642
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:37,620
that's the pair of eyes

1643
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,140
because there are some

1644
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,740
For example, patients with diabetes mellitus

1645
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:40,660
his this

1646
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,100
ah

1647
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,860
That blood vessel in the retina is very fragile

1648
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,300
Then if you let him bleed

1649
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:47,620
If your eyes bleed

1650
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:49,420
often easily blind

1651
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,620
So these stuffed

1652
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,140
so let everyone

1653
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:52,660
for this

1654
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,940
Let the doctor take the medicine

1655
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,100
he will be more cautious

1656
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,140
will be replaced by other

1657
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,140
After talking about weight-loss pills and life-enhancing pills,

1658
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,760
Let's talk about cancer drugs first

1659
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,340
There are several anticancer drugs

1660
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:15,060
The five types I use here

1661
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,460
I just want to tell you

1662
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:19,980
In fact, the research and development of anticancer drugs has actually been going on for decades.

1663
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,300
R&D at the time was actually relatively non-selective

1664
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,640
Which means it's probably just cancer cells

1665
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,780
it grows faster than this cell

1666
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,660
if we say we kill

1667
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,380
The cancer cells will die more

1668
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,980
So people will talk about comparing non selective

1669
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,940
not selective

1670
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:38,340
Like this Wufu urinating to avoid illness and Shunbo

1671
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,180
I'll talk later

1672
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,980
Then compare selective therapy

1673
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,340
San Zhun

1674
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,260
Iris or Estin

1675
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,540
Look at this Abosting

1676
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,180
it's called cancer

1677
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,580
I'll stop thinking about it for myself

1678
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,180
it's fun to name something

1679
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,340
that said first

1680
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:55,180
these two

1681
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Uracial we call Uracial

1682
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
We call this symbol Fo

1683
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,500
This is a chemical therapy

1684
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,000
Basically it's just like normal Uracial

1685
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
The molecule of uridine is missing a Fo

1686
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Because usually we speak chemically

1687
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
The size of this Fo floating fat

1688
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
It's the same size as our pro

1689
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So if here

1690
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,500
if you take it as a waist

1691
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,500
may trick the enzymes on the body

1692
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,500
So this person means

1693
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:32,000
It is basically the same as our natural medicine

1694
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
So this was used very early

1695
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Chemotherapy used 40 years ago

1696
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
very primitive

1697
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So what I just said is that

1698
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Because IcBioxin is faster

1699
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,500
So it will take more of this medicine

1700
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,000
Then kill IcBioxin

1701
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,500
The main mode of action is to say

1702
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,500
When the genetic information of our human body

1703
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,000
When DNA is to be synthesized

1704
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
it will not be clear

1705
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,500
It thought it was its medicine

1706
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,500
just eat it in

1707
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,500
after eating

1708
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,000
It finds that it has no way to make a copy

1709
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So DNA replication stops

1710
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,720
The same reason is to say

1711
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,400
The iC package also has the normal C package

1712
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,120
it's not optional

1713
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,400
Just to say that the iC bag will grow faster

1714
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,840
Next is SysPlanetine

1715
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,560
just smooth

1716
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,200
why is it called shun

1717
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,200
It is Sys

1718
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,880
Mainly the chemical structure above

1719
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,920
its this

1720
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,080
This Lygon of the two

1721
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,360
Compounds are all on the same side

1722
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,080
we say Sys

1723
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:20,960
Shun Bo

1724
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,320
that's the same

1725
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,720
This is in the history of our chemotherapy

1726
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,280
The first one is very metallic

1727
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,720
especially if it is very thin

1728
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:28,440
i am platinum

1729
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,840
So this drug should be very expensive

1730
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,800
very valuable

1731
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,040
and platinum

1732
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,840
That

1733
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,000
then it mainly can of course

1734
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,040
Can be applied to a variety of cancers

1735
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,160
So here's a talk about meat flow

1736
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,600
or a tumor

1737
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,280
or impending cancer

1738
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,160
There are knots

1739
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,040
that same

1740
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,880
The drug ran into the DNA

1741
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,000
it will happen

1742
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,200
What we call ENA

1743
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:48,840
Costing

1744
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,320
it's called cross join

1745
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,640
It's like it's sticky

1746
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,640
It's like when DNA replicates

1747
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,520
it's the result of it being sticky

1748
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,840
inhibit the replication of its DNA

1749
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,160
So with its genetic message

1750
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So as a result of this the cell dies easily

1751
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But his worse result is that he used it for a long time

1752
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
if you reply

1753
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
the patient will

1754
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Your tumor will be drug resistant anyway

1755
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So when this medicine has been used for a while

1756
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
If unfortunately relapse

1757
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
you have to take other medicine

1758
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So it looks like it's time for cancer treatment

1759
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The doctor should pay close attention

1760
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
the patient's response to the drug

1761
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
if the reaction is bad

1762
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Or when there is drug resistance, change it as soon as possible

1763
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Otherwise there is always

1764
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
actually grows very fast

1765
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
but no time to wait for him

1766
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Those first two are not optional

1767
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
i just said

1768
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Both normal and cancer cells actually eat it

1769
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But these drugs

1770
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
is more selective

1771
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
like paclitaxel

1772
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Taisheng

1773
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,000
called TACSO

1774
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
you see its tacso

1775
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
This name is very knowledgeable

1776
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Why is it called purple triol?

1777
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
because mainly in the 60s

1778
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
he found in the pacific

1779
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
This is the West Coast of the United States

1780
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
His entertainment is in the United States

1781
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Northern Oregon

1782
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Washington over there

1783
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,500
There are many redwood mountains along their coasts

1784
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,300
Redwood Mountain they call Pacific Purple Mountain

1785
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:12,500
Experienced from within his bark

1786
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Because of the Pacific Purple Mountain

1787
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,500
Because the purple mountain that came out was stupid

1788
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,000
This drug is actually very famous

1789
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,500
Why? Because Zishan is stupid mainly to suppress this

1790
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:27,500
because when the cell is about to replicate again,

1791
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,000
it will do a wet split

1792
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,500
when wet split

1793
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,500
Sales Galenton start above their casing

1794
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,000
It is to make some insect groups on the surrounding pipes

1795
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,500
It is mainly when the worm group around the tube

1796
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
hold back in the process

1797
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
So this comparison Selective

1798
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,500
Why? Because the packet splitting will become faster

1799
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
So if you can suppress this

1800
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,500
The Sambler that surrounds the pipe

1801
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:57,000
effectively inhibit the cancer cells

1802
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,500
This purple mountain idiot is actually very interesting

1803
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,240
In the United States, they spent a lot of manpower on the development

1804
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,960
at that time

1805
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,800
at this

1806
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,760
there are some pharmaceutical factories

1807
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,440
they actually do

1808
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:08,440
already started to do

1809
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,200
measure a little time

1810
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,240
you have to notice

1811
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,040
This is Supi

1812
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,240
You can't just cut off all the plain skin on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean

1813
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,480
Supi get it Supi

1814
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,240
that is

1815
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,200
because they found out that it might be

1816
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,400
Supi may only cure a few diseases

1817
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,720
So they then went to find some way

1818
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,520
able to mass produce this molecule

1819
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,360
You see this molecule is very complex

1820
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,760
That just so happens that we are in Taiwan

1821
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,520
all 20 years ago

1822
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,560
Yong Feng in this company

1823
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,760
He actually wants to do BioTek

1824
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,400
I think Wang Shuyuan, if someone has

1825
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,160
should know the process

1826
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,800
They sent a professor from Taiwan

1827
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,600
to follow

1828
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,880
want to go

1829
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,000
Get this Technology

1830
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,600
used to take

1831
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,800
i don't know how to get it

1832
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,000
but

1833
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,760
just bad luck

1834
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,800
Just got caught by the FBI

1835
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,000
buy line

1836
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Just got caught

1837
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,200
So they had some legal action at the time

1838
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,480
so the professor

1839
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,960
lived there for a while

1840
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,920
to come back

1841
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,760
This is some biotechnology

1842
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,000
Know-how in biotechnology is actually very important

1843
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,920
Because you originally had to get out of the plain skin

1844
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,140
Then how do you go about mass producing this next?

1845
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,520
actually a big problem

1846
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,560
like we were watching this

1847
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,760
Pan Lin's New Year mass production is the same

1848
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,400
That's a very important technology

1849
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,200
Well then it's IRISA

1850
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,220
IRIS

1851
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,760
What about IRISA?

1852
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,560
In fact, the main role is in this

1853
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,120
epithelial growth factor

1854
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,640
Then this IRISA is actually very famous

1855
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,200
Especially in dealing with this lung cancer

1856
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,240
Then why is it for

1857
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,800
We say the receptor for epithelial growth factor

1858
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:37,360
We say we say EGFR

1859
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,920
Epidermal

1860
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,440
Gross Factor Receptor

1861
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,460
that means

1862
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,760
In general, many processes in our body

1863
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,560
including the replication of its cells

1864
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,840
are subject to this signal

1865
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,600
inside the signal

1866
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:53,240
Let's say it has a message delivery event

1867
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,560
one of them is

1868
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,840
epithelial growth factor

1869
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,860
That

1870
01:06:57,860 --> 01:06:59,900
Ic cell, if it can grow rapidly

1871
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,600
So his messaging will be very strong

1872
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,720
So IRISA is one of the

1873
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,840
It's like a drug

1874
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,540
which puts a very important message

1875
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:11,260
let him pass the message

1876
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,600
There is no way to transfer smoothly

1877
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,600
so beijing says

1878
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,100
After he inhibited this EGFR

1879
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,800
After this epidermal growth factor

1880
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,600
After acceptor

1881
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,000
let this cancer cell

1882
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,700
no way

1883
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,100
because he needed information

1884
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,200
message received

1885
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,800
This cancer cell is able to grow

1886
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,100
to be able to transfer

1887
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:29,400
Even more severe drug resistance

1888
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:32,900
Then you once you pass this message on the way

1889
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,400
block it later

1890
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,600
Cancer cells cannot continue to grow

1891
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,700
continue to transfer

1892
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:39,700
So this is a

1893
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,400
For now

1894
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,400
Our very effective anti-cancer drug

1895
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,000
And then there's Albostin

1896
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,900
This cancer wet court

1897
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:51,400
Then this Albostin and the previous drugs

1898
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,000
no the same

1899
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,500
because it is not a drug molecule

1900
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,600
Rather it is a

1901
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,100
What we call a monoclonal antibody

1902
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,500
a big protein

1903
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,200
This Humanized Monoclonal Antibody

1904
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,600
is a monoclonal antibody

1905
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,200
then it is mainly

1906
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,500
We are primarily conscious in our

1907
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,500
What we call Angiogenesis is angiogenesis

1908
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,000
that is, cancer cells

1909
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
If it grows fast today

1910
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,500
it has to keep growing

1911
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,000
or even say it's going somewhere else

1912
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,500
when cancer cells are about to grow

1913
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,500
Must be a lot of nutrients in the apartment

1914
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,700
like a baby growing up

1915
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,500
It must drink milk non-stop every day

1916
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,500
cancer cells too

1917
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,300
So it must distinguish some factors

1918
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,000
Let nearby capillaries escape

1919
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,800
Then it's like adding the oil pipe in

1920
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,100
provide it with nutrients

1921
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,100
We call this process consanguinity

1922
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:40,500
Angiogenesis is called Angiogenesis

1923
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
that process is very important

1924
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,700
then we are now

1925
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,300
They just discovered that using this monoclonal antibody

1926
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,300
able to put this

1927
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:50,800
Regulate the branch of its bloodline generation

1928
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
This process blocks it

1929
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,800
So it is equal to the cancer wet body, the drug

1930
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,100
can make this cancer cell able to

1931
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,600
stop growing up at least

1932
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,360
So usually it can be used with other chemotherapy

1933
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,360
Then it means that it may allow cancer cells to control the

1934
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,000
let it grow

1935
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,200
that can be combined with other anticancer drugs

1936
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,840
let it go on let it die

1937
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,900
What if the drug is unfortunate?

1938
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,900
Also at the end of last year

1939
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:21,240
The FDA found that

1940
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,360
This drug is actually for the metastasis of cancer cells

1941
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,280
completely gone

1942
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:26,960
no obvious curative effect

1943
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,520
So the FDA said last year

1944
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:32,680
Abosting is best not used to treat this metastatic cancer

1945
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,080
Then of course you can use

1946
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,160
This if cancer cells

1947
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,520
It can be used if it is swollen cancer

1948
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,960
but for

1949
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,420
That is, cancers that can metastasize malignantly have no obvious curative effect

1950
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:46,520
A big hit for this company

1951
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,120
They target cancer cell metastasis

1952
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,280
It was found to be inactive

1953
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,280
so cancer wet court

1954
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,520
So cancer shouldn't stop

1955
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,480
cancer can't stop

1956
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,240
OK, let's talk about

1957
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,160
that's not stethamine

1958
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,300
it's basically this

1959
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,100
we are all a sugar

1960
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:10,900
this sugar

1961
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,640
What about glucosamine?

1962
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,840
Basically it's inside our body

1963
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,740
Chondroitin

1964
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,240
We say chondroitin

1965
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,340
In which connective tissue are we generally

1966
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,240
This cartilage between the bone and the heel bone

1967
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,740
is to make it an important ingredient

1968
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:23,640
so because we say

1969
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,800
Glucosamine is important

1970
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,740
Say if the bones are bad

1971
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,640
Said that the joints are not good, you need to eat glucosamine

1972
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,100
Let me tell you about it

1973
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,000
your

1974
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,040
that is

1975
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:32,840
Glucosamine

1976
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,340
It has nothing to do with calcium

1977
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:36,000
Because glucosamine it is a

1978
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,500
a monosaccharide molecule

1979
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,200
Calcium is a mineral

1980
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,300
is something different

1981
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,600
Then everyone knows that is to say

1982
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,200
It means that if you eat today

1983
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:43,740
Glucosamine

1984
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,000
because it is in our body

1985
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,100
You are going to synthesize this

1986
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,100
cartilage time

1987
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,740
it's just a raw material

1988
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:50,300
Raw material only

1989
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,140
so you eat more

1990
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,040
It can make your cartilage grow more

1991
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,300
That is to say, it should be outside of your growth rate

1992
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:56,900
because of U.S

1993
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,440
Generally speaking, patients with joints

1994
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,400
we are getting older

1995
01:10:59,400 --> 01:10:59,900
etc.

1996
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,340
The formation and decomposition of cartilage must be balanced

1997
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:09,140
Therefore, more raw materials must be added

1998
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:14,640
Let it grow and decompose a little bit in balance

1999
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,340
So we say Prolana is a healthy food

2000
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,760
English is called Dietary Supplement

2001
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,860
words also spoken in the United States

2002
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,860
besides vitamins

2003
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:25,760
except for minerals

2004
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,500
It is one of the most commonly used a health food

2005
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,860
The second one is pineapple acid

2006
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:34,800
it is also a sugar

2007
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,800
Bromelain is a monosaccharide

2008
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,360
That pineapple acid is a polysaccharide

2009
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,540
In fact, this polysaccharide

2010
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,000
It is a regular polysaccharide

2011
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,960
because its repeating unit is a disaccharide

2012
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,560
that one is called what we think

2013
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,040
gluconic acid

2014
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,640
That's another case of glucose

2015
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,140
This is equivalent to a disaccharide

2016
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:55,100
Then you see

2017
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,380
What's interesting about this molecule above is that

2018
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,980
it has a lot of skin charge

2019
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,160
So because of the repulsion the malleability of this molecule is very good

2020
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,560
And it has a lot of guns that can work with water

2021
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,440
So what's interesting about this molecule is that it stretches very high

2022
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,840
will become sticky

2023
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,260
In addition, its water and ability are very good

2024
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,120
so moisturizing

2025
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,040
So it is equal to the pot why uric acid is often used in cosmetics

2026
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,040
There is nothing wrong with the effect of moisturizing

2027
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,540
ad didn't lie to you

2028
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:29,080
Then I just said that these pots of uric acid are also present in our body.

2029
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,440
That's usually used in our energy-saving organizations

2030
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,240
There is also so much uric acid on the epidermis and nerve tissue

2031
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,280
That's about a normal person weighing 70 kg

2032
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,600
About 15 grams of pot uric acid

2033
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:44,080
That in pot uric acid supremacy is currently recognized

2034
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,580
I mean, if you say we have joint problems

2035
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,280
especially the knee

2036
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,840
You can directly apply the pot of uric acid

2037
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,600
because it is aimed at osteoarthritis patients

2038
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,680
it is there

2039
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,880
Didn't mention your osteoarthritis patient

2040
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,280
There is a problem with uric acid in this cartilage pot

2041
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,880
After the beating, let its substance be

2042
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,020
don't wear out too fast

2043
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:02,020
Because this cartilage is

2044
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,580
Numbing agent between bones

2045
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,860
If you don't have that substance

2046
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,660
direct bone-to-bone contact

2047
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:07,160
that's like

2048
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:08,700
have an effect on bone and joint function

2049
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:09,720
That

2050
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:12,280
This is in addition to the treatment of bone and joint function

2051
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,060
usually

2052
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,080
Osteonasic acid can also

2053
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,380
I just said that it is used in cosmetics

2054
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:20,220
And the FDA US Food and Drug Administration in 2003

2055
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:20,980
he also said

2056
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,020
if we say

2057
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:25,100
If an older person wants to remove wrinkles

2058
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:26,880
Then you can directly administer osteosarcin

2059
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,420
Because just said he has moisturizing

2060
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,480
It's good to keep his ductility

2061
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,520
So it is equivalent to filling wrinkles

2062
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:33,540
Facial wrinkle

2063
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,820
So this is

2064
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,100
his output is very large

2065
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,120
that you know

2066
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,920
Osteonasic acid

2067
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,480
inside to grow

2068
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:44,040
Because it is the organ that allows the attack to contain

2069
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,320
very high

2070
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,360
It just so happens that few people eat organs, right?

2071
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:48,380
in often few people

2072
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,660
so before

2073
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,500
Osteonasic acid is separated from this organ

2074
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,540
that now yields

2075
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:55,820
too much demand

2076
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:57,860
So there are other ways to do production

2077
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Okay, that's over. Just now.

2078
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Our weight loss pills, I also just talked about other than health products

2079
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Let's talk about painkillers now

2080
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
There is also a very interesting story in the painkiller

2081
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
For example, we will talk about R-Spinning, how to find

2082
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
What additional benefits does it have

2083
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
it has some disadvantages

2084
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But what we're going to talk about here is

2085
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Other than R-Spinning

2086
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Now you see in your daily life

2087
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
For example, this is called this place

2088
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
In fact, it is Pronatex

2089
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
You saw in the report a few days ago that

2090
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Children who eat too much Puna pain will affect their health

2091
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
This is Puna pain

2092
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Then there is IP-Profan

2093
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
In addition, we will talk about some Costone

2094
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
What is Costone, people will listen to you to explain

2095
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
R-Spinning is also an old drug

2096
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
in fact its history

2097
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
was launched in 1899

2098
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
The pan energy that I talked about at the beginning of today will last longer

2099
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
that aspirin

2100
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
That's because it's a direct translation of aspirin

2101
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Then his official name is

2102
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
acetylcytocacyl

2103
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So you guys are saying this is a

2104
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Acetylated salicylic acid

2105
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
if this point

2106
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
If it's not here, it's a salicylic acid

2107
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
usually we say

2108
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
This drug has three types

2109
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Why is this medicine so good?

2110
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
because it has many good activities

2111
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
first it can relieve pain

2112
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
it's antipyretic it's anti-inflammatory

2113
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Then we'll explain why it

2114
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
There will also be this

2115
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
That is to say, an inflammatory reaction process of the body

2116
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Notifies you when your body is emotional

2117
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So tell the body it will take the body temperature

2118
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
slightly higher

2119
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
let your body react

2120
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
will get faster

2121
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
That's because of your excessive inflammation.

2122
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
make your body look like it's not

2123
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
So you must take this spoonful of medicine

2124
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
play out the process

2125
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
That history is very long

2126
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
because it was in BC

2127
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
three or four hundred years ago

2128
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
there is such a record

2129
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Why because at the time they made the willow bark

2130
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
to experience

2131
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
What about the experience from inside the bark?

2132
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
found that it can directly relieve pain

2133
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,800
And it can be said to be the pain when I was a child

2134
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,700
Pain relief with tree bark extract

2135
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,600
This is the record of the Greeks

2136
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:16,000
The later record is that until 1875

2137
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,900
What about the end of the 1970s?

2138
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,400
They discovered that this salicylic acid

2139
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,000
Our name is Sodium Cylite

2140
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,200
That's actually the one without the part

2141
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:25,900
It's the acid part.

2142
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,000
In fact at that time it was using

2143
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,900
As far as the end of 1875 and 1970

2144
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,700
That's just saying salicylic acid has some side effects

2145
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,100
we'll get to that later

2146
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,500
The fact that the invention in Aspirin was actually made by this man

2147
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,400
is in Bayer Germany

2148
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,200
The basis of their chemistry in Germany is very

2149
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:45,300
Then their chemist was Felix Hopmann

2150
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:49,000
Well, in fact, his father, because of the joint

2151
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,900
Always eat that salicylic acid

2152
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:53,500
But he complained to his son

2153
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,100
I take this salicylic acid

2154
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,800
There are often crashes

2155
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,100
And that is waiting

2156
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,700
Our so-called kelp acid is from Lugulin

2157
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,500
some wounds inside the body

2158
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,440
often unpredictable

2159
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,640
so always with him

2160
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,540
his child

2161
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:06,940
He said you work in a pharmacy

2162
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,080
Then you will do chemistry again

2163
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,180
why doesn't he

2164
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,280
hold on let me out

2165
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:11,880
The results of it

2166
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,980
His son really took acid from this water

2167
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,080
to do all kinds of chemistry

2168
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,680
did some lalama baba test

2169
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,160
so this is our first

2170
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,560
one in history

2171
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,060
human experiment

2172
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,760
Just try him out

2173
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,760
That's a good thing he has good chemistry skills.

2174
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,700
they have some

2175
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,660
Some

2176
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,000
It's the medicine my student made for me

2177
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,760
I dare not eat

2178
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,520
Why

2179
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Then in case there are some impurities

2180
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,720
eat it, i'm busy

2181
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,760
that's the end

2182
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,100
so let his chemistry skills not bad

2183
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,360
he eats

2184
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,700
turn out

2185
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:41,800
Added this acetylipop

2186
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:42,960
westernized place

2187
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,200
the result is very good

2188
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,340
so later

2189
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,000
this pharmaceutical factory

2190
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,340
their beyer company

2191
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,600
decided to put this

2192
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,300
Originally they were producing salicylic acid

2193
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,040
salicylic acid

2194
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,580
This is our ASPY today

2195
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,940
However, this story has also been overturned

2196
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:58,780
why

2197
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:00,000
because at that time they said

2198
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Germany was later contested by the Nazis

2199
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,320
they were german

2200
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:04,800
because later one

2201
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,800
this

2202
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,360
Jewish chemist

2203
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,720
They said it was his invention

2204
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,720
It was because the Nazis ruled at that time

2205
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,240
He made up a story that

2206
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,000
There is a very filial chemist

2207
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,600
Because he is filial to his father, he will make it

2208
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,360
I'm not a historian

2209
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,400
i can't go

2210
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,000
Say which one is right and both are wrong

2211
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,440
But the name of Aspirinde is also very famous

2212
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,160
A

2213
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:25,360
he's mostly talking

2214
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,720
Because he Westernized this salicylic acid

2215
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,720
THE SIEGE

2216
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,280
S-P-I-R-I-N

2217
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,280
this is mainly

2218
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,760
he was in

2219
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:35,880
In this 19th century

2220
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:38,720
experience from this plant

2221
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:39,760
the name of the plant

2222
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,680
Then there is S-PRIM

2223
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,080
and this source

2224
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,960
So I just said 1899

2225
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,680
What about Bayer?

2226
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,560
Just put this on the market

2227
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,080
That's what they did in 1999 AD

2228
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,280
100 years later they have statistics

2229
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,480
Currently the most used medicine bowl in the world

2230
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,000
He seems to have used over a billion medicine bowls

2231
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Then you'll see this ad from 1923

2232
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
you see migrant

2233
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
The name means neuralgia

2234
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
this is german

2235
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
migrant this is arthritis

2236
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
rheumatoid arthritis

2237
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
matoioasuritis

2238
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
You said ASPINE's medicine at that time

2239
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Because of this related series Perish

2240
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It is an advertisement of ASPINE in Europe

2241
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
it can be trained to cure bottle headaches

2242
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
neuralgia and joint pain

2243
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Why does it have pain relief in ASPINE

2244
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Antipyretic and anti-inflammatory

2245
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
inside our body

2246
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
To initiate an inflammatory response like this

2247
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
In fact, it is made of our fat

2248
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
There is a four double sword

2249
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
We say Tetraximic Acid

2250
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Arachidonic acid

2251
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
It is a twenty carbon fatty acid

2252
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
start here

2253
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
to do some metabolic reactions

2254
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
what about here

2255
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
The first very important reaction is the itching reaction

2256
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
What we call sychroactogenase

2257
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
For example, the itching reaction starts

2258
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Generate this Perish

2259
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Perish we call prostaglandins

2260
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,120
So why is it called Postagranding

2261
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,560
That has nothing to do with the prostate

2262
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,400
That is to say, this series of reactions of the body

2263
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,920
We call this an inflammatory response

2264
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,760
That just happens to be this Aspirin or what we'll talk about later

2265
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,440
this other pain medication

2266
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,960
are all acting on this Cox

2267
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:20,320
That is to say, this epoxidation enzyme

2268
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,960
Cox1 1 2

2269
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,000
so it blocks it

2270
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,920
equal to the following molecules

2271
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,880
It's actually all about regulating our inflammatory response.

2272
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,560
For example, it will be excruciating

2273
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,960
With this, the body temperature can be raised

2274
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,320
Then what

2275
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,120
Inflammation of these molecules can no longer be produced

2276
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,080
So it's like shutting it down from the source

2277
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,880
So we say its main purpose is to control the inflammatory response

2278
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:48,760
Mainly this Enzyme

2279
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,400
That is to say Cox

2280
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,960
I just mentioned

2281
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,400
it you turn off the principle

2282
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,800
So the latter

2283
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,040
prostaglandins

2284
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,680
This is not just a single Compound

2285
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,400
Prostaglandin and blood cream

2286
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,120
Dipamine

2287
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,600
These molecules are all related to the inflammatory response

2288
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,000
regulate these physiological responses

2289
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,200
just turn it all off

2290
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:14,200
And the front line counts it's actually a hormone

2291
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:17,900
In physiology, it is to transmit the pain sensation to the brain

2292
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,300
So it's time to say you have a painful inflammatory reaction today

2293
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,000
Excessive inflammation makes your physiological response not

2294
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,400
So you have to use painkillers to shut this source down

2295
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:33,500
Then this aspirin is a miracle drug

2296
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:37,400
So at the time it meant that even though I didn't know anything in 1940

2297
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,500
It is equivalent to listing it in 1899

2298
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,200
But his physical

2299
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,900
His entire passport is about why he can have such a magical effect

2300
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:50,800
This perfectly explained until the 1950s by Gang Dan

2301
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,400
He clarified this Maconian with his technology

2302
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,900
So in 1982 he and two other

2303
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,000
I believe they should be Swedish chemistry

2304
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,640
Shared Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Semmelson

2305
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,160
got it in 1982

2306
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,500
In addition, aspirin is constantly

2307
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,780
because he is a magic molecule

2308
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,060
Although Li Tong You Jiu

2309
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,360
He doesn't just have pain relief

2310
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:16,640
he has other

2311
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,660
most importantly

2312
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:22,520
You can avoid it if you don't take low dose aspirin for a day

2313
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:24,060
Heavy wind heels

2314
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,880
Hard Attack

2315
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,440
on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease

2316
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,000
And they are experimentally confirmed

2317
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:37,380
Taiwan is relatively rare. If you go to the United States, you will see what they call Low Dose aspirin

2318
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:44,800
Generally, aspirin can be 50 or 80mm

2319
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,180
What do we say Primary

2320
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,000
Primary prevention is secondary prevention

2321
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,040
for these people

2322
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,340
He has absolutely no history of cardiovascular disease

2323
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,860
His heart was completely fine before

2324
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,340
They found that he reduced cardiovascular disease by about a tenth

2325
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:07,740
For him, if he has had a stroke and has a background of cardiovascular disease

2326
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:11,140
If he has some cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction

2327
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:14,040
If you take low doses of RSP daily

2328
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,660
He can also reduce the recurrence rate by 10%

2329
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:19,720
So this effect is quite significant

2330
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:22,420
So generally speaking, they will recommend you for a day

2331
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,720
Yours can eat about 40 to 80 mini light is enough

2332
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,020
can have such a preventive effect

2333
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:32,020
So this is RSP and of course RSP has some problems

2334
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:36,520
It's just that at the beginning we said that it actually causes some side effects

2335
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,520
Those side effects include children can not eat

2336
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,520
may cause budding syndrome

2337
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:43,520
RSP he will cause you some itchy problems

2338
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,520
Although this Hopman he solves his dad's problem

2339
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,020
But in fact, he still has the problem of itching after taking it for a long time.

2340
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,520
Why do people explain

2341
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,520
So, they started looking for some other alternative medicine

2342
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520
Those alternative medicines include RSP

2343
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,520
non-inflammatory anti-inflammatory drugs

2344
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,520
We call it NSP

2345
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
NSAID

2346
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,300
so why? because

2347
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,300
Steroid

2348
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,800
Just mentioned those Postacans

2349
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,000
Steroid itself

2350
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,400
Steroid itself is an anti-inflammatory drug

2351
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:10,700
we say it is

2352
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:13,500
But Steroid has serious side effects

2353
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,000
So what we usually do is a

2354
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,400
Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

2355
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,000
on NSAIDs

2356
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,500
the first one

2357
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,200
It is also famous in history

2358
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:22,800
Print paper

2359
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,200
就Aslamino fan

2360
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,400
touch light or

2361
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,200
Or in the US we call it Tan

2362
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,800
Known as Panagl in Taiwan

2363
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,100
It's paper

2364
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:33,500
It was on the market in the United States as early as 1953

2365
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,300
that they now think

2366
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:38,300
Because of the fact that it has sold more than RSP

2367
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,300
And usually we say

2368
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,700
This is a T token of RSP

2369
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,600
that this

2370
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,600
what about the painkiller

2371
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,800
it actually

2372
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,900
you can now in

2373
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,600
available in general medicines

2374
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,900
You can buy beyond ingredients

2375
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,700
and it works really fast

2376
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:53,900
because after you take

2377
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:55,800
It takes about 11 minutes to have an analgesic effect

2378
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,000
but very good

2379
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,300
and it won't hurt the taste

2380
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:58,900
what about the other

2381
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,100
its something on the upgrade side

2382
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,460
About one to four hours

2383
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:08,240
Then I just said that after the 1980s

2384
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,700
Its sales volume has surpassed that of RSP

2385
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,540
So the effect of Pronison is very good

2386
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,340
what about the other

2387
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:14,960
its

2388
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,240
Why was it called Tanel in the first place?

2389
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,240
mainly because they found

2390
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,740
They also Campaign means

2391
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,600
it is small

2392
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,760
Just talked about RSP

2393
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,840
Children are usually not allowed to use

2394
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,600
so they are

2395
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,300
This is the drug they started giving to the little ones

2396
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,300
Tanel Children's Extra

2397
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:32,000
That

2398
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,000
I really don't want to talk about its discovery

2399
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:34,960
time relationship

2400
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,760
almost time

2401
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:37,700
I have to speed up a little bit

2402
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,200
What about IP ProFan?

2403
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,200
in what we call

2404
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,100
Generally we call it ADV and there is a New Print

2405
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,700
What about the initial development?

2406
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:46,700
Mainly in England there is a science called Steward Eddons

2407
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,700
Adams

2408
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,300
He was looking for a drug

2409
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,600
able to treat him with this

2410
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,500
the old one

2411
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,500
Handover problem

2412
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,600
don't know how to speak english

2413
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:56,100
that is

2414
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:56,860
that

2415
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,960
hangover problem

2416
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,920
Unexpectedly, this medicine turned out to be

2417
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,940
No tax but the problem is it can have a painkiller effect

2418
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,700
So the effect is also very good

2419
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,500
Then this is a case of immediate selectivity

2420
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,940
In terms of time, I'll jump over first

2421
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,240
so-called selective painkillers

2422
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:13,960
just now

2423
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:16,540
In our inflammatory response PASS

2424
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,400
Cox that NZ

2425
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,700
In fact it comes in two different forms

2426
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:22,200
We use Cox1, Cox2

2427
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,500
Cox1 is ubiquitous

2428
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:26,700
In fact it can protect you

2429
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,300
The inside story of your provocation

2430
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,260
so if you hold it back

2431
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:32,260
it has no way to protect

2432
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,140
so you get ulcers easily

2433
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:37,900
So Cox2 is when the inflammatory response

2434
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,960
will be activated

2435
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:39,760
So usually speaking

2436
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,220
We say like R-Speed-In

2437
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:44,400
Usually it suppresses both

2438
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,000
so we are not good

2439
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,360
We say that after taking this medicine

2440
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,500
Although it can relieve pain

2441
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,900
But when reactivating for a long time

2442
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,400
would be tantamount to destroying your consumption

2443
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,960
consume these mucous membranes

2444
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,260
is to reactivate

2445
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,260
so it becomes saying

2446
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:55,760
At that time they thought that

2447
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,300
Afraid to discover that there are these two different forms

2448
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,100
Then my medicine for the next generation

2449
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,440
Drugs must be suppressed

2450
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,680
Cox2 cannot inhibit Cox1

2451
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,200
generally

2452
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:05,960
but in fact

2453
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,440
There is a problem

2454
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:09,840
because

2455
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,720
One of the two major pharmaceutical companies in the United States is

2456
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,240
Merck one is Pfizer

2457
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:13,840
Bison

2458
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,480
they went to find the so-called

2459
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,280
because I just said I can't

2460
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:17,880
need

2461
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,640
Cox2 to be selective

2462
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:21,120
Doubtful Fox2

2463
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,000
It started off fine

2464
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,800
Since it was launched in 1999

2465
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,800
then the most recent thing

2466
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,400
But later found out that

2467
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:28,560
Why

2468
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,000
have side effects

2469
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,000
Then there's a lot of legal action

2470
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,560
So listed in 1999

2471
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,400
So in 2004 when

2472
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,600
Merck had to take him off the shelves automatically

2473
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:38,960
That's what people can see

2474
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:41,360
2007 before they were taken off the shelves

2475
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,640
this number may

2476
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,560
may be a problem

2477
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,160
This number may not be 2007 either

2478
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,440
It was in 2001

2479
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,200
his total

2480
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:54,360
This can be sold for two hundred million dollars every year

2481
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,000
so he

2482
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,160
Equal to the history of mankind

2483
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:57,720
put this

2484
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,320
very large sales

2485
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,040
First off

2486
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
is this virus

2487
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
then they have two versions

2488
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
pharmaceutical factory is talking

2489
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
just talking about this world

2490
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
did notice this

2491
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
The risk of vascular disease

2492
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
But our person is the experimental card

2493
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Of course the manuscript is here

2494
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
The patient told the pharmaceutical company that

2495
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
You are deliberately concealing your clinical

2496
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So this is a bit of an argument

2497
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
what about the other one

2498
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
It's this gray hot pharmaceutical factory

2499
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
What about his medication?

2500
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Must be taken as directed by a physician

2501
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
His sales that year turned out to be 3 billion US dollars

2502
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Then what I just said

2503
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
After the removal of the Morke drug

2504
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
What about his medicine because it's not off the shelf?

2505
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
so recover slowly

2506
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
2 billion US dollars by 2006

2507
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
So there is still some controversy over this drug.

2508
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Because everyone thinks there are still some

2509
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
must be under control

2510
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
use under strict supervision

2511
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
i think i'm each for a while

2512
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
ok let me tell you this

2513
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,400
Killing Bean Wheat

2514
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,960
This drug was developed in the 1950s

2515
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,760
At that time, he believed that there was a promotional effect

2516
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,960
And for this like a pregnant woman

2517
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,360
when he has haematological symptoms

2518
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,960
He can stop vomiting

2519
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,840
So this time is equal to

2520
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:16,800
Pregnant women because there is such a magic drug

2521
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,000
Because it has some anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects

2522
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And there will be antiemetic

2523
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,960
So become a lot of pregnant women

2524
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,840
within that time period

2525
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,160
That is to say, everyone is equal to

2526
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,960
Because blood is very

2527
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,760
that is to say it is a difficult

2528
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,160
very uncomfortable symptoms

2529
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,360
So it becomes a saying that pregnant women should take it

2530
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,560
But the problem was discovered later

2531
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,000
The child's birth deformity

2532
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,400
Look at the soles of this child's feet

2533
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,960
Suddenly there is one more beside him

2534
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,160
one toe out

2535
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,960
let you go out and see his other arm

2536
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,360
Only as long as the upper arm

2537
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:49,120
This severe deformity makes this lethal bean wheat

2538
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,960
in the 1950s

2539
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,600
Discontinued in early 1960

2540
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,400
probably in our world

2541
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,200
probably have time

2542
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,400
about four or five years

2543
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,320
But it caused about 10,000 to 20,000

2544
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,120
don't know

2545
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Model

2546
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
right

2547
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
used in the bathroom

2548
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Then later in the recent

2549
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
They found that some tiredness curative effect

2550
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I can't talk about the time relationship here.

2551
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
That is to say for some

2552
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
symptoms of immunity or leprosy

2553
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
autoimmune disease

2554
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
it has some healing properties

2555
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Then I won't talk about it here

2556
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
In the end, I talked about some

2557
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
we just talked about the term new drug development

2558
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
What about new drug development?

2559
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
This is to introduce you

2560
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
We are now developing a drug

2561
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
In fact it is very strict

2562
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
then you have to because

2563
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
we say

2564
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Clinical time is considered to be human body

2565
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
That

2566
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
very strict

2567
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
So usually we need to have enough

2568
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
This so-called pre-clinical

2569
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
data means clinical trials

2570
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
these data

2571
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
you have to collect

2572
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Let's say you want to tell people this

2573
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
toxicity of this molecule

2574
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
inside

2575
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
How are you doing with everyone?

2576
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,700
To collect enough data

2577
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,100
You're going to send it to the FDA

2578
01:31:04,100 --> 01:31:06,400
The audit thinks that this data

2579
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,100
can be tested in humans

2580
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,700
He will follow you to do clinical trials

2581
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:13,200
This clinical trial actually has three phases

2582
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,900
Have Face 1 Face 2 Face 3

2583
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,800
Every stage is checked

2584
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,200
So it's actually a very rigorous process

2585
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,500
you can't say casually

2586
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:23,400
You mean I'm like that right now

2587
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,100
Feed him straight away

2588
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:26,300
it's okay to fuck dad

2589
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,500
in fact it's fine

2590
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,300
Now after these 100 years

2591
01:31:29,300 --> 01:31:31,900
I think we have a good idea for a process like this

2592
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:32,700
Right Reductive

2593
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:34,700
Generally speaking

2594
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:36,400
The so-called preclinical experimental data

2595
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,200
basically because we have to do it before the animals

2596
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,000
Not to be done before human experiments

2597
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,400
So it's an animal model

2598
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,400
So at this time you have to tell others about the experiment of reading Chinese

2599
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,900
what happens with this drug

2600
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,200
we are all metabolized

2601
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,400
pharmacokinetics

2602
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,900
How does he supplement the various temperatures in the body

2603
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,600
you have to speak clearly

2604
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,400
inside the animal

2605
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,600
can you do it with your heart

2606
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,700
explain clearly

2607
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
When it comes to clinical trials, there is a so-called internship

2608
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,500
What about medical internships?

2609
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,000
with healthy people

2610
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It is a healthy person to do the experiment

2611
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Of course this pre-punctural inoculation

2612
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
made in animals

2613
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Do it again

2614
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,500
After this is passed

2615
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:17,000
You can enter the second and third stages

2616
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
The second stage, the third stage

2617
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
what about this time

2618
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,500
is used on patients

2619
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,000
You have to look at him at this time

2620
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Is there any medical effect

2621
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
this is very important

2622
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
And you have to give the doctor in the hospital

2623
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,500
or you can't talk to him

2624
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,500
Which one is the drug and which one is the placebo

2625
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:31,500
because you might

2626
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,500
A group of patients is given vitamins

2627
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,500
but you give him medicine

2628
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:36,500
A group of his patients, that's the real drug in the experiment

2629
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:38,500
But doctors and nurses don't know

2630
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,500
so they

2631
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:42,000
It's just that they just go over the table

2632
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
To collect blood and urine from patients

2633
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Then analyze his symptoms

2634
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,500
Then if you wait until the third stage

2635
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,000
it's huge

2636
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Experiments with potentially hundreds or thousands of people

2637
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
At this time, the experiment will be compared with existing drugs

2638
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
for comparison

2639
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,500
If there is a significant effect

2640
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,000
he will let

2641
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,700
if no noticeable effect

2642
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:03,200
or worse

2643
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:05,900
Then it is very likely that your previous efforts will be in vain.

2644
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,800
then if you are lucky

2645
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,200
Can you pass these experiments?

2646
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,900
You can talk to the US Food and Drug Administration

2647
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,700
or Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration

2648
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:16,600
Sent all is a New Drug application says

2649
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,900
I did all the data

2650
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,100
I have human experiment data

2651
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,700
please take a good look

2652
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:22,100
then if you are satisfied

2653
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,700
you let me go public

2654
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,700
So it's a very rigorous process

2655
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:26,900
That

2656
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,200
So it's done like this

2657
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:30,700
Why

2658
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:32,400
We say that this internship is more and more

2659
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,000
This time is getting longer and longer

2660
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,700
That means you spend more and more money

2661
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:36,400
more and more time

2662
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,500
because of us

2663
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,000
What about the human body?

2664
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,200
it's too early

2665
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,100
So we have to test more things

2666
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,400
more and more

2667
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:46,300
So it turns into saying you need to pay more and more

2668
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,700
A billion dollars may not have been needed ten years ago

2669
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:50,300
Now it may cost 1.2 to 1.5 billion

2670
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,300
What about the average statistical average?

2671
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,300
probably needed before

2672
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,000
five to eight years

2673
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,200
Then you may have to delay it for ten to twelve years

2674
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,600
So this is getting

2675
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:00,000
more and more money

2676
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,340
An increasingly risky Biannese

2677
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,140
In addition, in fact, we are developing

2678
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,720
There are some stimulating measures

2679
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,520
like this orphan drug act

2680
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:12,800
Open drug的Ecusivity

2681
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:14,080
And Face trading

2682
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:15,100
for some

2683
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,380
rare disease

2684
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,660
how exciting

2685
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,200
The pharmaceutical company asked him to invest

2686
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:20,740
or some medicine

2687
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,300
There are currently no effective treatments

2688
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:24,580
forFace trading

2689
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,800
can get quickly

2690
01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:33,580
get certified and go public

2691
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:35,120
so these things i think

2692
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,160
Today I just use a very simple

2693
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:38,440
speech to everyone

2694
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:39,720
to illustrate

2695
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,780
Then I'll wait a minute. I don't know what's wrong with you.

2696
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,340
If you have any questions, I hope you can ask them

2697
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,620
then i will talk about it today

2698
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:56,620
Well, we thank Professor Lin for his very simple and wonderful speech

2699
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:57,900
many stories

2700
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,220
20 minutes is not enough, we are open to your questions

2701
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:03,720
Come

2702
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,280
that you know is my question

2703
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,280
we don't have much time now let's just talk

2704
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:12,780
the avestin just mentioned

2705
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:14,580
that thing

2706
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,120
My eyes were in 2005

2707
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:18,920
that

2708
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:22,220
The main mirror vein of the left eye ruptured

2709
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:24,420
that's painless

2710
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,920
More than 28 days to see a doctor

2711
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,000
So follow that eye

2712
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Entire vision is gone

2713
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
that he said this in the early days

2714
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
at that Taipei Medical College

2715
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
He said that with that similar treatment

2716
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Of course the spring of 2006

2717
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Taipei Medical University gave up

2718
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
He said there was no way to make a special trip

2719
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
He asked me about the dragon bug I told him to go to Taiwan Road

2720
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Because at that time there were only these two hospitals

2721
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
You can use that avestin when you get the government's punctuality

2722
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
He said that the medicine was supposed to cure liver cancer

2723
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
But the effect is not good

2724
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
He said to use this to suppress this

2725
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Clean Tube Treatment Works Well

2726
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
My eye became a ruptured vein

2727
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
So the human body is the source of many threats

2728
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
But when the threat tube increases

2729
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
a question that blood pressure

2730
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Soared to 63 at the highest

2731
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I feel like throwing up all day, I can't even fight

2732
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
He said in the early days before

2733
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
If it doesn't work, it has to be removed.

2734
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Then there is this medicine

2735
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
He hit this eye

2736
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
That one dose is 28,000 yuan

2737
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Not covered by health insurance

2738
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
But the potion is not so big because the eyeballs are not dry

2739
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
so measles

2740
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Four people taking that one dose at the same time

2741
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
but after injection

2742
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
after more than a year

2743
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
His vision is now restored

2744
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
It's that transformation image

2745
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
won't distort

2746
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
But that no way is no way liquid poison

2747
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
But now it reverts every three months

2748
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
that kid is normal

2749
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
He said that the medicine man will be fine

2750
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
or something later

2751
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Sorry, I

2752
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
I said one of you, you got the data in the invasion

2753
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,240
That Avasin just didn't talk

2754
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,800
Yeah, except for that swollen cow

2755
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,400
It is another word that is useful in Yan Fu

2756
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,840
Because our eyes are an interesting organ

2757
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,680
That is to say, generally speaking, if your body says that a blood vessel is broken,

2758
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,640
Then the body will have regenerative blood vessels to pre-close it

2759
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:24,140
But the eyes cannot grow blood vessels casually

2760
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:26,180
Then your problem is that blood vessels grow out

2761
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:27,940
it affects your vision

2762
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:30,940
The treatment of mentally retarded new blood vessels

2763
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,040
Avasin is a

2764
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,040
In addition there are other

2765
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,940
Like the Leise just mentioned, it is a very traditional medicinal bladder

2766
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:36,540
photodynamic therapy

2767
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,540
It is the substance that takes it with a sense of light

2768
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:40,340
Burn it in the way of ray light

2769
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,540
that's all

2770
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:44,340
So now it means that there are two stalls of the same drug

2771
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:46,140
The curative effect is pretty good

2772
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:48,440
Then you just talked about how Avasin has sequelae

2773
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,440
I don't think there will be any repercussions

2774
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:51,040
So it should be put here

2775
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:54,140
This has passed very strict human experiments.

2776
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:55,140
I don't think so

2777
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:57,640
Because usually what I just mentioned means human experiments

2778
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,600
Although there are three stages

2779
01:37:58,600 --> 01:37:59,940
In fact there is a fourth stage

2780
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,280
Even if the first time is the FDA, he collects it at any time

2781
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,280
Even after the drug is on the market

2782
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,680
He wants to collect reports on the market at any time

2783
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:10,000
If there is any adverse reaction, he will give a warning

2784
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,880
So I just drugged things like Lome Ting

2785
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,320
It's his after warning

2786
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,760
Warning to the end there is no way

2787
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,920
His drug seems to be like this, take it off the shelf

2788
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:19,440
so i don't think abastin

2789
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,560
Now their problem is the tumor

2790
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,720
Metastatic tumors do not respond significantly

2791
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:27,520
Then I don't think there is any problem with the eyes

2792
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:29,520
Thank you

2793
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,200
Thanks

2794
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,800
Are there any other questions?

2795
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,000
later

2796
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,640
Excuse me about the H1N1 we have in the coming year

2797
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,640
Did he go through this Face 1 2 3 like this

2798
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:46,480
That vaccine is our own domestic vaccine

2799
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,240
i believe there is

2800
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:53,040
So in the end, did he follow the Protocol of Face 1 Face 2 Face 3?

2801
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,960
We say his watch is over the top

2802
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,240
For example, there is a prescribed number of people

2803
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,000
i am not defense

2804
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
man at defense vaccine factory

2805
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
i can't tell you

2806
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
And if you know today our dean or anyone else

2807
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
but i'm not in there

2808
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I'm not fit for any criticism

2809
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Because any criticism I make is unfair to them

2810
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,000
so i have no choice

2811
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
I have no data to tell you

2812
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
OK

2813
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Erase you just mentioned

2814
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Geneva Jaffet

2815
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
It seems to be off the market in the United States

2816
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
That's a relatively new drug now

2817
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
The second generation is Tasiva

2818
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It is a branch of EGF

2819
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
You say Erase

2820
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Erase seems to be useful for Asians

2821
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
That's from EGF

2822
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Yes, that's EGF

2823
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
it seems so

2824
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
no need to eat

2825
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
But he is relatively useless to Europeans and Americans

2826
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Erase is for Long Cancer

2827
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
They found that he was committed to a less high percentage in Europe and America

2828
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
but in asia

2829
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
is very useful

2830
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Sixty to seventy percent of people are polluted

2831
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
that's just because

2832
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
the reaction to the medicine

2833
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,280
but did not say

2834
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,640
That is to say, he generally

2835
01:40:04,640 --> 01:40:06,800
Because his success rate of self-reliance rate is not so high

2836
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,360
He may have other alternative medications that can be substituted

2837
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,200
You also mentioned that coach

2838
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,720
Avestan的Avestan

2839
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,000
As far as I know it is for that Metastatic

2840
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,600
Breast Cancer is useless

2841
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:20,480
you are right

2842
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:21,840
but not for all

2843
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,600
All of these transfers are useless

2844
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,600
Just for Breast Cancer

2845
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:27,600
Okay, thank you

2846
01:40:28,240 --> 01:40:30,240
that has one

2847
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,240
these nutrients

2848
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:36,240
Nutrients

2849
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,240
For example like Glucosamine

2850
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:40,240
In fact, many of us

2851
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,240
A while ago with Sydney Heck

2852
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,120
we are chatting

2853
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:45,120
He is an American expert

2854
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,120
He said they were liars

2855
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:49,120
no use at all

2856
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,120
Because of that Glucosamine

2857
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,120
we should do it

2858
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,240
Sati Glucosamine

2859
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:56,240
So the dean has been talking to me for a long time

2860
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:58,240
open a company

2861
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,240
to turn Glucosamine into

2862
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
He said that's easy, get it done

2863
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
i squeezed you

2864
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
let's start a company

2865
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
that's what works

2866
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Because of that Glucosamine

2867
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
That solubility is not right

2868
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
After that

2869
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Wisdom

2870
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
But say so

2871
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I'm not fair either

2872
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
My wife wants me to eat a few pills every day

2873
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
so

2874
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I still listen to my wife

2875
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
but this

2876
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
have some nutritious food

2877
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
actually

2878
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Not necessarily the one they were talking about

2879
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
yes and

2880
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
very cheap because

2881
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Glucosamine

2882
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
how he

2883
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Glucosamine

2884
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
he is from that

2885
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Shrimp shells, crab shells

2886
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,000
people are different

2887
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
then decompose it

2888
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
So it's actually cheap

2889
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
very cheap stuff

2890
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
but you can see

2891
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
a can

2892
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
probably both

2893
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
good

2894
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
yes

2895
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
thousands of dollars is expensive

2896
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,000
but

2897
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
unjustified violence

2898
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Fairness should take care of it

2899
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
i have two questions

2900
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Just now you said Glucosamine

2901
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
OK then if

2902
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
like us

2903
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
You added because you said it was just cartilage

2904
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
Cartilage is your single component

2905
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Is it useful to add a single thing?

2906
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
The second question is, just now you said

2907
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
in human business

2908
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
It is drug discovery

2909
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
You want a lot of SOP

2910
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Cleaner trade phase one phase two phase three

2911
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
if a drug

2912
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
it has passed in the usa

2913
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
它的 phase one phase two phase three

2914
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Do we have to do the same procedure in Taiwan?

2915
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Because of different races?

2916
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I answer your second question

2917
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Usually it means this clinical trial

2918
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
tantamount to saying

2919
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
So this is a couple of issues

2920
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
very good question

2921
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
That is to say today a clinical trial

2922
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
it must be in

2923
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
because if you take into account the issue of race

2924
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Different races react differently to drugs

2925
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So it must be in a different area of ​​the drug

2926
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
able to do some clinical trials

2927
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
It collects enough data

2928
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
it can know to say

2929
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
There are different reactions in different regions

2930
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
The second is to say

2931
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
The understanding of the second consideration is that

2932
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
In fact these protocols

2933
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
like you said

2934
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
in fact there is

2935
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
it has certain rules

2936
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
that now

2937
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
There are many medicines in Taiwan now

2938
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Come to Taiwan to do CleanLTry

2939
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,500
In fact, we are follow US FDA

2940
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:06,000
the prologue

2941
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,600
we think his procigil

2942
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,000
to his program to do

2943
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
So in the future these things

2944
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,500
It is the US FDA, which will naturally pass

2945
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,500
If we say that some countries today

2946
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,500
like japan or other countries

2947
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:20,000
Their standards are different from FDA

2948
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Then he passed the experiment in Japan

2949
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
He's going to America to do it all over again

2950
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,500
Because he adopts different standards

2951
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:30,500
So it turns into whether you want to be in line with international standards

2952
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:31,500
just like sync

2953
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,500
That's relatively easy

2954
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:37,500
Then we follow FDA standards to do

2955
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,500
OK

2956
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:40,500
Then your first question was

2957
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,500
Say you Google

2958
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,500
Yeah

2959
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:46,500
can't that be

2960
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:47,500
No

2961
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,500
Because of the Google gas you just mentioned

2962
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:51,500
The other one is Google gas

2963
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,500
of our body

2964
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,500
or Google gas

2965
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,500
on google

2966
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:59,500
He can sell people very expensive

2967
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,200
is worth not staying pathological

2968
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:03,600
So can't hope for a long time that I can start a company

2969
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,600
I also hope that

2970
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,460
Ask Professor Lin

2971
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,500
the one you just mentioned

2972
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:13,500
Astilin is extracted from that Liushi

2973
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:14,000
right

2974
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
and that

2975
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,160
That Purple Mountain Lip of the Pacific Purple Mountain

2976
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,060
then ask you

2977
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:20,000
that this

2978
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,460
Medicines like this belong to natural medicine

2979
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:26,560
still belongs to western medicine

2980
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,200
Another problem is

2981
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:31,960
About your anti-cancer and another kind of that

2982
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:35,960
Anti-cancer drugs are extracted from customs

2983
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,260
Then do you think this anti-cancer drug is effective?

2984
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:39,560
what you just said

2985
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:43,960
The effects of Asti and Aretha

2986
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:46,660
which one is better

2987
01:44:46,660 --> 01:44:47,160
Thanks

2988
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,060
The second question is because of that

2989
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,200
Because many medicines have different injection chambers

2990
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,960
have a name or we don't

2991
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,160
i don't know what it is

2992
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,860
so i can't answer you

2993
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:57,760
I have no way to answer the second question just mentioned

2994
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,760
the first one

2995
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:00,020
you speak so-so

2996
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,800
We just talked about paper mountain lip or aspirin

2997
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,000
It is from the natural temperature

2998
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
But you can't say I'm today because it works

2999
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:08,500
as people said before

3000
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,000
Anti-cow feeling should be made from star anise

3001
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
just ran to buy star anise

3002
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
logic doesn't work like this

3003
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Why?

3004
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
because you go straight to

3005
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I induce you to give birth

3006
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:18,000
you eat directly

3007
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Assuming there are vegetarian skins to eat

3008
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
The problem is that it has different ingredients in it

3009
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
you eat

3010
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
you eat these ingredients

3011
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
In addition, we usually

3012
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
These studies usually brittle these things out

3013
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
and you know the amount

3014
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
If you directly from the natural temperature tax

3015
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
when your medicine

3016
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
that dose is very low

3017
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Then you have different other ingredients

3018
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
this is very complicated

3019
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
So this is where Chinese medicine differs from Western medicine.

3020
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
words of Chinese medicine

3021
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
it is to emphasize this

3022
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,000
The effect of combining different ingredients

3023
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
That's Western medicine, it's

3024
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
it's clear

3025
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
because you look at the single ingredient

3026
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
but it tells you

3027
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I want to experiment with cells

3028
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
experiments with animals

3029
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
experiments with humans

3030
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
These currencies also have my ability

3031
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,640
can make you eat

3032
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:04,840
This logic is different from philosophy

3033
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,000
but i mean

3034
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,400
He is extracted like this

3035
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:15,200
It also belongs to the natural medicine medicine

3036
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:16,400
or western medicine

3037
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,000
Western medicine

3038
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:17,480
Western medicine

3039
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,280
Okay, thank you

3040
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:22,200
Yes, he is already a single compound

3041
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:24,400
do it with a single compound

3042
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,960
This continues some of the clinical careers above

3043
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:29,000
So he is already a thing of western medicine

3044
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:29,400
Western medicine

3045
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:29,800
right

3046
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:33,000
And the molecule will be modified again like just now

3047
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:33,400
right

3048
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,000
Like that Hoffmann just now for his neighborhood

3049
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,400
he did some chemistry with him

3050
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,800
he still modified

3051
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:39,600
what do you think

3052
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,000
you, let me add

3053
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,600
The wash you just asked about

3054
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,400
That's Tob Teigen

3055
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,000
Temple Teigen kind of thing

3056
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,800
Then his mechanism of action is different from that of Zishanchun.

3057
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:54,600
Texel acts on the microtubules he just mentioned

3058
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:55,800
The one from Jubilant

3059
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,200
that synthetic

3060
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,800
that wash this

3061
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,760
is an efficiency that acts on the action of DNA

3062
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,200
These two are not the same

3063
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:06,500
He is in our Converse land

3064
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,960
In Taiwan, it is currently the health insurance index

3065
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:10,360
used for a while

3066
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,160
no

3067
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:12,760
no

3068
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:14,200
it's the large intestine

3069
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:15,700
Fatty bowel cancer

3070
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:16,300
Feel sorry

3071
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:18,500
It is used in colorectal adipose bowel cancer

3072
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,860
health care index

3073
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:21,760
Thanks

3074
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,000
Professor Lin, ask me

3075
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,160
two questions

3076
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:28,860
first question

3077
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:31,420
Can Painkillers Harm Your Liver?

3078
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:32,100
second question

3079
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,860
My mother has been suffering from severe gout recently

3080
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:36,760
I took her to see a doctor at Chenda Hospital

3081
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,540
As a result, the doctor

3082
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:40,500
just opened that rib lip

3083
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:42,460
I freaked out when I saw the rib lip

3084
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:44,000
And open four

3085
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,640
So eat four at a time

3086
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,800
Each tablet is about 5mg

3087
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,800
then i want to ask

3088
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,360
We are generally not on the rib lip

3089
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,700
have a bad impression

3090
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:53,740
Said to eat too much

3091
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:54,800
not good for health

3092
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,900
can you explain

3093
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:58,000
I'm still emphasizing

3094
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
not a doctor

3095
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Not a doctor at National Taiwan University Hospital

3096
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,700
I'm just a little researcher

3097
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:04,200
so i didn't really didn't

3098
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,920
and i didn't see your mother

3099
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:07,000
What kind of symptoms does she have?

3100
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I really can't make this diagnosis

3101
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,660
It's really something that has no limited manpower.

3102
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:13,160
there is no way

3103
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:16,000
I'm just asking about steroids

3104
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,560
tell you

3105
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,860
The problem is Steroid it has a different effect

3106
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:23,160
And it often makes some

3107
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,960
adjustment

3108
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,460
So you usually have to be very careful when using

3109
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,920
then i guess maybe

3110
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,620
I don't know if it's because of your mother

3111
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:33,660
have specific symptoms

3112
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:34,860
so the doctor has

3113
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:37,160
There will also be such a class assessment achievement

3114
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,960
I think you should be direct

3115
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,860
do one with the doctor

3116
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:42,560
to communicate face to face

3117
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,360
this is better

3118
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:46,120
I can't give you a split opinion

3119
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:48,460
what was your first question

3120
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:50,560
Can Painkillers Hurt Your Liver?

3121
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,260
That painkiller hurts the liver

3122
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:54,960
This is on the side of the Puna phlegm

3123
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,460
There is an explanation

3124
01:48:56,460 --> 01:48:58,360
If you have read relevant information

3125
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,460
But usually

3126
01:48:59,460 --> 01:48:59,960
Propula

3127
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
His scar basically has two prerequisites

3128
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
the first one you want to overdose

3129
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Because generally speaking, the dosage of Pranaden

3130
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,000
If as far as I know it is 500mg

3131
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
then you

3132
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Usually the dosage can reach 67 times

3133
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
He's just starting to have scars

3134
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
So two prerequisites

3135
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
one is that you want to overdose

3136
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Basically if you follow your prescription for a day

3137
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
you can never overdose

3138
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
The second is that you have to cooperate with alcohol

3139
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
it means you drink

3140
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,000
And then eat Proden

3141
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,000
that will scar

3142
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
But generally speaking, the effect of Proton

3143
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Usually low value

3144
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
unless you have these two conditions

3145
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
He gets scars when he cooperates

3146
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
i want to return to

3147
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
The period film of our nutrition

3148
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
That is to say, health medicine does not

3149
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Then my question is

3150
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
such as sleeping pills

3151
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
or political economy

3152
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
generally

3153
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
when the doctor prescribed

3154
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
patients usually

3155
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,840
I still wish I could not eat it.

3156
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,460
for fear of being dependent

3157
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:10,200
Then they'd like to be able to use another way

3158
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,200
Also all I know is

3159
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,840
A recent friend, Mr. He

3160
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:18,840
Because I moved for a long time after taking the medicine

3161
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,840
Finally sent to the emergency room

3162
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:25,340
But the one in therapy

3163
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:30,340
The doctor in the emergency room gave him another shot

3164
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:32,340
He turned into a vegetable

3165
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:37,340
So now I take the medicine

3166
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:42,340
Generally, I still hope that I can not take medicine without taking medicine.

3167
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:47,340
I have the same opinion

3168
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:48,340
because I want

3169
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:51,340
Sometimes the Central Plains Institute is under great pressure

3170
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:54,340
Can't sleep or keep sleeping

3171
01:50:54,340 --> 01:50:56,340
you are stressed

3172
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,760
So my own feeling is that later I relied on exercise

3173
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:05,000
because it means you can't sleep

3174
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,560
Maybe you have too much energy

3175
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,560
Later, I developed the habit of exercising myself

3176
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:12,400
10:00 p.m. Natural men want to sleep

3177
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,760
that's the best way

3178
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:16,760
So my own experience is that

3179
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:18,760
of course i will agree with you

3180
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,760
Unless if you really need to use

3181
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,760
I would suggest you to see a doctor for an IQ test

3182
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:24,760
Now Taiwan's problem is

3183
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,260
Because health care products you know you need to know

3184
01:51:26,260 --> 01:51:27,260
you go to the doctor

3185
01:51:27,260 --> 01:51:28,760
Of course the hospital will give you 3 minutes and 5 minutes

3186
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:29,760
about to be kicked out

3187
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,760
So if you have an IQ

3188
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,760
subject doctor

3189
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:34,760
talk to him well

3190
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:36,760
Because usually doctors start firing

3191
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,760
basically knowing your medical history

3192
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:41,760
Or do you have any of these techniques for taking medicine

3193
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,760
or even have an allergy

3194
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:45,760
Like academician Zhong, a member of our hospital

3195
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,760
His allergy to that allergy drug

3196
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:49,760
and good research

3197
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,760
You need to understand these things

3198
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:52,760
Only then can the medicine that really suits you be dismissed

3199
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:53,760
right now we just talked about

3200
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,760
personalized therapy

3201
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,760
personalized medicine

3202
01:51:57,760 --> 01:51:58,760
is the most important

3203
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,560
The health insurance system, I suggest

3204
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,880
You should find a family doctor you can trust

3205
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:08,440
He can do some better counseling

3206
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:10,920
In this case, you will not use enough drugs

3207
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:13,320
i don't think it will go wrong

3208
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,960
Then he has someone, you are after

3209
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,520
you fade

3210
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:25,080
i have an idea that you are

3211
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:27,900
What is the so-called voter medicine?

3212
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:31,740
It means that his patent has passed zero, so it can be opened

3213
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:34,300
Drugs that everyone can produce

3214
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:40,440
Not wrong, because of the so-called professional, because he spent a lot of time opening the pharmaceutical factory

3215
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:43,780
So usually the patent protection period is about 12 to 15 years.

3216
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:45,300
you start

3217
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:49,140
After registering this patent, you can get a reward and then sell it

3218
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:51,200
So sometimes after too long a delay, he really

3219
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:54,260
Can sell the whole world alone only you can sell

3220
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:55,540
that may not be a few years

3221
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:57,340
so he gave you a while

3222
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:58,940
But a patent is about to fall

3223
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:00,100
This patent has passed

3224
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,080
All pharmaceutical factories are put into production

3225
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,160
So generally speaking, it should be cheaper to learn folk medicine

3226
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,200
Because everyone can produce

3227
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:11,520
It should be relatively simple to compete in the next grid

3228
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:14,340
So Suscanol is

3229
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:16,380
Is it the unobtainable scholar medicine?

3230
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:18,440
I know it's Panodol

3231
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,460
I don't know if there are other

3232
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,740
Shoppers

3233
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,280
Astamino Fan

3234
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,120
this medicine you

3235
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,900
I have a cold recently

3236
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:28,920
so i go buy this

3237
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:31,240
The blessing hat is to make up for it

3238
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,300
You open that medicine list and look at it

3239
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,080
at least twenty names

3240
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:36,600
so

3241
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:39,160
Just say a name, it doesn't have to be

3242
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:41,220
That's because the blessing hat has

3243
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,740
neutralize symptoms

3244
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,280
so it curbs your runny nose

3245
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:45,040
Stop knocking

3246
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,360
It's got a bunch so it's got a lot of medicine in it

3247
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,140
the same medicine

3248
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:50,940
that

3249
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:52,720
that drug

3250
01:53:52,980 --> 01:53:53,760
its name

3251
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:57,080
There are twenty-three kinds of names because different names came out.

3252
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,080
So everyone is probably saying the same thing

3253
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
have a different name

3254
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:05,280
OK, is there anything else?

3255
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,780
the student

3256
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:08,780
here then please

3257
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:15,680
hello i ask two

3258
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:18,080
I ask two questions

3259
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:19,880
maybe my question is a bit stupid

3260
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:21,220
that is

3261
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:22,760
Why are there so many drugs

3262
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:26,220
It is metabolized to go out in the end

3263
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:28,460
Then when it biochemically reacts

3264
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:32,180
No, structural changes cannot happen immediately

3265
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:33,460
first question

3266
01:54:33,460 --> 01:54:34,460
then the second question

3267
01:54:34,460 --> 01:54:37,380
can i go over that spring part again

3268
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,300
that is

3269
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:41,500
Because I have researched that Reynolds backsong

3270
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,260
then i should say

3271
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:44,260
that

3272
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:47,040
Because I went to study that

3273
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,540
the capital compound

3274
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:50,040
solid compound

3275
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:51,340
because it has slow

3276
01:54:51,340 --> 01:54:52,840
then i want to ask

3277
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,480
Can you say Spring again

3278
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,680
how to prove

3279
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,380
It is a non-ethnic compound

3280
01:54:58,380 --> 01:54:59,780
But it can also achieve

3281
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Anti-addiction effect

3282
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,000
first question

3283
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
drug metabolism

3284
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
usual practice

3285
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
he didn't

3286
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
take a medicine

3287
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Then from the original molecule

3288
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
run out like this

3289
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
absolutely impossible

3290
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
usually especially some

3291
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
water-based drugs

3292
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Usually above he will do some oxidation

3293
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
usually

3294
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
The approach is that he wants to be on top of this drug

3295
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
do the same similar

3296
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
he is going to track

3297
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
e.g. in blood

3298
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
he wants to clarify

3299
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Then purify

3300
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
to identify what he has become

3301
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
what kind of biochemical reaction

3302
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
that is in

3303
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Pri-Kin-Yo-Three

3304
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
In fact he was

3305
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
money

3306
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
FaceOne, he is going to do these studies now

3307
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,000
this must be done

3308
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
so impossible

3309
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
most will not

3310
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Running out like this

3311
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
absolutely not

3312
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
the second

3313
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
you talk about lace dragon

3314
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
because you signed a lot

3315
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Chinese translated name

3316
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
we have no way

3317
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
so we can

3318
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Let's talk about this in private, okay?

3319
