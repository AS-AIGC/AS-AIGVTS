00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Thank you for your participation

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The hot weather of the summer vacation

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Then everyone made a special trip to come over and was very touched

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that mainly i think

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Of course, you may be interested in this topic

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is we put

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It is the Laceup key

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Laceup button

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Laceup button

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Anyway

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
well that's mainly this

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How can we in Taipei follow

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Pompeii linked together

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, in fact, especially in recent years

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We do a lot of work on the mainland site

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Of course, this world happens to have

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Pompeii film in 2014 also

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
also played

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So the whole world is especially Taiwanese

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Notice

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In fact, there are actually many topics for such a topic.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My colleagues or some friends say that my topic is too sensational

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So you give this title

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Just to trick everyone

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Actually this topic is not

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I shouldn't have given it to you

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Conversely, because I did work on the Continental War

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So I go to many places, no matter assisting speeches or popular science speeches

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In fact, after most of the speeches, people will come to me and ask me

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Will Taipei become Pompeii?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So this is something that a lot of people care about

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
then i hope today this

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
more than an hour of these materials

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
After sharing with you, I think everyone will have the answer

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This very clear answer must be presented

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
especially in recent months

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Last one or two years

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
we'll start with this

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
At the end of last year, the Legislative Yuan

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
volcanic disaster

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,040
Natural disasters like earthquakes, typhoons, floods, etc.

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,000
add volcanic disaster

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,640
But everyone knows this is a new thing

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,040
the past was never

45
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,280
That's because the Legislative Yuan passed this amendment

46
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,480
Therefore, the Executive Yuan and local governments have taken many related actions.

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,280
that's especially taipei

48
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:28,160
The volcanic disaster that Taipei also practiced at the end of March this year

49
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,720
Especially for the residents of Beitou and Tianmu under Yangming Mountain

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,560
let them know in case of volcanic activity

51
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,080
how to deal with

52
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,760
Because in the history of mankind we Taiwan

53
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,480
but no volcanic disaster

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,120
The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia around us

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,920
In fact, there are volcanic disasters at both ends of the three days

56
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,880
Both their people and the government have some ideas about how to deal with it

57
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,000
But Taiwan is really strange

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,960
So hopefully we know more about the hazards of this volcano

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,420
especially in recent months

60
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,420
Volcanoes this May in Hawaii

61
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,920
The dragon smoke flow is on the road

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Everyone knows that Dragon Mist

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
It's very hot and very scary

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Anything that touches it will be completely destroyed.

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,920
Then if you go to Google and read a lot of reports like this

66
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,920
Whether it's a direct dragon smoke stream

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Or some breathing or toxic gas

68
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
There are actually many kinds

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
In fact, here I would like to point out the following

70
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
This time, the eruption of this volcano

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Caused a 6.9 earthquake

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,920
That's actually science

73
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Or quite a lot of people are quite curious

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Do volcanoes cause earthquakes?

75
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Not only this time in Hawaii

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,920
The volcanic eruption in 1975

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Also triggered a larger 7.1 earthquake

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So what's the point of this?

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In fact, if you are interested in earth science or Taiwan

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If there are some concepts of these geology in northern Taiwan

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In fact, you will think of what is next to the volcano on the mainland

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We actually have quite a few foothill faults that seismologists worry about

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Then someone talked about volcanic activity

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Could it be something like the event that triggered the Foothill Fault?

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The foothills fault in the evaluation of experts and scholars

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If this dislocation of the entire fault at the foot of the mountain

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The earthquake that is likely to be triggered is about 6.5 to 6.6

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Although not very big compared with this

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But it's on the fringe of metropolis Taipei

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
In fact, according to the evaluation of the International Earthquake Company Center

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If the fault at the foot of the mountain is active

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thousands of houses in Taipei may collapse

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Of course thousands of lives were lost

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
it's potentially dangerous

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Of course, this is the relationship between outer volcanoes and earthquakes

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
volcanoes cause earthquakes

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Earthquakes trigger volcanoes

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
But it doesn't have to be a matter of incentives

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,100
in some cases there will be

100
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,800
The summer fish activity in May

101
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
volcanic activity

102
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,100
On June 2nd, Gualimara in Central and South America

103
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,300
This is also the scene of the volcano

104
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,700
There can be these lava flows, debris flows, mudflows

105
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,300
Then look at the volcanic eruption of summer fish

106
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,400
from the past few decades

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,400
hardly a single life was lost

108
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,300
But compared to Central and South America

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,400
Look at this a volcanic eruption

110
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
dozens of people died

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
hundreds of people missing

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,700
Most of that believed to be missing

113
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,200
Roughly equal to the number of deaths

114
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,300
then you can see

115
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,900
This Central and South American and summer fish

116
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,500
why such a big difference

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,400
In addition to the difference in volcanic characteristics

118
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,800
actually very important very important what is

119
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,700
This summer fish has done a lot of work

120
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,400
Japan has done a lot

121
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,000
Volcanoes like Japan are often erupting

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,900
But the threat to human life

123
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,100
really very few

124
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,700
That

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,400
Like this June, Sakurajima Volcano is erupting

126
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,700
Of course, this dragon is flowing, because Sakurajima is across the sea

127
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,800
So there is actually no direct dragon smoke flow, broken hole flow, or threat to this city.

128
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
But volcanic ash is actually causing a lot of trouble, too.

129
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,200
Then this Bali Island, Bali Island in Indonesia

130
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,200
This is also the last volcanic activity at the end of June

131
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Then some of the things that caused the tourist crowds

132
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Well, I'm actually going to tell a little story about this.

133
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,700
It's the end of June this year

134
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,700
In fact, Agong Volcano was in October last year

135
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,200
If everyone has an impression, he also sprayed it once

136
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Then this was two months before the eruption of Agong Volcano

137
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
One day I arrived at the office at 8 o'clock in the morning

138
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I got a call from this certain reporter, a reporter from the radio station.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
He called and said, Teacher Lin, hello, I'm Momo reporter

140
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,920
Who, who, actually, I can't remember

141
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,440
Well, it's really because of too many reporters.

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,360
Then I said yes yes I remembered

143
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,840
He said let me ask you a question

144
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,760
I said I thought there was another news

145
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,880
He said no no it was a personal accident

146
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
The reason is that he is going to Paris Island

147
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,400
He's celebrating his 25th birthday

148
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,520
Because those friends are going to Paris Island to play

149
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,680
As a result, when he was going

150
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,640
Paris Island announced that the volcano had started quasi-motion

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Then he called me and asked me if I wanted to go

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,360
then i will talk to him

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
This Indonesian survey

154
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,120
Because I don't have the data

155
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't understand very clearly

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,480
but i told him

157
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,640
if you are not in such a hurry

158
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,360
you may wait a little while

159
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,640
After Indonesia or the official announcement

160
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,680
then you have to judge

161
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,760
Then he probably listened to me

162
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,440
just two months

163
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
another morning

164
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,520
he called again

165
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm Mongolian reporter

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,040
He said sorry for me now

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now at Zhongzheng Airport

168
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
the night before

169
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
waited for two months

170
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,960
Volcano finally erupts to the surface

171
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,020
He said, should I go?

172
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,100
really two months

173
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,300
I said you are amazing

174
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,320
The flight was delayed just in time for the volcanic eruption

175
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Then I told him that you might go

176
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,300
Maybe there will be a delay at the airport like this

177
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
But because

178
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
The one that erupted from Grandpa Volcano

179
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,200
This Paris Island tourist place is about 60 kilometers away

180
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,500
Maybe the volcano will have some impact on the airport

181
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,300
But at least the safety of your life should be nothing

182
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,400
scruples

183
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,700
so he went

184
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,200
so what does this represent

185
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,700
In fact, the volcano does not come instantly

186
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,900
unlike an earthquake

187
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,200
We can't predict earthquakes yet.

188
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,300
when will you come

189
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,300
no one can tell

190
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,000
But volcanoes basically

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
like just said

192
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,100
this japan america

193
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
or these

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
They can actually warn you by doing some observation techniques

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He started moving purely

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You may have to prepare or do something

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So overall

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In fact, the simplest way is to say

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You may well imagine that

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
this is our taipei

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
this is 101

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is me climbing to the top of the Nine-Five Peak

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
took a photo

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then I put this

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The ancient city of Pompeii covered the Seven Star Mountain

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
will it be like this

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's something that many people imagine

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
then we want to talk today

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Pompeii and Taipei

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
or this

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Great Looming Volcano

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Vesvi

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
do some comparisons

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
what does he have the same

215
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
how is he different

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
then we know

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
what will happen to him

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So according to this very simple introduction

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I probably have six of these

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let me tell you about this

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The first, of course, is nothing more than

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,400
Let me introduce the relationship between Pompeii and Vesvi

223
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,600
We all know each other well

224
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
Maybe some people are a little blurry

225
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Let us now briefly introduce the space-time background

226
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
let everyone know a little bit

227
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,100
And the main part is to say

228
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,200
when the volcano erupts

229
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Why did it cause the entire city of Pompeii

230
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,000
the whole is submerged

231
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,300
what kind of disaster it has

232
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,900
By the way we introduce it

233
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,300
Then the second is

234
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,000
Taipei and Datong volcanoes

235
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Just now the vice president also said

236
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,700
it's a volcano

237
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,400
In fact, this is what we have done in the past ten years

238
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,800
Some of our like-minded friends in the academic world

239
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,700
Results from different observations

240
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,400
it looks like a volcano

241
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,600
That's especially my own work on this magma chamber

242
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,400
It actually took me a lot of time

243
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,300
Sometimes I'm embarrassed to speak in private

244
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,200
In ancient times, I heard people say

245
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Grind one piece in this decade

246
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
I have that deep feeling

247
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,300
I spent more than ten years

248
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,000
finally put

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Want to Answer Questions Do Some Find Some Answers

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The fourth part is TVO

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
This aunt volcano is alive with this aunt volcano

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and threatening

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But it's not such a scary thing

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
as long as we are ready

255
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That preparation is actually based on scientific monitoring

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
scientific knowledge

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
In fact, it can provide us with many ways to deal with

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that fifth part is fun

259
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is not for fun

260
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
for me personally

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I studied ninth science

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it specializes in the study of earthquakes.

263
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When I saw the place name of this volcano

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Heartbeat with the Volcano

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm really an official

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That heartbeat like a volcano

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I believe no one in the world has seen

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
when i first saw

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't think there is such a thing

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I will report to you later

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Finally, a summary and discussion

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So I'm just posting this

273
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Explain to everyone one by one

274
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's talk about Pompeii first

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Vivo Hill

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
the italian peninsula

277
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,440
Rome

278
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,840
Then to the south of it is

279
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,440
next to the ancient city

280
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,400
Next to the ancient city is the volcano Vesuvius

281
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,840
that feeling is

282
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,600
the roman empire was very

283
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,680
when very strong

284
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,840
The economy is very good in all aspects

285
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,940
actually

286
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,840
many have

287
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,280
accomplished or

288
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,080
VIP is simple VIP

289
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,840
It will be next to the ancient city here

290
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,200
to buy a villa

291
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,800
just come here for vacation

292
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,140
why come here for vacation

293
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,540
In fact, the world probably

294
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,980
There are such phenomena

295
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,480
Near the volcano are the most

296
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,740
most beautiful

297
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,480
like tokyo in japan

298
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,440
everybody knows

299
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Next to Mount Fuji

300
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,840
about 60 kilometers

301
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,480
that's japanese

302
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,680
spirit or fly to a place where it is not possible

303
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,580
that's actually like

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then he came back to Taipei

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Taipei

306
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,000
where will this rich man be

307
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,000
You have to support yourself to build some mansions, right?

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because there are mountains and water

309
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
just beautiful

310
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
so like

311
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
As long as there are volcanoes in the world

312
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
basically just pretty

313
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that is

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's a place that makes you feel comfortable

315
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
but

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Of course he has his threats

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
2000 years ago

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The science of course is almost zero

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
so they also

320
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
didn't expect these things

321
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so right here

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
built this ancient city

323
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If you have the opportunity to go now

324
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
or have the opportunity to

325
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This is Vizvi

326
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is the current appearance of the ancient city

327
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
After everyone is excavated

328
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The rest becomes a

329
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Very

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
very this

331
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
one for many people to visit

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
a museum

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
or attractions

334
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Then of course the result of this is

335
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When Vizvi volcano erupted

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
take this

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is from the movie

338
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
the plot is

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,560
The entire ancient city of Pangbei will be covered.

340
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,660
Then review these relevant knowledge

341
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,920
this

342
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,000
Visvi and Pombe

343
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,820
In fact, Weisvi is in the ancient city of Pompei to the south of him

344
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,880
About 10 kilometers away

345
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,940
The gray one means that

346
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,720
volcanic ash

347
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,060
When the volcano erupted, the volcanic ash covered the entire area.

348
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,080
so in

349
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,960
During the eruption in 2000, the entire ancient city of Pompei was covered with 6 meters of volcanic ash

350
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,540
In fact, nothing is gone

351
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,800
That

352
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,380
The survey at the time said that there were probably

353
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,680
20,000 people live in Pombe

354
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,240
And what is the emphasis on

355
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,040
in the holiday villa

356
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,080
Everyone is relaxing over there

357
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,880
on vacation

358
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,480
It was not until the 16th century when the canal was opened

359
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,280
Found an ancient wall but

360
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,560
to this

361
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,160
In the 18th century, the king wanted to have these ancient arts

362
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,880
young cause

363
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,340
So he spent a lot of money to put this street in Pompey

364
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,700
A lot of antiquities, just dig it out

365
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,500
That's why people know

366
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,500
Oh, this used to be a very big city

367
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Although only twenty thousand

368
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
But you can imagine 20,000 people two thousand years ago

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
It's a very lively city

370
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Then they dug this

371
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,000
You see, the streets are very well planned

372
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
worthy of work

373
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and especially this

374
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This one has a giant merchant's house above it

375
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,500
It will say on the ground, this money

376
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,000
This welcome money welcomes you

377
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It means they are extravagant

378
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
In fact, go to Google to find this literature theory

379
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There are many criticisms

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It was the luxury of the life of the Romans at that time

381
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Or a lot of negative words are in it

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Then of course the last

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They don't know the money is waiting for you

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But the volcano is there too

385
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
In fact, two sides of the same body

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then why did this happen in the end?

387
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This is what we want to convey to you

388
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What kind of threat does the volcano pose to me?

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Then this is the original

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
These residents were instantly overwhelmed by high temperature

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
When pyroclastic volcanoes are buried

392
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In fact, your bone and flesh tissue is gone in an instant.

393
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But your body becomes hollow

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This is because they poured plaster into it

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
look like people at that time

396
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
helped it out

397
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
why is that so

398
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
In fact, I want to introduce to you

399
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
this pyroclastic

400
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
this is real

401
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because Pompeii in the 2000s

402
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There is no way to testify

403
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But volcanic activity

404
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
In fact, there will always be

405
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
crumbs

406
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,160
What does this photo look like?

407
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,500
Super like this sand leopard

408
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,960
Anyway, it's just a cloud of ashes.

409
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,840
so you can't see what you're wearing

410
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,600
But this is totally different from the Dust Leopard

411
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,740
Dust Leopard, look at this speed is very fast

412
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,160
100 kilometers per hour 200 kilometers per hour

413
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,800
Then this is very hot

414
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,040
hundreds of degrees of high temperature

415
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,240
It means you can't escape

416
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,000
if you are touched by it

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,500
In fact, probably like the inhabitants of Pompeii

418
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,940
almost identical

419
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,000
so you see this

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,800
These are some village houses on the hillside

421
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,940
Actually you can imagine this

422
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,500
In fact, there will be nothing left

423
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,000
would have exactly the same result as Pompeii.

424
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,140
then this is all real

425
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,840
This is a Filipino brand

426
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,100
when my volcano erupts

427
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,640
you can see

428
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,760
There's one in the lower left corner, a little bit of a truck

429
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,220
see this stream

430
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
certainly

431
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,360
Run if you can run, jump into a car if you can

432
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,340
run fast

433
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,900
But like I just said, can these people escape?

434
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,720
Basically, you can't run away, because the speed of this broken hole is faster than the car on Gao Ai Nurse Highway

435
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
What's more, this is a path in the field

436
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
That

437
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,000
Also in the same year, this silvery volcano in Japan

438
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,360
You can google this, you can see this video

439
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,880
He is here, the car is here, and when he sees the broken hole, run quickly

440
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,920
Then the broken hole flow keeps coming and going, and then

441
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,480
The screen goes black, and then why do I see

442
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,900
Later, people took this camera and put it

443
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,080
Take it out, since that record is still there

444
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,260
he played it back

445
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,600
Then restore it to the process at that time

446
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,040
So the cavitation flow is actually for volcanic disasters, it is

447
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
first place

448
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's hard to guard against, and you probably won't be able to run away when you see it

449
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
it's very very scary

450
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Then why are there crumbs? There is a very simple cartoon explanation diagram for this

451
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because when the magma keeps coming up from the crater

452
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's a thousand-degree high-temperature thing

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
After coming straight up, it's starting to cool down a bit after this side

454
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But still a few hundred degrees left

455
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
but it starts off kind of turning into something solid

456
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It just turns into stone energy, and it will feel a little cooling down slowly

457
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But when it keeps piling up

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Because of gravity, it will eventually collapse

459
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
so when it accumulates a lot

460
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
When it collapsed in an instant, a debris flow was generated

461
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Underneath are small stones or these large and small stones

462
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There's volcanic ash on it, and it's all down

463
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So this is the one that threatens the most

464
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And what I just said is because of the high temperature

465
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Look at this, as soon as you get down, the whole house burns down

466
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
which one is the most

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,340
The most modern, and the best example of this, is the Ginsen Volcano in Japan

468
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,300
This is the eruption of this Yinxian volcano

469
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,840
Then this is Shimabara Temple, just at the foot of the mountain

470
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,700
And then this tax leak comes from this hilltop

471
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,180
Just go down the whole valley

472
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,980
So what happened?

473
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,980
an arrow like this

474
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,100
This is a tax leak, just go down this valley

475
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,380
The one that digs low is like a river

476
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,080
So the main tax stones

477
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,780
that would go along these low valleys

478
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,680
but here it takes a turn

479
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,980
turn these stones

480
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,580
it's heavier, it goes this way

481
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,480
But what does this one arrow represent?

482
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,580
It's just ash, a lighter substance

483
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,480
it has no friction against the ground

484
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,680
It's coming straight from here, right here

485
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,480
Then rush over here is the village

486
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,280
There is a primary school in the village

487
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,180
Let's see what's going on in this elementary school

488
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,180
this is this

489
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
This crumb came from here

490
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,600
so we are

491
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,040
crumbs have from this

492
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,800
Come over from the back of the classroom

493
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,200
Of course you can see the glass

494
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,320
all

495
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,440
by that

496
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,640
those with crumbs

497
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,440
break it apart

498
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
Whole

499
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
but if you look

500
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,360
the other side

501
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,600
what can you see

502
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,920
this is

503
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,200
Lee doors and windows

504
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,640
You can imagine how hot that temperature is

505
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,680
That's volcanic ash

506
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,120
that hundreds of degrees of temperature

507
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,520
come in an instant

508
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Li Menchuang

509
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,840
That's the same temperature

510
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,720
deformed throughout

511
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
so you imagine saying this thing

512
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
very hot stuff

513
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,280
Li doors and windows are deformed

514
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,400
you can imagine people

515
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,600
or all these houses

516
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,200
General traditional wooden or house

517
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,440
It burns in an instant

518
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,960
That's actually

519
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,160
Silver Circle volcano on top of history

520
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
In fact, for Japan

521
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,560
very, very many hard lessons

522
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,840
this 1792

523
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,880
Fifteen thousand deaths from this

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,700
why hundreds of years ago

525
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,300
This is actually a worthwhile

526
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,200
One of these natural disasters around the world

527
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,400
This model of understanding

528
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,900
then how could this be

529
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,100
That's when the volcano erupted

530
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
Just like the eruption of Xiahaoyi volcano just now

531
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,500
cause an earthquake of about seven

532
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Then this earthquake of course the damage of the earthquake

533
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,600
we can imagine

534
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,900
even more frightening

535
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,700
He put the other side of this silver announcement

536
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,100
there was a mountain

537
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,000
shake it all down

538
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,700
He just slides into the sea

539
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,800
If it slips into the sea, it will generate a tsunami

540
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,700
So this typical

541
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,800
A compound disaster is a volcano, an earthquake, three eruptions and a tsunami

542
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,300
15,000 people

543
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,500
probably more than ten thousand people

544
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,900
They all died from the impact of this tsunami

545
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,200
Then this is Yinxuan Volcano in Kyushu

546
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,300
he is here

547
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,700
So you see this to this landslide to

548
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,200
Ocean

549
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,240
In fact, all the residents of the surrounding seaside villages in the Inner Sea suffered disaster.

550
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
That's why there are so many casualties

551
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,240
So the Fowles disaster is now more familiar to everyone.

552
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Like Japan's Three World Wars and One Earthquake

553
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,240
We all know about earthquakes, tsunamis, river disasters

554
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,240
River disasters may actually be more beautiful and perfect than earthquakes and tsunamis

555
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,240
So that is to say, from the very beginning of this event

556
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,240
In fact, the most serious thing is the last one

557
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,240
So the Fuers disaster is actually relevant to what we are talking about now.

558
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
This disaster prevention is very important

559
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
if i know soon what's going on with this

560
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,240
I have time to avoid subsequent actions

561
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
or some disaster

562
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Therefore, Fuers disaster is a very important concept for disaster prevention in the world.

563
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Well, let's talk about this same thing, which of course hasn't happened yet.

564
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
This is what many American advanced European scientists worry about

565
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,240
This is Africa This is North America South America

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,160
On the west coast of Africa there is a volcanic island

567
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,760
volcanic islands likewise they serve as

568
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
When the volcano erupts, the volcanic island will collapse

569
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,960
or these very steep terrain

570
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,760
As long as it collapses, there will be a tsunami

571
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Then the scientist is free to do some simulations

572
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,520
but scary

573
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,000
look at these numbers

574
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,360
it's 132 meters

575
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,360
Which city or 132 us if

576
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,960
In Shancheng Princess, we may all soak in the sea here

577
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,280
inside sea water

578
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
That

579
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,720
Although in the west of Africa

580
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,360
But New York and Boston in the United States

581
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,160
or many cities on the east coast

582
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,120
As long as this tsunami comes

583
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,020
This is really out of hand

584
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,680
It is a great threat to mankind and the United States

585
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,960
Will this be a serious problem?

586
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,680
Now none of us can tell

587
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,200
but what day is the real volcanic activity

588
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,360
become a disaster caused by a tsunami

589
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,360
is a question worth thinking about

590
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,740
Although every week in Africa seems to have nothing to do with us

591
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,220
I especially take the opportunity to point out

592
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,380
That is to say, everyone knows about Guishan Island.

593
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
I didn't talk about Guishan Island today

594
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,300
But Guishan Island is outside the Big Butt Volcano

595
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,620
volcanically active volcanic island in taiwan

596
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,340
If you have been to Guishan Island

597
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,980
You can see that these terrains are very steep

598
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,340
If a volcanic event takes this piece

599
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,100
array it like this

600
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,460
This is of course a simulation

601
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,380
It also creates waves or tsunamis

602
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,340
In particular, our Yilan Plain is actually very flat, right?

603
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,460
Waves of five meters may occur on the Yilan Plain

604
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,740
is the tsunami

605
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,580
Maybe the beach is the same

606
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,020
if ten meters

607
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,140
There is no need for a third of Yilan to be soaked in water

608
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,860
Well, of course we don't want this to happen.

609
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,060
But what happens in nature is not whether we rest or not

610
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,060
that we have to be prepared

611
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,220
Can't wait until we wish it didn't happen

612
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,500
back to this volcanic disaster

613
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,200
The world trends I just told you about are the scariest.

614
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,500
That Long Yanliu is like this Xia Fuyi

615
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,500
dragon smoke is hot but it's not scary

616
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,000
there's a little bit of what's actually it's slow

617
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
you see it you run probably past it

618
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Therefore, the disaster of Longyanliu is actually relatively limited.

619
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The other thing is that we mentioned the earthquake just now.

620
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,500
Let's talk about the volcanic glow and mudflow

621
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Special Volcano Hui we just talked about

622
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Don't talk about the flow of the world, dragons and smoke are all at close range

623
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
it's only dangerous if you touch it

624
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
But Volcano is not

625
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,500
it can go far

626
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
cause you a lot of trouble

627
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,000
This was also last month

628
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yindao volcano erupts again

629
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,500
Luer Island next to it is Yin Island

630
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
This is Lugoshima City

631
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,000
The city of Luer Island has probably remained the same, with about 500,000 people.

632
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,500
small cities

633
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
this volcanic glow

634
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The sound instructor is very active

635
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm going to the audio guide

636
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
5 to 10 times

637
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
i won't remember

638
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
about twice

639
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
There will be a volcanic glow once

640
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I have a high memory

641
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I often go to see the volcanic glow

642
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It's coming up like a chimney

643
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
What about the result?

644
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
this lure tutor is like this

645
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This is either going to sea or volcanic glow

646
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So Mr. Lure is very used to

647
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This Volcanic Fai follows them

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
live together

649
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That

650
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Mount Aso two years ago

651
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Just the whole surrounding city

652
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
The car is all covered

653
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
This of course just causes you

654
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
life is very inconvenient

655
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
It will not cause your life and property

656
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
big threat

657
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
That's a small volcanic eruption

658
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But the volcano had a big eruption

659
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
eruptions smaller than

660
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like this one in the 900 million year old Philippines

661
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Pinglaotupu erupts here

662
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
This is where Manila is located

663
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Usually Tupu is in

664
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,140
This volcano has actually been in the past ten or twenty years

665
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,940
Already a relatively large volcano

666
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,740
what effect it has

667
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,440
because this volcano is very lucky

668
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,340
why lucky

669
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:21,240
Because the United States has a so-called air base in the Philippines

670
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,580
That's Clark Air Force Base.

671
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,540
They were two weeks before the eruption

672
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,700
Because the USGS in the United States helped with the investigation

673
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,700
Because of the problem with their F-16 fighter jets

674
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,540
So they found out they couldn't do it.

675
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,240
This volcano should erupt within ten days

676
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,000
All the F-16s at Clark AFB have flown away

677
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,540
only this one left

678
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,800
This is a broken plane

679
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,700
it can't run so keep it

680
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,040
So a lot of volcanoes were built

681
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,940
This is a very successful

682
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,400
Successful examples of volcano monitoring

683
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,000
Of course, the United States and the Philippines

684
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
result of cooperation

685
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
then look at this

686
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Although this has these volcanic ash at close range

687
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But this volcanic ash is not only

688
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Will it affect the vicinity?

689
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
you see this is

690
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
this before the eruption

691
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
tens of kilometers of this

692
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
These ash

693
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
june eruption

694
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
all turn red

695
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That volcanic ash drifts to

696
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
very very high peak go

697
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
then you see this is

698
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
august to december

699
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
slowly recovered

700
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
restore to original

701
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So about half a year

702
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The whole of this volcanic ash is in

703
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
high up on earth

704
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
With the wind

705
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Although this is

706
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Larger volcanoes this year

707
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But if you follow history

708
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It is the kind of big volcanic eruption in the historical era

709
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
can take the whole earth

710
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
of

711
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the whole atmosphere is covered

712
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
do not come in

713
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
creatures of the earth

714
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
or

715
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
will even become extinct

716
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,400
This is history

717
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,100
That's what the historical evidence says

718
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,300
extinction of some creatures

719
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,900
In fact, it may be related to the volcano

720
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,800
Large volcanic eruptions are closely related

721
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
well that

722
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,700
In 2011 this Icelandic volcano

723
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,500
Maybe everyone has the impression

724
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
So a volcano erupts

725
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,000
The entire volcano will float to the continent of Europe

726
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,600
All flights across continental Europe are grounded

727
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,700
The whole traveler

728
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,100
or the economy

729
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,500
They assess a whole bunch of losses

730
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,300
Then this is a bigger volcano

731
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,500
In fact, it's not just the effect of close range.

732
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,400
In fact, all human beings will be affected

733
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,900
Let's see how much it erupts

734
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,900
That

735
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,100
Probably the largest volcano is nothing more than this one

736
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,100
this is america

737
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,700
above the address they have three different colors

738
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,700
That's 2.2 million years

739
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,700
1.32 million years

740
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
640,000 years

741
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Area covered by three eruptions of different ages

742
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Geologist doing occupational survey

743
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
outlined

744
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So there's a super nutrition store under Yellowstone Park

745
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
This also has a movie in production

746
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
It's also very sensational

747
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
or very scary

748
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So the United States is actually very important to this Yellowstone Park.

749
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
is very, very serious to treat

750
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Why

751
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Of course you divide 2.2 by 13

752
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
About once every 700,000 years

753
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So last time it was 640,000

754
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
seems to be coming soon

755
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If round by cycle

756
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
If it is true, it represents their age

757
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Seems like it's about to erupt

758
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
This is the result of a supervolcano

759
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Volcanic ash certainly has a big impact

760
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Let's go back to this lahar

761
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,080
That's the lahar flow in Colombia, Central America.

762
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,940
What is a volcanic mudflow? We have it in Taiwan

763
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,040
Everyone knows this landslide

764
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,040
It's just water, mud, or he just flows down

765
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,040
It's even scarier at the volcano

766
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,040
volcanic ash is lighter

767
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
so it is easier to flow

768
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,040
And the ash is very thick in the volcanic area

769
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,040
So all at once the whole mudslide comes over

770
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
that's especially this

771
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,040
This is in the mountains of Central America

772
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,080
Usually like Yushan

773
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,080
or higher these mountains

774
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,080
it is covered with snow

775
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,080
But once the volcano came up,

776
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Is a high temperature with ice, snow, dragon

777
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
When you touch some of that snow, it will melt

778
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
produce a lot of water

779
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Then the water brings down the ash

780
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,080
The whole shock

781
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,120
There are tens of thousands of people

782
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This is because it was far away from us in China and the United States.

783
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But in fact, the transmission of information

784
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
if you look carefully

785
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
this is

786
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
There will be such a big disaster in five or ten years

787
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
will run out

788
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
that mud flow is like this

789
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
the whole of this

790
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Landslides in the South before Typhoon August 8

791
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
In fact, after the main disaster of these rivers

792
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Then the water goes into the village

793
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
flooding

794
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
This is the moment when the volcano erupts

795
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Just so we said volcanic ash lahars

796
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
volcanic ash

797
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Water leaks, this is an instant disaster

798
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But this mudslide

799
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
this is endless

800
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Why

801
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
just a typhoon

802
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
water comes

803
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
just bring a mudslide

804
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
especially the philippines

805
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Philippines at every turn

806
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
as long as a typhoon comes

807
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Of course we are in Taiwan

808
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
are often threatened by typhoons

809
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But like the brand is the one next to me

810
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
that is

811
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
The volcanic ash is carried all the time

812
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
the river

813
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,300
Then the whole flood was changed to a lot of villages

814
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,500
that may be thirty years

815
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,300
That volcano will not be taken away

816
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,300
Then keep repeating these

817
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,800
menacing thing

818
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,300
well that

819
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,700
Give a general introduction to Vesvi and Pompeii or volcanoes

820
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,500
We will go directly back to our Taipei and Mainland China

821
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,000
Of course this is imaginary

822
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,800
This is our 101 Dalun Volcano in Taipei Basin

823
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,400
What if the Great Looming erupted?

824
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,200
These dragonfly flows, crater flows, or lahars

825
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Anyway, Xianjian Huohuo may all go to the Taipei Basin

826
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,900
Then if these dragon flies block the entrance of Guandu

827
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,900
Danshui and Keelung can't get out

828
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,400
Will there be this legendary Kangxi Taipei Lake?

829
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
won't run out

830
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,400
So as long as it happens there is a possibility

831
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,200
The distance is actually

832
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,800
I really hope to connect 101 with Qixing Mountain

833
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
In fact, we think the most likely to live

834
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
active area

835
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,400
Well, it's actually less than 15 kilometers

836
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,900
is a very very short distance

837
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,400
Very short straight line distance

838
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
You can imagine the volcano bit coming up

839
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,900
The whole of Taipei probably

840
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,900
with the guide for

841
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,200
The city next to it has almost the same impact

842
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,500
Then we also do a little bit of simulation

843
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,200
This is assuming that there is a volcanic eruption in Qixing Mountain

844
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,400
What will happen to Longweiliu

845
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,200
This is the simulated location

846
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,600
Then you give me a little closer look

847
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,100
The different colors are its thickness

848
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,000
or its area of ​​influence

849
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,200
Then don't look carefully at this

850
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,000
because you'll see

851
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,700
where is my home

852
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,000
then i will

853
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,700
In fact, I have always

854
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,800
I made it about four or five years ago

855
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,500
I have never dared to show off

856
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,300
Until recently because volcanoes in the sea have been

857
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,200
Is it legislation?

858
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,800
When the government is going to face

859
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,000
so

860
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,700
This is for reference only

861
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,300
that's for

862
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
If it's Mount Suzui, it's underground, it's Jinshan

863
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Just to the north, we know that Jinshan is very productive.

864
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
In fact, many people are very concerned

865
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Will it have an impact on very productive

866
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I don't comment on this

867
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
just do a little mock work

868
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
that of course affects the range

869
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It all depends on the amount it erupts, right?

870
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
It erupts a little bit, of course it has a very small area of ​​effect

871
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
If the amount of eruption is large

872
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It certainly has a large reach

873
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
that eruption is small

874
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
now we don't know

875
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but i'll tell you later

876
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
if it

877
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
erupting next month

878
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I have a very high chance

879
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
will tell everyone

880
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Will the eruption be big or small

881
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
This is an opinion with some scientific estimates

882
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
well, this volcanic ash

883
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It is also what people often talk about

884
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This is the public health teacher of CUHK

885
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
help with some simulations

886
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
In fact, he did it 365 days a year

887
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
According to different seasons, different directions

888
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
when the volcano comes up

889
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
how should it float

890
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,900
Then of course we have 365 days of data

891
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,700
we are all running

892
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,400
I'm here only spring and autumn

893
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,500
Of course spring, summer, autumn and winter are different

894
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,200
Every day actually has something to do with the direction of the wind

895
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,300
That was six years ago

896
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,400
When our TVO was established

897
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,100
we just want to say

898
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,300
If the volcano erupts that day

899
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,500
How should volcanic ash spread?

900
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,000
Just go to Japan to this

901
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,500
Spread in this direction of Hainan Island

902
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,600
This is an impression

903
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Just tell these phenomena

904
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,300
Okay, we talked for a long time

905
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,400
Actually that's what I've been saying

906
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
if if if the volcano erupts

907
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,200
if a volcano erupts

908
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,600
but the real problem is

909
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,700
Will continental volcanoes erupt?

910
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,300
then this is back to us

911
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,100
serious scientific question

912
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,400
And we have been for about ten years

913
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,300
A group of people trying to find the answer

914
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,200
before finding the answer

915
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,500
when i was a student

916
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,600
words read by people in ninth science

917
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,020
So I can know that this is our terrain group in Taipei

918
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,120
The red area is the fire dust rock

919
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,020
Huochen rock is the dragon rock that represents the eruption of the volcano on the surface.

920
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,520
igneous rock body

921
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,020
So this is probably like this

922
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,960
Because in Taiwan we don't have

923
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,460
There is no record of volcanic eruptions in history

924
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,100
So most people want to say a volcanic eruption

925
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,760
Taiwan dare not do our things

926
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Taipei will never

927
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,960
But according to geologists to do some dating of these red stones in this area

928
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,160
The so-called dating is to find out the age of its eruption

929
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Was it 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago, or 1,000,000 years ago?

930
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
They can do it based on that parity year

931
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,560
Do the comparison and get the result

932
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,060
This is an old picture from the 1980s

933
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,960
That could have had a little eruption about a million years ago

934
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,760
At the time of 800,000 years, the

935
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,660
Volcanoes began to emerge from Dalin Volcano

936
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,460
then four hundred thousand years more

937
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,060
Then came this hundred thousand years

938
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I feel like it stopped

939
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Therefore, because the data are provided for 100,000 years

940
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
There is no data for 0.1 million years

941
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So there is no eruption in history

942
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
This address home tells us that 100,000 years

943
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
seems to be gone

944
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
So for a long, long time in the past

945
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's been a long time, everyone, the mainland is very common

946
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Continental Volcanoes or Yangmingshan National Park

947
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
just to play

948
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
it's not threatening to us

949
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But about ten years of work

950
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
If we go to mainland volcanoes to see

951
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
This is a surface fumarole hot spring, right?

952
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
This is a typical volcanic area

953
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Especially this geochemical analysis

954
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
This is the work done by professors from Taiwan and Taiwan.

955
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
He is still equal to the pioneer

956
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
He did some of these chemical analyzes of the fumaroles

957
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
just tell us

958
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That thing is not a feature of the surface

959
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
but what

960
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
If the earth is not deep, the earth is slow

961
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
That's Teacher Yang Cannan

962
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Di Xiaohua learns from the perspective of the flower, it looks like it is alive

963
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But no one does physics

964
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
so he advised me to do it

965
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
At that time, I just came back from a year-long visit to Japan

966
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Saw a lot of volcanoes in Japan

967
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I just jump in and do it

968
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Then I jumped in and now I can't come back

969
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
more and more miracles

970
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Then anyway, I will cast the Earthquake King

971
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
so i watched a lot

972
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
There are many, many earthquakes in Dalian Mountain

973
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Then in these earthquakes

974
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
What particularly attracts me is

975
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
There are quite a few volcanic earthquakes to see

976
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
The traditional ones are general fault earthquakes and volcanic earthquakes

977
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Its shape and its physical properties are completely different

978
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
He has someone to introduce a few

979
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Then, like this air-made radar, you can see the crater burst

980
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
it's all new

981
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
the rep said it wasn't weathered

982
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
didn't get overshadowed by the 10th

983
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
mean it's new

984
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Then the level car two is Japan one

985
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
A queen uncle of mine used to sit with me

986
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
There may be rises and falls

987
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It means he seems to be moving

988
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
rather than stable

989
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Then this date is special

990
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
last most important

991
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
this was before

992
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Deputy Director Chen Zonghua

993
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
He took him to Russia

994
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
found a german

995
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I found it because Russia is also full of volcanoes.

996
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Then comes the year of the Volcano Society

997
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Because we don't have the

998
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
very good expert

999
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
So I invite these foreign scholars to help

1000
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
he decided probably

1001
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
five thousand to six thousand years

1002
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Anyway, he made a mistake.

1003
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But whether it's five thousand or six thousand

1004
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
This means a lot

1005
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
What does that mean

1006
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
In the Republic of China

1007
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
In 1999

1008
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
We will hold a meeting of experts and scholars at the Geological Survey Institute

1009
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Then we put Chancellor Volcano

1010
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
discussed for a long time

1011
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Although there are very

1012
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
strong dispute

1013
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Some people say Yes and No

1014
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Some people say that ordinary volcanoes

1015
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Volcanoes are all over the world

1016
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,500
extinct or active volcano

1017
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,000
Natalon Volcano

1018
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,500
The result of our final discussion is that

1019
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
dormant volcano

1020
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
What is a dormant volcano

1021
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
it is a volcano

1022
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,500
but it's sleeping now

1023
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,500
It may not wake up one day

1024
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,500
Then this living Huohuo Songshan

1025
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
What is the name of the volcano?

1026
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Like Xia Haoyi

1027
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
You can go to see that magma anytime

1028
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,500
Or go to Aso Volcano

1029
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,500
it's smoking

1030
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
boot smoke

1031
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
This is a living volcano

1032
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
So the Great Looming is

1033
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
is alive

1034
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
It looks like there is no activity

1035
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Then with this result

1036
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,500
So this is the definition of volcanology

1037
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
that is

1038
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Active in ten thousand years

1039
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,500
you have this record

1040
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I classify it as a volcano

1041
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500
just have a bad record

1042
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,500
special tube

1043
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
pay attention to it

1044
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,500
This is the experience above

1045
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
But the phenomenon is

1046
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
I personally feel the phenomenon

1047
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
It doesn't have to be more scientifically meaningful.

1048
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,500
That is, if you can confirm that there is a magma chamber

1049
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,460
like this yellowstone scientist said

1050
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,100
There is a big magma chamber underneath

1051
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,460
of course it's alive

1052
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,300
If Yellowstone Park just talked about

1053
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,100
The last major eruption was 640,000 years ago

1054
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,360
This is very big, 10,000 years, that should be

1055
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,400
10 volcanic

1056
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,860
But Yellowstone can't use rules of thumb

1057
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,500
law of phenomena

1058
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,960
It's the magma chamber that you found

1059
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,060
live without meaning

1060
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,260
This is a general definition of something like

1061
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,060
After that with the process

1062
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,860
In fact, for the past five or six years

1063
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,760
every time because i do adult volcano

1064
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,360
Tell the Ministry of Science and Technology that this is a volcano

1065
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,020
Looks like I'm a volcano

1066
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,360
At that time, the natural Sisi of the Ministry of Science and Technology

1067
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Chen Yigao

1068
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,560
He is also the 17th of National Taiwan University

1069
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,360
we are still mature

1070
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,220
every time i meet you i say

1071
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,720
Lin Zheng, where are the volcanic magma chambers?

1072
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
When you meet me, ask me where the magma chamber is

1073
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,720
I was asked by him for five or six years

1074
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,460
then i always wanted to talk

1075
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,420
In fact, I probably have a spectrum how to do it

1076
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,860
but no evidence

1077
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,560
Then I thought

1078
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,840
think of a very simple concept

1079
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,040
Just use the shadow of the magma chamber

1080
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,540
The concept of this shadow is very simple

1081
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,840
we see the shadow of this plane

1082
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,480
We don't need to look up to know

1083
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,940
There was a plane in the sky

1084
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,000
Because the sun hits the plane

1085
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,680
If you can't penetrate it, there is a shadow on the surface

1086
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,080
it's clear

1087
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
The X-ray on the medical

1088
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:27,540
Everyone, this X-ray hits the bone

1089
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,940
Different from tissue because of fine absorption

1090
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,940
So if the finger breaks off

1091
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,780
see the crack

1092
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,880
So this is because of the X-ray test

1093
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,780
difference between tissue and bone

1094
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,640
Come on, earth science actually started more than 100 years ago

1095
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,280
There is such a concept that

1096
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,980
when the earthquake happened

1097
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,880
Earth science has long known that

1098
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,000
This external cooperation is

1099
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,200
out of code it is a liquid

1100
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,740
This is 2900 kilometers from the surface to the outside

1101
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,980
is a very, very deep distance

1102
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,440
But why do scientists know it's a liquid

1103
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,360
It is based on the shadow of the S wave

1104
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,600
Seismic waves hit the red part

1105
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,680
you can see in this section

1106
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,560
There is this S wave signal

1107
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,360
but you have this one on the back

1108
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,880
brown side

1109
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,640
You can't find a straight S wave

1110
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,080
because of what

1111
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,160
S wave blocked by Out of Code

1112
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,520
It's just a liquid substance, it can't go through it.

1113
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,160
S waves can't penetrate

1114
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,200
then this maybe

1115
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,520
To put it simply, let me tell you

1116
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,520
This is the P wave

1117
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,000
when there is an earthquake

1118
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,240
Anyway, elastic waves will produce P and S

1119
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,200
This is a heavy or compression wave

1120
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,960
it's a bump

1121
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,200
Look at this black

1122
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,800
it shrinks and then stretches

1123
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,600
It's like hitting a pool ball

1124
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,360
So the energy is transferred in one

1125
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,560
What is the S wave

1126
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,960
S wave is like dead

1127
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,080
it's twisted it's clipped

1128
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,560
So one is a linear motion

1129
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,320
one is twisting sideways

1130
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,560
This is of course simpler, for the sake of simplicity

1131
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,280
That is to say, if the left side is a solid

1132
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,680
on the right is a liquid

1133
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,480
What is the difference between solid and liquid

1134
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,520
The solid is the gap between each molecule and the powder oil molecule

1135
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,600
Well caught by this chemical piece

1136
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,240
it can't run around

1137
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,880
Meaning you're on my left is on the left

1138
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,080
you can't run to the right

1139
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,440
But the liquid, the liquid, you can run as you please

1140
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,680
is liquid or gas

1141
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,040
It means that it doesn't have these sugar yellows, so it is gradually grasping

1142
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,800
So what do these two different behaviors cause?

1143
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,120
P4 If you turn around from this side by external force

1144
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,200
it will

1145
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,920
it will hit this

1146
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:41,840
then this hits this

1147
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,440
this hit this

1148
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
So P4 will transfer energy

1149
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,560
Then you when this one comes running

1150
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,600
This S wave because it has sugar yellow

1151
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,720
it will pull over

1152
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,960
its sugar yellow will elongate

1153
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,600
so this will bring

1154
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,680
then take one by one

1155
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,560
So the S wave will pass like this

1156
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,520
So when solid

1157
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,040
Both P and S pass

1158
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,080
but when the liquid

1159
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
P wave is a transfer, S wave because the two have no relationship

1160
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So this hole will not move

1161
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
To give a very simple ratio, everyone sitting here

1162
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
If we hold hands, we are solid

1163
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
when one of them leans back

1164
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The one next to it will also pull on it

1165
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
so it will pull one by one

1166
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So this is the characteristic of S wave

1167
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
If we don't hold hands, it will be liquid

1168
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
one of them lay forward

1169
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Lean forward, the one next to it will not be disturbed

1170
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
is a property of solid liquids

1171
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
According to this, we can test that

1172
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
What kind of liquid or solid exists in the earth

1173
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
just

1174
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well, what we imagine is that

1175
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Except for out of core, the earth is liquid outside

1176
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Neihe , not this magma chamber

1177
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
It should be that the magma with high temperature is liquid

1178
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So I was thinking that S wave will definitely disappear after hitting this point.

1179
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
right

1180
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Alright, then I set up a lot of earthquake chairs here in Yangmingshan.

1181
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Then take advantage of the very deep bottom

1182
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We have many large and deep earthquakes off the coast of Yilan

1183
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and then straight up from the bottom

1184
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
then hit our area

1185
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Then I went to check which one had S wave and which one didn't.

1186
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You can see these earthquake stations in blue

1187
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It can all see S waves

1188
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
The only areas that are red

1189
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
it can't see s waves

1190
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Of course, P wave and S wave look like everyone

1191
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
is a bit professional

1192
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
but it's not that hard

1193
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I put the record of red and blue on the next one

1194
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
The following is the arrival of the P wave

1195
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Then the S wave arrives and it's very clear

1196
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But when the seismic waves hit this magma chamber

1197
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
The P wave can pass through to the S wave and cannot be found at all.

1198
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,900
It just disappears, disappears, and there is a shadow

1199
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,400
So this four-one picture means

1200
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
When hitting the magma chamber, the S wave disappeared

1201
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
S wave will run out when you miss it

1202
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,400
So according to this it is simple

1203
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,900
Let's just draw a cartoon

1204
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,900
The magma chamber is here, if you hit this

1205
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,900
You can't see the yellow side

1206
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,900
was blocked

1207
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,900
if this is true

1208
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
We also double-check that

1209
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,900
If the magma chamber is here

1210
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,400
S waves can't pass through, but P waves

1211
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,400
What about heavy waves, heavy waves, solid liquids, it’s fine

1212
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,400
it can penetrate

1213
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,400
although it can penetrate

1214
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,400
but it gets slower

1215
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,400
because it is liquid

1216
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
so it goes slower

1217
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,400
So I'll walk here together as sidekicks

1218
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
these two it only goes here

1219
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
This is the four one picture

1220
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,400
But it's clear

1221
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Let's see the earthquake hit here

1222
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,400
We got a signal on the surface

1223
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,400
Then this is simulated

1224
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
If you hit the magma chamber here it will slow down

1225
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,400
Then the S wave disappeared

1226
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
On the right hand side is our observation

1227
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,400
The distance that will be written every time a wave hits the magma chamber

1228
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,400
in this dark place

1229
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
will appear here to arrive

1230
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,200
But as soon as you hit the magma door

1231
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
it won't be here

1232
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,200
it's a little slow

1233
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,700
So you look at the S wave and don't see it

1234
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,200
Then the P wave is tired again

1235
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,700
for me

1236
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,200
this is no doubt space

1237
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,900
There is a liquid substance under the ground

1238
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,500
The liquid substance has said

1239
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
Not necessarily magma or water

1240
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,500
That's impossible

1241
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,700
Why

1242
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,900
At 20 kilometers the water will be squeezed out

1243
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:24,800
magma

1244
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,300
Its density is closer to that of stone

1245
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,500
it can be kept

1246
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,900
so it can't be water

1247
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,600
Of course magma is the best and only explanation

1248
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,700
Then its size is about

1249
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,300
GOO!

1250
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,200
70 square kilometers

1251
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,800
How big is 70 square kilometers

1252
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,500
is its area

1253
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:45,500
About a quarter of the size of the administrative district of Taipei City

1254
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,900
Let's all do something

1255
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,200
A little bigger than Siling District

1256
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,900
It is slightly smaller than Xinyi Songshan Nangang in the East District

1257
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,100
what's the point of this

1258
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,100
As long as a region of a local kilometer

1259
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
so come on lava

1260
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
probably just like

1261
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
The pavement is so big before reaching Pinya

1262
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
possible to st seabee st helens

1263
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
erupt a little bigger

1264
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that would be terrible

1265
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
so instead of saying

1266
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
All this magma goes to the surface

1267
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Actually it's only 1%

1268
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
a percentage to the surface

1269
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
In fact, the volcano will erupt

1270
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's dangerous and powerful

1271
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Well, of course this is

1272
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Because of the results of these studies

1273
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So the central

1274
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
except the legislature

1275
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Then the Executive Yuan

1276
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
have done some coping with this

1277
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So elegant planning for volcanic disasters

1278
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
no matter central place now

1279
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
must follow above

1280
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Some mechanisms of this strain

1281
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
good though

1282
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
find the magma chamber

1283
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
but for me

1284
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
In fact, the challenge is greater

1285
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
The reason is that this is

1286
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
What we call Huang Xinhua

1287
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
this colleague did

1288
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
at this

1289
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Made by Huang's Park

1290
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
There's a magma chamber under it

1291
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
there is a

1292
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
that's in taiwan

1293
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
I think it's 20 kilometers

1294
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
what we see is this

1295
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
In fact, I am more worried about whether there is a potential

1296
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Because our resolution is limited

1297
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
so I dare not speak

1298
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Does the upper crust have

1299
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So the Ministry of Science and Technology gave me an order to continue looking for

1300
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Let's come up with a big plan

1301
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
At the ninth month they are

1302
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We are in the secret spicy earthquake war in northern Taiwan

1303
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I hope that Minister Hill and Guishan Island

1304
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Find it in the magma chambers of these two volcanoes

1305
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
In fact, we also found the magma chamber on Guishan Island.

1306
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
The article is under review

1307
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
should be out soon

1308
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So there is definitely a magma reservoir under Guishan

1309
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So we want to take this size depth

1310
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Hope to find it out

1311
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So I hope to finish this project in four years

1312
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
This is the black street station of our first year department

1313
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Then the next year I hope to fill the white

1314
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Then the third year and the fourth year

1315
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I can actually do some analysis and research

1316
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
good

1317
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Next is this TVO

1318
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
this volcano

1319
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,060
looks alive

1320
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,620
eruption cannot be ruled out

1321
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,720
what shall we do

1322
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,560
This fear is often rooted in ignorance

1323
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,860
This is the Aso volcano just mentioned in Japan

1324
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,440
There are railroad houses and a lot of residents inside.

1325
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,560
This is a big crater

1326
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,460
people live in it

1327
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,220
Lived for decades or hundreds of years, maybe a thousand years

1328
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,320
they didn't panic

1329
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,120
live inside the crater

1330
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,960
where is the reason

1331
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,400
This one is more interesting

1332
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,960
This is the eruption of Xiahao clam on May 1st

1333
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,160
Director Chen of the NCD

1334
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,360
just send me this one and say wow this one

1335
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,360
super nice look

1336
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,200
This old beauty seems very handsome

1337
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,300
The volcano is covered in ashes

1338
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,600
He also raised his voice over there

1339
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,000
The reason is that they are not afraid

1340
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,360
The reason not to be afraid is not because you have courage

1341
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,200
because of something

1342
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,760
with this backing

1343
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,560
This is the station of Xiahaoli Volcano Pass

1344
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,960
Bottom this next to this

1345
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,960
less than 100 meters

1346
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
When I visited last year, I asked him

1347
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
How deep is your crater along the river?

1348
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
He said three kilometers

1349
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I said three kilometers, how dare you live here

1350
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
This has a history of 100 years

1351
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Why

1352
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Volcanic eruption will not be instant

1353
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
There will be actions and warnings

1354
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So they can have a good grasp

1355
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
so they pass

1356
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Earth science regardless of the air

1357
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
All kinds of monitoring on the surface or underground

1358
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
as long as there is movement

1359
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
we can

1360
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
before the volcano erupts

1361
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
there should be

1362
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
just like Visway's

1363
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
This is the oldest

1364
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
This one existed in 1841

1365
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
This is a very old painting

1366
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
that is the status quo

1367
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
this

1368
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Isn't Pompeii already destroyed?

1369
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Why is there still a volcanic view on the station?

1370
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
someone is

1371
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
sorry

1372
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
pompeii in

1373
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
South of Wesway

1374
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
To the north of him is Napolis

1375
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,920
So this also needs to be Watched

1376
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,040
to observe

1377
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,200
another day

1378
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,200
this volcano will

1379
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,160
It's bad luck for these people to come here

1380
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,600
so they have to monitor

1381
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,760
So we are at Datong Volcano

1382
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,440
We're going to set up an observatory

1383
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,040
This is the hardware provided by the teaching staff of Yang Mingzhang

1384
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,600
it's a nice environment

1385
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,120
we borrowed here

1386
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,320
Four or five Office

1387
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,880
Then build this observatory

1388
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,480
good

1389
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,240
At the beginning, the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of the Interior

1390
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,600
Because national industry belongs to the Ministry of the Interior

1391
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,600
We have a MEMO

1392
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,280
and then construct this

1393
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,560
So the Ministry of Science and Technology paid the main money

1394
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,080
Our Chinese is also the main person

1395
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,120
not only me

1396
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,000
Many technicians at our Earth Institute

1397
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,560
researchers participate in

1398
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,280
Ministry of Science and Technology

1399
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,840
The hardware equipment produced by the Ministry of the Interior

1400
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,560
Out of electricity, out of the house, out of these air conditioners

1401
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,280
so we just

1402
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,720
Because this is not actually a

1403
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,000
Very simple one unit can perform

1404
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,960
So we integrated a lot of

1405
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,160
That's where our observatory's instruments are located

1406
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,160
That's the triangular fault just mentioned

1407
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,660
This is the entire area of ​​Yangmingshan

1408
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,160
Conceptually this picture is us on the surface

1409
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,660
Many different instruments were deployed

1410
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,760
Includes seismographs, crustal deformation, geochemistry, geothermal jets

1411
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,860
I always hope that as long as the volcano has erupted before

1412
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,300
We believe that there should be some anomalies in these

1413
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,460
Then we have to report to the government, the people and everyone.

1414
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,960
Said the volcano may have started to restless

1415
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,460
That's our real-time monitoring station

1416
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,960
So we send a lot of real-time news to this screen for discussion

1417
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,300
Then this picture is the enlarged one just now

1418
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,860
This four-one picture is if people go up

1419
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,060
In fact, the surface and the crust will deform, right?

1420
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,620
be raised or arched

1421
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,020
We'll just lean on the GPS to level the camp

1422
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,120
we can measure the deformation of its crust

1423
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,140
And then here's like volcanic gas

1424
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,860
Because its concentration composition will also change

1425
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,920
It is conceivable that the temperature will also increase

1426
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,000
special seismic activity

1427
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Because my special session is doing earthquake activities

1428
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,500
seismic activity is

1429
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:14,000
Of course I know best

1430
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
and I believe the most useful

1431
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
a concept map

1432
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I don’t know if it’s usually 10 kilometers or 20 kilometers along the river.

1433
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Because there is heat along the river

1434
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
So there's a little bit of an earthquake on it

1435
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But if you run from A to B along the river like this

1436
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Only along the river will you run up

1437
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
what will happen to this incredible thing

1438
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Due to the change of temperature and pressure above

1439
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
There will be many, many earthquakes

1440
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
For example

1441
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Our Yangmingshan is now a month

1442
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
There may be only 3 or 5 earthquakes every day

1443
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
If you run up the river

1444
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
i predict or i imagine

1445
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
There may be 500 to 1000 earthquakes in one day

1446
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
That's obviously different

1447
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Our record map secretly shows earthquakes

1448
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,600
But when you see it, it means that there is a follow-up action

1449
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:07,600
when it goes up

1450
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,500
This is called a volcanic eruption.

1451
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,800
But you can say from B to C

1452
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:13,600
this earthquake

1453
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,900
At B, the earthquake may be 3 kilometers away

1454
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,000
1 kilometer left at C

1455
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Here maybe 5 kilometers or 10 kilometers

1456
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
what does this mean

1457
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,200
We only need the depth of the earthquake to determine it

1458
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,900
Must slowly change from deep to front

1459
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,700
it's maybe 20 days from here to here

1460
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:36,100
I know it runs 0.5 kilometers a day

1461
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,700
If it is 3 days from here to here

1462
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:42,100
I just saw it run 0.2km a day or something

1463
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,600
can i estimate

1464
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,900
I guess it's okay

1465
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,600
That could be 10 days or a week to the surface

1466
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,500
so i can't tell you guys

1467
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,000
Will there be a volcanic eruption next year?

1468
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,200
this time is too far

1469
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,300
I can't follow

1470
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,400
but

1471
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,600
But if say a month the volcano will

1472
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,100
Volcano erupts in a month

1473
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,500
I am sure I will see the exception

1474
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,800
I'll see a spike in these earthquakes

1475
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,000
Of course it's not just an earthquake.

1476
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,700
That is, the volcanic gas immediately deforms

1477
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,200
Low temperature, there should always be abnormalities in this

1478
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,000
When integrated, there should be good information to judge

1479
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,200
That also means that this is the approximate timeline

1480
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,800
I can roughly estimate how long it might take to reach the surface

1481
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,500
Similarly, if I see Huangzui Mountain

1482
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,500
Earthquakes are coming out of Huangzui Mountain

1483
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,300
I don't know that Huangzui Mountain may be delayed and approach the surface

1484
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,200
If it is in Dayoukeng

1485
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,100
I'm a big travel pit

1486
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,600
so i know something

1487
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,900
Then if I see big tour pit and small tour pit

1488
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,000
Why is Huangzuishan what city?

1489
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,500
The representative said wow, it was serious

1490
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,500
it's frontal, right?

1491
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
So the size time

1492
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,200
Probably scientifically, I can make an estimate

1493
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,300
So we did a lot of observations

1494
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,700
But of course there have been no volcanic eruptions so far

1495
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,400
it's very lucky

1496
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,000
but we

1497
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
even without a volcanic eruption

1498
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
we do scientific research

1499
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
We still found a lot of interesting things

1500
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
what is interesting

1501
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We are Earthquake Warfare

1502
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I will talk about the earthquake part

1503
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
this is

1504
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Each line is a record of 24 hours a day

1505
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
A black is 15 minutes

1506
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
then blue for an hour

1507
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
2 hours 24 hours

1508
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Show you 45 hours in the middle of the night

1509
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
The ground is shaking

1510
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
First I saw this 10 years ago

1511
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I just want to say

1512
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
that is the car

1513
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
what windswept hole

1514
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Anyway, there are many people in Yangmingshan

1515
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
but i want to say

1516
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The time pair is 10 o'clock in the middle of the night

1517
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
2:30 am

1518
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
impossible to have a car

1519
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
unless it's something weird

1520
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
That's science

1521
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
we certainly believe

1522
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
believe in science

1523
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So there should be no human activity

1524
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That should be this natural phenomenon

1525
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,020
Because if the pot is heating it up,

1526
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:04,140
when the pressure builds

1527
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,260
The lid of the pot is not related to the steam

1528
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,460
will it be a vibration

1529
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,160
The vibration is likely to be caused by

1530
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,200
The concept that the entire surface of the earth is shaking

1531
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,940
That's also very interesting

1532
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,160
This is also an earthquake station

1533
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,360
is one two three four

1534
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,760
Just look at a dozen earthquake stations

1535
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,760
send a signal at the same time

1536
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,260
Then this signal is called to look like a drop

1537
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,060
This is the water drop shape in the scientific community

1538
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:29,560
an earthquake record

1539
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,620
This is similar to the Chiayi Hualian earthquake

1540
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,120
completely different shape

1541
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,020
Chiayi Hualian these earthquakes look

1542
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,920
We look at P waves, S waves, and tangential body circles

1543
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,320
They all do this every day

1544
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,520
But this one can't see the P wave at all

1545
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:41,720
S wave sees one

1546
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,820
It's just a very special energy in the shape of a water drop.

1547
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,420
Then if you look closely at its frequency

1548
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,720
that's more interesting

1549
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,760
it is single frequency

1550
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,820
it's about three to a few hertz

1551
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,220
single frequency signal

1552
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:59,120
How can there be a single-frequency signal in nature?

1553
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,040
this is incredible

1554
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Of course it's simple. We want to say that everyone has played an instrument.

1555
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
If you strip one of the strings, it’s a single fret, right?

1556
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
That means it looks like someone is stripping a string in the ground

1557
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Of course it's impossible

1558
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Well, the real reason is

1559
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Because the magma under the ground actually has these cracks

1560
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
When the gas or liquid in these cracks

1561
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It just needs a change in pressure or a quick movement

1562
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
the whole rock wall will shake

1563
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
The frequency of shaking is determined by its width and length

1564
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
like stripping a string

1565
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
If the thickness and length of its strings are fixed

1566
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
its frequency is fixed

1567
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
the width of the crack

1568
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Its geometry is the same it is a single frequency

1569
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Then this is our real interpretation

1570
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
It also has a shape like a screw

1571
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
super image screw

1572
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
called english they called Tonillos

1573
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
this is

1574
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
This is very famous

1575
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
Anyone who knows about volcanic earthquakes

1576
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,760
Why

1577
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,600
In Central America just those volcanoes

1578
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,640
when they often erupt

1579
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,440
just see this first

1580
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,440
How long does it take for the volcano to erupt after seeing this allergy?

1581
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,240
So this becomes

1582
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,240
an indicator of a volcano in central america

1583
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:14,840
but can't say

1584
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,240
Taiwan sees this volcanic eruption

1585
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,640
Because different volcanoes behave differently

1586
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,440
some volcanic properties

1587
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,400
can be used as a reference

1588
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,440
But what we saw on Dalun Mountain

1589
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,900
Doesn't mean the volcano is going to erupt

1590
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,200
but it represents

1591
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,100
Some properties of volcano activity

1592
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,100
Then it's more interesting to see how often

1593
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,340
It is 2.1 4.2 6.3 8.4

1594
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:37,900
just a few special ones

1595
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:40,700
This multiplied signal is just

1596
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,740
Of course this is also a metaphor

1597
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,900
like this

1598
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,100
You went to pluck the pipa and plucked three strings

1599
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,740
Three different frequencies come out

1600
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:50,900
Of course there can't be

1601
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,100
these choices

1602
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,100
the same is

1603
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,200
you also have a

1604
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,340
extended to different enshrining times

1605
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,600
A column Bong is a frequency

1606
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,840
Column B is the frequency of series Bong

1607
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,800
it has since been blown to words

1608
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,000
When you bite it, it will come out with some fixed frequency

1609
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,900
that also has this low frequency

1610
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,700
In fact, its frequency is very low

1611
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:12,700
That's also very classic

1612
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,500
The usual breakthrough volcanic eruption just mentioned

1613
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,400
Do it for me on January 17th

1614
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,000
About 10 days before the eruption

1615
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,500
they see these things

1616
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,800
Hundreds of low-frequency earthquakes came out

1617
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,100
then finally they explained

1618
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,300
When the magma runs in the cracks of the rock

1619
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,100
low frequency signal

1620
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,100
So it's also a good indicator

1621
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:37,300
if dalun chapter we see a lot of this

1622
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,300
It's also a big warning sign

1623
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,100
There is also this Cheung Chau class

1624
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,100
In fact, there are quite a lot of pigs of this kind.

1625
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:48,100
I will speed up a little bit

1626
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:51,100
Okay, then let's take the original chairperson

1627
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:52,600
this confession

1628
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,800
Academician Li Rouxuan

1629
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,800
Later, our Institute of Earth Sciences

1630
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,300
Rescue director

1631
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,800
After he is here as the chief committee member,

1632
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,300
Let's finish this Volcano Watching Station

1633
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,300
Of course, the mission of the Volcano Watching Station is mainly for volcanic disasters

1634
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,300
But it actually seems to be a negative

1635
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,300
But there are also positive

1636
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,300
This volcanic resource, geothermal development

1637
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,300
In fact, they are two sides of the same body.

1638
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,300
If we take these magma

1639
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,300
These geothermal surveys are clear

1640
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,300
In fact, it can be applied

1641
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,300
Are those two Yamadas successful?

1642
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,300
what is the back garden

1643
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:29,300
very beautiful natural landscape

1644
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:32,300
that also has fumaroles

1645
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,300
The hole of exile is a landscape unique to these volcanoes

1646
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,300
different time periods

1647
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,300
Huang Wen during the day

1648
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,300
very beautiful

1649
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:45,300
These are some photos taken by our TVO colleagues over there

1650
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,300
It has snowed in the past two years

1651
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,300
It's also very rare

1652
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,300
Snow scene throughout our TVO

1653
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,300
that hot spring

1654
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,300
After having these beautiful landscapes

1655
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:00,300
if again

1656
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,780
Development of hot springs Development of Sidan

1657
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,800
An area that can provide better tourism, leisure and vacation

1658
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:13,800
That's these snow monkeys in Hokkaido, Japan

1659
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,900
They also know to take a hot spring when it's cold

1660
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,840
The largest geothermal development is Iceland

1661
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,940
In fact, besides enjoying these hot springs, Iceland

1662
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,040
They are also the world's geothermal development

1663
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:32,040
Probably more than 80% of Iceland's energy is geothermal.

1664
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,840
so they don't need a nuclear power plant

1665
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,640
Nuclear power plants don't need to burn coal

1666
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:37,640
they enjoy the natural

1667
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,040
Since Taiwan has these volcanic geothermal

1668
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:45,840
In fact, we should do some work on the concept

1669
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,840
So will continental volcanoes have geothermal development?

1670
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,840
In addition to this volcanic construction

1671
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:56,640
In fact, I also spent some time doing these tasks.

1672
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,740
We put up some seismic stations that look like

1673
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
There seems to be a big one here

1674
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,600
Hot discussion storage area

1675
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:09,200
If the science above this should be specifically

1676
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,200
Earthquake opening should be a good place

1677
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,800
But don't believe it's in a national park

1678
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:17,800
This environmental protection regulation may also design customer service

1679
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,000
But anyway this is

1680
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,800
Anyway, based on science, we can do some related things

1681
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,400
good

1682
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,600
The map part is more fun

1683
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,000
good

1684
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,600
this voice

1685
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,200
This is actually the media or something

1686
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,400
you may have the impression

1687
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,400
say in a while

1688
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,000
someone heard a strange sound

1689
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
then this is

1690
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,000
15 years is

1691
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,400
someone heard something

1692
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,600
anyway some description

1693
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,000
it means sound

1694
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,200
someone over here heard

1695
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,000
someone over here heard

1696
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,600
In fact, when the media came to ask us

1697
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,600
Actually, I probably have a clue

1698
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,400
But at that time it was not well organized

1699
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,400
so just pretend not to know

1700
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,400
But now I probably know

1701
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,200
also in history

1702
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,200
You see, this is 1835 and 53 years

1703
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
next day big butt

1704
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,640
three days

1705
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,400
it will be very noisy

1706
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,800
then we

1707
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,200
Since we do these our TBO colleagues

1708
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,040
Now I often call and say

1709
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,400
The teacher often hears place names today

1710
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,240
It's just that some people can hear it and some people can't.

1711
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,640
of course you really

1712
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,400
some say some don't

1713
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,600
is there any

1714
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,720
this

1715
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,080
we rely on evidence

1716
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,120
There are of course many reasons for place names

1717
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,000
There are places with earthquakes and various guitars

1718
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,400
Today we will talk about the place names of volcanoes

1719
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,160
This is our sacrifice

1720
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,200
this is about five minutes long

1721
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,280
but I say it as

1722
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,360
probably no more than five seconds

1723
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:42,360
the reason is because

1724
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,400
when everyone listens for five minutes

1725
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,840
probably fell asleep

1726
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,600
The first reason is to say

1727
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,480
if five minutes ago

1728
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,440
In fact, its frequency is very low

1729
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,720
you can't hear

1730
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,520
because our ears are from

1731
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,080
20Hz to 20,000Hz

1732
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:54,960
normal person

1733
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,960
If it is 10Hz

1734
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,240
we can't hear

1735
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,080
just too low frequency

1736
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
or too high frequency

1737
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So for everyone to hear

1738
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I'll take it a little

1739
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
This is called a dead sound

1740
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
turn five minutes into five seconds

1741
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
this is overclocking

1742
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But the five flavors are like a plane flying past

1743
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
but

1744
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
We use these signals

1745
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Actually, you see, this is a different kind of earthquake warfare

1746
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Why Earthquake Warfare Receives Sound

1747
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
In fact, the sound is the vibration of air

1748
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
air shaken to the surface

1749
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
our ruins on the surface

1750
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Shake our relics too

1751
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
because of shaking the ground

1752
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
shake relics

1753
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
So let's remember the signals

1754
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
We can see these earthquake shadows

1755
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You see this is every earthquake video received

1756
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Then we according to its sequence

1757
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
we can go and find out where it is

1758
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Like this example, we found it in Xiaoniu Pit

1759
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
very clear

1760
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I don't know if it's here or here

1761
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
perhaps

1762
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
The difference may be 10 meters 50 meters

1763
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
but not going outside the calf pit

1764
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
anyway

1765
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Shanhui is also here

1766
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Sure

1767
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:08,400
This is just about one hundred and two minutes

1768
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,000
I put it like two seconds

1769
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
you will hear

1770
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Actually look carefully at this

1771
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,600
In fact, this picture alone wrote an article on this

1772
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,600
This scientific international article

1773
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,200
I talked about this this is

1774
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
this is time

1775
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,800
this is the frequency

1776
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,900
This is when the whole thing explodes

1777
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,800
before the explosion

1778
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,400
It has frequencies from seventy grammes all the way down to almost forty grammes

1779
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,600
The frequency keeps going back and forth

1780
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,700
then give it a blast

1781
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,700
Actually very simple description

1782
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,900
It's like playing that heavy sky cannon when I was a child

1783
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,800
You chirp at one point and it explodes in the sky

1784
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,900
That's certainly not a heavy sky cannon

1785
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,200
This actually has good physics behind it

1786
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,800
Then we probably don't have time to talk about deeper things.

1787
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,400
In fact, Xiaoerkeng often records these things

1788
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,600
That child's pit is more interesting

1789
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,900
This is the location of the children's pit

1790
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:59,500
You went to Xiaoerkeng to play Qiqisan and climbed up

1791
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,100
this is the trail

1792
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,400
You can see these little pits along the trail

1793
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,900
Then it actually becomes a series of cracks

1794
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,700
How did these cracks come about?

1795
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,900
In fact, I know how some place names come from.

1796
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,600
Actually this is every

1797
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,500
It was just the result of the explosion that looked like Chongtian helping him

1798
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:21,200
I mean this small pit

1799
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,100
Of course not with time

1800
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,900
In turn it is a gas explosion from within

1801
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,500
It's when there's a lot of pressure underneath

1802
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,900
It instantly exploded like a hole

1803
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,100
So it's just a hole along this fault line

1804
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,900
hole by hole

1805
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,600
geological age has been

1806
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,200
explode again

1807
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,600
That's how it stays on the surface

1808
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,400
So if you examine this entire fracture hole

1809
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,800
These are all one by one

1810
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,100
It seems that this is connected with those in Shikeng

1811
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,300
very very many

1812
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,800
The rep says it's actually been active

1813
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,000
It's just that we haven't paid attention to it

1814
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,900
Generally speaking, we say that volcanic eruptions are magma.

1815
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Like this steam explosion just looks like that explosion sound that's it

1816
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Then this kind is like Hawaii, or many of them are hot sun to the surface with lava and broken rust flow

1817
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
What about this one? It's like Kaohsiung gas explosion

1818
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
It explodes, only the power of this door's cauldron explodes

1819
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Then don't say it doesn't seem threatening.

1820
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
January 3, 2014 he was a steam explosion

1821
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
He also caused the deaths of more than 60 people

1822
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
That death is really unfortunate

1823
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:42,000
this is autumn, then noon, then it's saturday

1824
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Because this January 3rd is like our Central Mountain Range, there are usually no people living nearby

1825
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
But the autumn wind is also super beautiful, a bunch of people went hiking on Saturday

1826
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Then when they run to the top of the mountain, their habit is to go to the top of the mountain

1827
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
You have to go to the top of the mountain before noon, and come down after eating some steam or bento

1828
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,200
Everyone near noon is at 3

1829
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,940
As a result, the explosion at that time

1830
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,240
That's why sixty or seventy

1831
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,700
if he is monday

1832
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,840
or 3 p.m.

1833
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,640
a cat is fine

1834
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,640
this is such an unfortunate thing

1835
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,800
just listen to this

1836
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,640
This is two when we count

1837
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,640
You said it sounded like a bird chirping

1838
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,240
like the people of the forest

1839
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:28,040
this one is slightly longer

1840
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,780
about two minutes

1841
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:34,480
In fact, I have collected a lot of these

1842
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,840
no i can't come in

1843
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,880
This is like a train

1844
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:46,680
played the sound of a train

1845
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:51,680
This image is staring at me

1846
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,080
that's good

1847
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,020
Then this giant viewer just now actually

1848
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,500
From now on I will write another article

1849
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,500
Just talking about this is a volcano conversation.

1850
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,500
In fact, it is one by one

1851
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,020
This Jet Arch Happened Another is this one

1852
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,020
So A and B are over there

1853
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:18,020
It's super fun to sing along

1854
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,020
It's the dialogue of the volcano

1855
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,520
Then this is Zhongshan Luo and Ziping after spraying

1856
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,520
Then it's like the two are talking

1857
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,520
The last one is

1858
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,520
Dean Guoyu

1859
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,520
This is a piece of Dean Guoyu

1860
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,520
I'll skip it first

1861
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,520
That's Dean Guoyu

1862
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,520
See me these volcano sounds

1863
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:51,520
He went to find that one called Art Association

1864
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,520
This is the performance art

1865
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,520
He said this voice can be used as background

1866
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,520
Then they played for two hours

1867
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,900
Then I listen to this wow this is wonderful

1868
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:07,400
This is the combination of science and humanities

1869
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,900
good last volcano heartbeat

1870
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,900
Then we have SeismicNet and we can record a lot of earthquakes

1871
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,400
That earthquake was nothing special

1872
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,200
But the funny thing is that we are here in Dayoukeng

1873
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,900
recorded hundreds of earthquakes

1874
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,200
So what's so special about this earthquake?

1875
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,700
This is the new electrogram

1876
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,300
Then every black line here is

1877
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,400
This one is an earthquake station

1878
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,900
Then every earthquake will have a

1879
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:36,300
just an earthquake

1880
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,500
So when an earthquake occurs

1881
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,800
Received all the brochures

1882
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,800
Then this bar and bar is an earthquake

1883
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,100
For example, just look at a single one.

1884
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,000
single brochure you see

1885
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,700
When each vertical bar

1886
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:51,800
just a small earthquake

1887
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,900
Then this small earthquake turned out to be periodic

1888
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:55,800
Hualian earthquake

1889
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,900
probably no one can understand

1890
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,900
when will the next earthquake occur

1891
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,000
but here i go with you

1892
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,760
Now there's another 18 minutes

1893
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,960
At 18 minutes, here are the statistics

1894
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,600
Of course not by a few seconds

1895
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,960
There will be one in 18 or 19 minutes

1896
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,000
This is about 1, 200 earthquakes

1897
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,840
every 18 minutes

1898
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,600
We know our heartbeat is 7, 80 beats per minute

1899
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:21,000
But you count about 18 minutes, 7, 80 times a day

1900
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,600
This means it dances very slowly

1901
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,800
But it is more interesting to say, when did this heartbeat start

1902
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,800
It is from a 4.8 earthquake in Hualien

1903
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,800
When the earthquake reached Yang Mingshan

1904
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,800
Then the heart starts beating

1905
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
it's not moby jump

1906
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
It is as if someone is going to wake it up, bite it

1907
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,800
It's time for a heartbeat

1908
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,800
Then I'll... this is another earthquake in Taichung

1909
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,800
3.7, as soon as the earthquake comes

1910
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,800
Bobo Bobo, the heartbeat is coming

1911
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,800
it happened three times

1912
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
Although it's only three times, I'm super excited

1913
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,800
How come... Earthquakes are periodic

1914
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,800
It's the whole world... I never mentioned it

1915
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
then i will make a metaphor

1916
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
This is the normal heartbeat

1917
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Then there's a heart problem

1918
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Start trimmer, start jumping wildly, don't jump at all

1919
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
then jump again

1920
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Then sent to the hospital, of course the electric shock

1921
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
He will jump up after the electric shock

1922
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
So the earthquake Taichung machine in Hualien

1923
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
like electric shock

1924
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
So Yangmingshan may be broken

1925
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
It's just that my heart hasn't jumped for a long time

1926
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
The earthquake shocked it and made him start jumping

1927
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That's a metaphor

1928
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
not really the case

1929
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
A fun thing is

1930
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
This heartbeat will kill

1931
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
The little mouse jumped hundreds of times

1932
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
his life is short

1933
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Elephants are good at jumping very slowly

1934
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
then live longer

1935
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Of course that person is no longer an animal?

1936
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
People are no longer in this ordinary animal

1937
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
This quote means

1938
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Anyway, the faster the heartbeat, the shorter the life

1939
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Well if this extends it to volcanoes

1940
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
those 18 minutes

1941
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,540
it's jumping super slow super slow

1942
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,540
So it can live for a long time

1943
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,160
I'm not scientific

1944
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:07,160
a bit silly

1945
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,840
ok then the last summary

1946
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,840
Let's go back to Daping Mountain

1947
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,840
with this

1948
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,680
This vulgar position may

1949
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:21,280
Metropolis and Old Town of Taipei

1950
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,120
This Taipei city is a million people

1951
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:26,360
Of course the Vulgar position

1952
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,560
Pompeii has 20,000 people

1953
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,680
This is much worse

1954
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,560
That's about 10 kilometers away.

1955
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,560
are very similar distances

1956
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,400
that is volcanic

1957
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,080
this big east volcano

1958
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,440
This date may be 6000 years

1959
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:43,840
But the Vulgarian position was actually sprayed again in 1914

1960
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,840
The heights of the Qixing Mountain and the Vulgar Seat are actually over 1,000.

1961
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,040
That's mainly interesting

1962
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,320
The area of ​​our magma household is about 70 square kilometers

1963
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,760
Ordinary position about 400

1964
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,280
In fact, it is 6 or 7 times larger

1965
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,320
6 times is actually bigger

1966
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,600
Volcano is getting bigger

1967
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,200
It's shallower too

1968
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,920
So we go a little deeper

1969
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,720
but we are trying now

1970
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,840
Find another 5 kilometers and 10 kilometers of magma chambers

1971
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,920
This is what we have been doing for the last few years

1972
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,080
Historical disasters, of course, this side is also very scary

1973
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,200
But Yangmingshan did not

1974
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,760
The last one is what we want to convey today

1975
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,720
Whether it's a big volcano or a small volcano

1976
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,640
Population nearby or far away

1977
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,200
In fact, in the past, science can tell us

1978
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:34,600
You just have to do something very easy to monitor

1979
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:37,800
There is probably a considerable degree of protection

1980
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,400
That monitoring is scientifically speaking

1981
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,800
that is very simple

1982
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:45,120
You just put the ruins down for some analysis and sorting.

1983
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:46,960
and then probably give us some

1984
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,680
good reference relic

1985
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,360
The ancient city of Navisbowei is here

1986
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,680
But Napoli so they keep doing it

1987
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,920
This is a volcanic city

1988
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,040
cities on or around volcanoes

1989
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,240
That Taipei is also a volcano

1990
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,500
one of the volcano cities

1991
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:05,000
The question is, will the volcano move?

1992
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,200
we do not know

1993
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,300
but we have to be prepared

1994
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:09,900
if one day it moves

1995
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,500
we need to know in advance

1996
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,900
That's the job of going to the Volcano Watch to fight

1997
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:16,900
So a simple question

1998
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:20,000
I am often asked by many people

1999
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
So maybe now you guys can answer

2000
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,100
Will the first one be active

2001
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:26,900
Yes

2002
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,600
I usually don't even think about it

2003
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,100
i usually want to say

2004
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:32,100
can not rule out

2005
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,600
more like this

2006
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,900
Then the second is to say

2007
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,600
Spending money will be interesting

2008
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,200
yes

2009
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,600
everyone trust me

2010
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,300
I often go around giving speeches to people

2011
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,100
that's it

2012
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:46,600
But actually I'm pretty stressed when I go home

2013
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,300
the day the volcano erupts

2014
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,200
I still haven't told everyone

2015
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,800
I might

2016
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,400
Might have to kill myself like this

2017
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,600
And where did the millions of citizens flee to?

2018
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,100
This is the section chief of the exercise in Taipei

2019
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,500
You keep checking on me, just asking what to do? What should Mr. Lin do?

2020
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:08,000
He said where are our six million people going? I said don't scare yourself

2021
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
There is no such thing as six million people, right?

2022
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,500
Then Qiandu also wanted to say that we should move to Taichung.

2023
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:19,500
The last question has an answer

2024
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:23,500
We should not be in the ancient city next to us

2025
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,500
Except for many natural conditions, the most important and the least

2026
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:31,500
Reality and space are different, there was no science two thousand years ago

2027
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,000
people don't know what's going on

2028
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
but we now have science

2029
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,500
Science can tell us many answers

2030
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:42,000
So the simple answer is no

2031
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So it's festival

2032
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,500
It means that we will live and die with the volcano.

2033
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,000
but through science

2034
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Finally, I would like to thank the relevant units

2035
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,500
Because this plan has actually been in the works for more than ten years.

2036
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,000
It's this big plan that has been in the works for more than ten years.

2037
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
not a single one

2038
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,440
This department or Chinese can also pay for all this

2039
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:09,440
So we use various channels

2040
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:13,120
Then go to persuade people to give money to people

2041
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,720
So let's build this bounce off the battle

2042
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:20,120
Okay, sorry for the delay.

2043
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:21,120
thanks, thanks

2044
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:30,520
Well we thank you researcher for a very good presentation

2045
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:34,040
Now the rest of our time is open to questions

2046
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:40,320
We have prepared exquisite gifts on site

2047
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,840
hand over here

2048
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,560
We have ten, so the first ten

2049
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,640
If the first ten people ask questions, they will get a small gift

2050
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:53,800
There's that microphone in front of you guys

2051
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,840
wait a minute please use the microphone if you want to ask a question

2052
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,000
click that one

2053
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,400
green part

2054
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,240
This will turn the microphone on

2055
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:03,540
good

2056
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,600
now please

2057
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,040
what's your problem

2058
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,400
good

2059
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,040
here

2060
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,040
Hello Mr. Lin

2061
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:10,800
good

2062
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,040
Actually what I want to ask is

2063
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,140
if a warning occurs say

2064
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,740
There will be a big earthquake in the next ten days

2065
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:17,040
there will be a volcanic eruption

2066
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,080
no results

2067
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,680
seems more serious

2068
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,540
like a typhoon

2069
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,580
put a fake result

2070
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,780
No, my question is actually

2071
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:26,240
The characteristics of the Big Butt Volcano and other

2072
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:26,900
other volcanoes

2073
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,280
For example, the volcanic nature of Hawaii

2074
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,380
Is there any difference

2075
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:31,020
In other words, just ten days ago

2076
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:33,180
That dense vibration thing

2077
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,260
Big Butt Volcano

2078
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:35,580
we have no way to prove

2079
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,180
really like that

2080
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,860
Will time really explode in the future?

2081
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:39,180
unless it really explodes

2082
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,560
That experience comes from

2083
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,780
Hawaiian Volcanoes

2084
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,280
Will they be the same

2085
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,280
still may be different

2086
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:44,780
Thanks

2087
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,360
this is a very good question

2088
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,080
and you're an insider

2089
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,420
the volcanic issue

2090
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,820
Actually not 100%

2091
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:55,460
And every volcano behaves differently

2092
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,120
In fact, the Hawaiian volcano and Mount Fuji

2093
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,120
Or that actually the volcano has very

2094
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
many kinds

2095
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,500
Shrimp meat is also relatively viscous magma

2096
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,500
so it just won't explode

2097
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,000
This one was blasted

2098
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
It actually flows more like water

2099
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,500
That's like this volcano in the Pacific Rim

2100
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,000
it will explode like

2101
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,500
That's because of its viscosity

2102
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,500
Or we say its acid-base scientifically

2103
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,000
Its ratio of that SIO2

2104
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,500
you can imagine that

2105
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,500
as a pot of water

2106
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,000
Shrimp meat is like a pot of water

2107
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
when you add it

2108
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
the water will roll

2109
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,500
But if you cook a pot of porridge

2110
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,000
or corn chowder with words

2111
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
When the viscosity is high

2112
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,500
you boil boil boil it will

2113
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,000
it will

2114
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
right

2115
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
it's sticky

2116
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,500
it accumulates energy all the time

2117
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:42,500
then it's about to explode

2118
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:44,000
so different volcanoes

2119
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
In fact, its composition is different

2120
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,500
it behaves differently

2121
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,000
So we can't put shrimp flavor

2122
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
or usually by fire

2123
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,500
Any volcanic act takes

2124
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:54,500
Predicting what will happen to our big volcanoes

2125
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,500
In fact, to put it bluntly, everyone

2126
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:57,500
or everyone volcano

2127
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,500
has its own unique personality

2128
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
We want to predict the behavior of a person

2129
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We can't put A's person's

2130
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
past to predict B's

2131
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
In fact, the risk is great

2132
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
We better do it for A

2133
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
good observation

2134
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
See how his behavior tends to be

2135
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Then we make predictions based on the strategy

2136
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
But even then we can't

2137
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
In fact, there are several volcanoes that say

2138
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I thought it would erupt, but it didn't

2139
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
this is

2140
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Sometimes for a very simple reason

2141
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Your magma keeps moving up and down

2142
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Successors are unreasonable. In fact, Mount Fuji used to be

2143
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
this 2001

2144
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Japanese scientists and the government

2145
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
is nervous as hell

2146
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Why do they earthquake from 20 km

2147
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
I have been running and running for 2 kilometers

2148
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
He thought it might come up tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

2149
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
be quiet from now on

2150
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So it's still his

2151
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
this uncertainty

2152
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
We can only do it by looking at the skills

2153
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
yes

2154
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
yes

2155
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,600
It is the shadow of the S wave and the phantom of the P wave that you mentioned earlier

2156
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,200
These are the two phenomena of smoke and phantom arrival

2157
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:12,200
Then these two phenomena are what I just said from the teacher.

2158
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:16,600
I think all I know is that it reflects that it is a representative book

2159
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,400
There is a liquid substance in the ground

2160
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:22,400
How can we infer from the existence of this liquid substance?

2161
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:27,800
It is possible to estimate the volume of the magma chamber and its depth

2162
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,800
Is this information? Thanks

2163
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,800
The volume is based on the presence or absence of side stations on our surface

2164
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,400
We can roughly outline a range

2165
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,000
that depth is a good question

2166
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Depth because of more scientific issues

2167
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,800
That is to say, I didn't talk much here.

2168
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:48,600
That is to say, I use earthquakes at different depths for cross-comparison

2169
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:52,000
There is a little bit of this depth past and this depth

2170
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,600
If cut to yes or no

2171
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,200
It has an angle, right?

2172
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,800
If at the very surface it doesn't have both

2173
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,800
because it is kilometers

2174
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,300
start to have a little gap

2175
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,600
So take it slow

2176
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,440
Of course this is just an estimate

2177
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,640
That's why we have our second big plan.

2178
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,640
Hope to make more accurate

2179
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,840
So something like this

2180
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,340
At present, the preliminary results can only reach this

2181
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,340
yes

2182
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,040
because probably the whole world

2183
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,440
I think I'm the first to do this

2184
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,040
Because like Mount Fuji

2185
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,140
Actually theirs or Hasber Mountain

2186
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:35,680
they are very clear

2187
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,540
What's in store along the river

2188
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,680
the evidence is very clear

2189
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:40,640
people don't need to do this

2190
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,540
That's because it's too controversial in Taiwan

2191
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:44,540
We can't see that thing on the surface

2192
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:47,040
That's why I worked so hard to come up with this way.

2193
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,400
to verify

2194
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:49,480
so this is

2195
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,840
should be the only

2196
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,700
I know so far

2197
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,200
The only person in science who does this

2198
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,200
yes

2199
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,260
Hello Mr. Lin

2200
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:05,540
I want to ask is in the past geological records

2201
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:13,800
Is there any record of volcanic debris in the Datong volcanic group like Unzen Volcano?

2202
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,160
In the history of our mankind, there is no

2203
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,300
But in geology

2204
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,360
If there is information, I can show you that debris road.

2205
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,360
what's that called

2206
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,760
The kind with debris in several places

2207
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,060
that kind of road

2208
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:33,460
We haven't decided on the land and year yet.

2209
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:37,260
We are now just like six thousand years is just a year of volcanic ash

2210
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:42,420
The land on the other side of the debris has not yet been overcome

2211
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:46,380
But at least there's evidence out there

2212
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:48,520
is visible from the surface

2213
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,220
yes

2214
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:56,080
So it is not sure whether it is possible to be as serious as Japan's self-disaster

2215
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,380
Are you sure you know there is such a record?

2216
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:00,400
have this record

2217
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
But our human history is

2218
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
In Taiwan only

2219
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
No more than 1000 years or so without these records

2220
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
ok thank you teacher

2221
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Hello teacher

2222
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Chase Volcanic Group

2223
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Because it is quite old

2224
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
More than 28 million to 200,000

2225
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Recently, it was just about 50 million

2226
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
5000 years

2227
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
So a magma in this place

2228
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Distribution of double libraries

2229
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Historically

2230
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Should it be concentrated

2231
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
because when it's about to spray flowers

2232
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
There must be cracks sucked out

2233
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
right

2234
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
at Big Butt Volcano in this

2235
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
triangle fault this period

2236
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
There may also be cracks and suction that will spray out

2237
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
But the volume of the magma chamber

2238
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Correspondingly, it must also be sucked with crack

2239
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
have a match

2240
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
So when it comes to spraying flowers

2241
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Is there one of these two

2242
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
there is a proof

2243
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Yes, many academic circles or our experts probably think that it means

2244
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
The current triangular fault

2245
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
In fact, it is a bad department

2246
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
The magma is likely to be on this inferior system

2247
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
this climb up

2248
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
It is along this line of development

2249
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
the future is actually

2250
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
We can't be sure

2251
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
But the possibility is possible

2252
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:33,000
So this goes up this direction of the triangle fault

2253
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Is Qiqisan right next to the fault at the foot of the mountain?

2254
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
The big oil pit is not far away

2255
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Then we saw the verification activity

2256
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
That is, the seismic activity is all on the side of the Seven Seventh Three Oil Pit.

2257
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
It seems to match the geometry of the triangle fault.

2258
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Therefore, it is very likely that the inferior system along the fault zone of the Triangular Fault

2259
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
lava will come up

2260
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
This is guesswork

2261
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Another inference is that

2262
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Because the triangular fault is a kind of fault before the earthquake

2263
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
only then will there be contact

2264
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
years to now

2265
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
200,000 years to the last 50 million years

2266
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Because this time comes in the crust

2267
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
in terms of address

2268
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
is it going to stabilize

2269
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
or there will be signs of activity

2270
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Is there any research on this

2271
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:24,000
There is a comparison problem with the magma chamber

2272
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Because if the magma chamber is on the other side

2273
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
over here over here

2274
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It is also impossible to have the problem of spraying flowers

2275
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
This is actually a good question

2276
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
because of how we do research now

2277
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
to citizen is now

2278
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
you have to compare with the past

2279
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
to know that it is regional stability

2280
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
still unstable

2281
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
But past evidence actually

2282
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
super blurry

2283
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
So we just can't compare

2284
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
so many people say

2285
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Magma is in the process of cooling

2286
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Then of course nothing will happen in the future

2287
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
still not cooling

2288
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Evidence

2289
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,400
good evidence to control his activities now is up and down

2290
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,400
yes yes yes of course

2291
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,400
Yes Yes Yes

2292
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,100
Yes Yes Yes

2293
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:29,400
Yes Yes Yes

2294
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Yes Yes Yes

2295
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Yes Yes Yes

2296
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
There is still a lot of work to do after all this

2297
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Thanks

2298
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Hello Professor Lin

2299
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
two questions

2300
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
The first one is like our landslides

2301
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
When we all have to issue alerts

2302
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Just say how much rainfall exceeds the yellow alert

2303
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Or the amount of rainfall exceeds the red alert

2304
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I don't know if our TVO has any data now

2305
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
when the earthquake exceeds how much

2306
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
or how much the ground temperature exceeds

2307
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,500
or when the concentration of carbon dioxide reaches

2308
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,800
we're going to publish the next

2309
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,000
we live right under the volcanic triangle

2310
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,400
we care about this stack

2311
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:08,800
Then the second question is

2312
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,100
small oil pit it

2313
01:33:10,100 --> 01:33:13,300
We now call it a blowout word

2314
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,200
that it didn't stand to burst

2315
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,200
we call it a blowout port better

2316
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:21,400
It would be more appropriate to call it the landslide

2317
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,900
Now the second question should be the blowout

2318
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,500
because of the collapse

2319
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:28,000
Collapsed

2320
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,600
because most think it's a burst

2321
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,700
a rupture in a fault zone

2322
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:37,100
That collapse behavior is not like that

2323
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,700
collapse is just a sag

2324
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:42,800
but it is a concave whole

2325
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,100
like a pit

2326
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,000
So it's not the same as collapsing

2327
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
it's a blast

2328
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,700
and we have a lot of steam

2329
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,300
what is this jet

2330
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,800
the first question is

2331
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:56,800
next to

2332
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,900
this is very difficult

2333
01:33:58,900 --> 01:33:59,800
but

2334
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
One NCDR is the center of the international battlefield

2335
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Or the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of the Interior

2336
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Forced me to talk about this every day

2337
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,000
But I'm here to be honest

2338
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Actually, I know very little

2339
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
But the people or the government need a standard

2340
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
So we're forced to set a standard

2341
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
we try very

2342
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
because there is no history

2343
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,000
no background

2344
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,000
so we don't know

2345
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
How big is this volcano

2346
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Only then will the dam collapse

2347
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
if it has previous records

2348
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
we can probably use it as a reference

2349
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But we don't have this record

2350
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
So we can only put

2351
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
compulsively put other volcanic

2352
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Many volcanoes in Japan are used as a reference

2353
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But I must say that this reference is actually

2354
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
really just for reference

2355
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
cannot

2356
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Much of this is still unknown

2357
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
difficult things

2358
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Because many people are in this civil government

2359
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Most have been asking about this

2360
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
This is with effort

2361
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
ok lady

2362
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Teacher Lin, I want to ask you

2363
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Because I often take Chinese and foreign tourists to small tourists

2364
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I remember about half a year ago

2365
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
There was a magnitude 5.5 earthquake this year

2366
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
very close to taipei

2367
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
After a few days, I will take tourists to Xiaoyoukeng

2368
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I just realized I haven't gone yet

2369
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
as soon as i got out of the parking lot i heard

2370
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Loud sound like pit shooting an airplane

2371
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
i never heard

2372
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
then you're the first to hear

2373
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I always

2374
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
the airport is very big

2375
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Because I often take Chinese and foreign tourists to that scenic spot

2376
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I've never heard of such a big

2377
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,000
As big as a crater plane right next to your ear

2378
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I was thinking then

2379
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
My video should start leading everyone away

2380
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
escape with everyone

2381
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
But two months later

2382
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,000
when i go

2383
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
that voice is gone

2384
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Then you often monitor over there

2385
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
i don't know

2386
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
This is a very common phenomenon

2387
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
it's just that loud

2388
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
The sound of your jet is different from the ones I usually go to

2389
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
The other one is that the information I read is that

2390
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Two judgments whether it is a volcano

2391
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
one that you just listed

2392
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
What I've read always says 200,000 years

2393
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
The first condition is 200,000 years

2394
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
The second condition is whether there is a magma chamber

2395
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Then I know that we now know that there are magma chambers.

2396
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Said that we used to define it as repairing volcanoes or even stone volcanoes

2397
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Then I also read about Guishan Island

2398
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
The last eruption appears to have been 200,000 years ago

2399
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
four times

2400
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Then I want to know the dating method that says I am more correct

2401
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,000
i should say

2402
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
which one should be used

2403
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
which was the last eruption

2404
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Because I obviously 200,000 is not the same

2405
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:46,000
200,000 is not

2406
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
ten thousand years

2407
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
10,000 years is actually related to the Central Geological Survey

2408
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
active fault

2409
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
That is, the most active active fault is 10,000 years old.

2410
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
So ten thousand years is them

2411
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
In the geological world, they are equivalent to having a

2412
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
as long as it is a living geology

2413
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Regardless of volcanic faults, all are references

2414
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Two hundred thousand is too long

2415
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
The two hundred thousand...

2416
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And you just heard that I really hope

2417
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
if you can take your time

2418
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
probably tell me

2419
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Because we now have a 24 hour record

2420
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Then if you probably have the truth

2421
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
how often do you say

2422
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
In my impression, I watched it carefully for half a year

2423
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
i spent a lot of time

2424
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
20 hour inspection

2425
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
About 10 days on average

2426
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
two weeks

2427
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Anyway, about 10 days or so

2428
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I can probably argue

2429
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
There is the sound of this so-called place name

2430
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
But sometimes very often

2431
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Sometimes it's 3 days

2432
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
always have

2433
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
that sometimes happens sporadically

2434
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Just once or twice a week

2435
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Dirty, right?

2436
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
so if you can really hear

2437
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Because I often ask people

2438
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Because of my information, I saw that it really exists.

2439
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
but i didn't really hear anyone

2440
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
So you probably have this very precious

2441
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
is that I believe he usually looks like

2442
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
just pissed off

2443
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
But occasionally found that there will be something like

2444
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
like firecrackers

2445
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
loud this

2446
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
popping sound

2447
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Otherwise, you will not receive my earthquake

2448
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
yes yes that should be

2449
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
because what you describe is

2450
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
it is relatively low frequency

2451
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
a little longer

2452
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
right right right right

2453
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
wow this is real

2454
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
yes

2455
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
yes

2456
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
if the volcano

2457
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
fire volcano it can come in fire volcano

2458
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
can there be a way

2459
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
can it be made into a stone volcano

2460
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
right

2461
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
because it's on a volcano

2462
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
while it's working

2463
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
we invest something in

2464
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yes or no

2465
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
then to destroy it

2466
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
volcanic stuff

2467
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:05,900
This, this, this is a bit difficult

2468
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:09,400
This is like an earthquake. Some people say that the energy of Zhentan is lost.

2469
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,600
So this fault

2470
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:13,200
He just wanted to say we just let it make a small earthquake

2471
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,900
A big earthquake turns into many small earthquakes

2472
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:16,400
we water it

2473
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,600
This is a scientific quake

2474
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,600
Fault you pump water into it

2475
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:21,000
it will start to slip

2476
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,200
release energy

2477
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,900
But this is very risky

2478
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:26,200
no one dares to do this why

2479
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,400
How to do it?

2480
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,200
Yes, yes, it is fine normally

2481
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,000
you add water to it

2482
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,600
That's it, a big earthquake, who is responsible

2483
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:36,800
This is actually

2484
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:40,600
You can't control whether it will increase or decrease

2485
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,300
The same problem is that the volcano

2486
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,100
the natural world i think we

2487
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:46,200
probably difficult

2488
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,600
With current technology it is possible

2489
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,500
is it possible

2490
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,400
how to do this

2491
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,600
if i stand over there

2492
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,000
how could he want to go

2493
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
He works or stands there

2494
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,700
Because the magma chamber is over there.

2495
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,700
Yes Yes Yes

2496
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,500
it would have been a big thing

2497
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:04,700
We can slowly reduce it

2498
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:06,300
replace it with this

2499
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:08,500
If the line is like this, that's right.

2500
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,000
It should be possible

2501
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,500
But now I don't know what to do

2502
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:14,000
yes

2503
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,500
Okay, Professor Lin, ask for advice.

2504
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,700
That is to say you just mentioned

2505
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:23,500
Huangchi Park is a huge volcano

2506
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:26,000
so-called extra-large or medium-sized

2507
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
or how a small volcano is defined

2508
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,500
So how dangerous is it?

2509
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,500
Probably we can now easily define

2510
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:34,500
just look at it

2511
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:38,000
Like this volume of the magma house

2512
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,500
It seems like the one in Huangchi Park

2513
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:44,500
Seems like thousands of cubic kilometers

2514
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:48,000
A few thousand, I don't know if fifteen thousand or how much

2515
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
That's just like ours

2516
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
The big round volcano may only be

2517
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Only a hundred

2518
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
About 100 programs

2519
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Of course it's the magma house

2520
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
The bigger the magma chamber, it only needs to be squeezed out a little bit, which is actually quite impressive

2521
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,000
If the magma chamber is small, of course it is less dangerous

2522
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
So volcanoes are graded

2523
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,000
According to the magma, it is divided into 12345 levels

2524
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
graded

2525
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Just now I saw a few after the volcanic eruption

2526
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
There is an example of escaping

2527
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Then I want to ask that after the volcano ceases to be active

2528
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
How soon can they go back and live there

2529
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
wow this is another problem

2530
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:44,000
In fact, it is relatively easy for people to evacuate from the volcano

2531
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And after the evacuation, when will they be allowed to go back

2532
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
People in general always want to go back

2533
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Looks like as long as it doesn't smoke, he wants to go back

2534
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
But the role unit, the government is actually very difficult

2535
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Because what I just talked about is when the magma goes up

2536
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
We can easily see those

2537
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,200
But he stringed to a certain word

2538
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,800
Then it started when there was no change

2539
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,000
When will it suddenly come together again?

2540
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
that the evidence starts to get murky.

2541
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
even say when it will start to be quiet

2542
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
This is not a good reference standard

2543
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Sometimes it is one of the decision-making units

2544
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
it's just a decision

2545
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:30,000
So going back is actually a big trouble

2546
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
when can we go back

2547
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
like hawaii, right?

2548
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
move at midnight

2549
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
then it seems to stop

2550
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
recently again

2551
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
like that paris island

2552
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Last October was like two months of activity

2553
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Then it stops in the middle

2554
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That July the last July

2555
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Paris Island is back in action

2556
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
So when he first moved

2557
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
That kind of estimation is actually more difficult.

2558
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
But from being quiet to moving

2559
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
It's actually easier

2560
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
from hole to silence

2561
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
that is

2562
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
not so easy

2563
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
so still

2564
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
want a lot

2565
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
lady behind

2566
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
i want to ask

2567
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
That researcher Lin is

2568
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Because I told you a long time ago

2569
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Earthquakes can be predicted with animals

2570
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
like a fish or a snake or something

2571
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
But have you ever thought about using animals to

2572
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
conduct

2573
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
i don't know maybe you're not very practical either

2574
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
but maybe there is a way

2575
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Have you ever been through this period?

2576
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
still have you thought about it

2577
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
this is not bad

2578
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Why do we use animals for earthquakes

2579
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
in what strange way

2580
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Because the science of earthquake prediction

2581
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
upper level of science

2582
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Everyone thinks it's not feasible

2583
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
so everyone is

2584
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
If you go to Western medicine

2585
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
I found out that you are terminally ill and cannot be cured.

2586
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Then everyone is looking for a way

2587
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,700
But in terms of volcanoes

2588
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,700
He talks to you about the science chapter

2589
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:08,200
There is a lot of evidence that volcanoes cost money to erupt

2590
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,500
Why should I look for a remedy?

2591
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,000
So in terms of volcanoes

2592
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,400
You do these monitoring for formal evidence

2593
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,300
probably the answer

2594
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:18,600
But the earthquake is still touching

2595
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:22,100
So the idea of ​​thousands or hundreds of dollars will come out

2596
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:23,600
Thanks

2597
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:31,000
I want to confirm one thing with your professor

2598
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:36,100
A few months ago in Beitou there was an earthquake at more than four o'clock

2599
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:38,200
Exactly the same result when I saw

2600
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:40,300
It seems to be near Zhongshan Building

2601
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:43,100
It's very close to the Tatun Volcanic Group

2602
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:48,600
Later, the Meteorological Bureau said that it was due to the movement of the plate.

2603
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,900
but i doubt it

2604
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:55,000
so according to your opinion

2605
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:00,100
The earthquake caused by the same thing

2606
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,880
Is it really a plate movement?

2607
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,880
It is also a post-increase of the volcanic group

2608
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:07,720
if i remember correctly

2609
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:08,960
you may be asking to have a

2610
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,120
They called it the Beitou Earthquake at first

2611
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:11,400
right

2612
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:12,680
This scale is 5.7

2613
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:13,560
because for many years

2614
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:17,400
There is no earthquake that happened in the center of Taipei City

2615
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:18,840
The earthquake was actually

2616
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,160
The weather should be right.

2617
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:22,040
The reason is that the earthquake was deep

2618
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,640
more than 100 kilometers

2619
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,080
So that is related to our Philippine Sea plate

2620
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,240
go north in silence

2621
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,400
Earthquakes in this hidden belt

2622
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:32,960
It's not in this 10km of the volcano

2623
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,720
this shallow surface

2624
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,520
If it is within 5 km 10 km

2625
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:38,400
That's more to do with volcanoes

2626
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,920
but is it 140 or what

2627
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:41,800
140 kilometers

2628
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:42,520
that's deep

2629
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:44,080
It is related to the plate

2630
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,040
So the Meteorological Bureau's interpretation is

2631
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:49,600
basically ok

2632
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,080
It is scientifically accepted

2633
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,360
right

2634
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:56,880
sir behind

2635
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,720
Hello Mr. Lin

2636
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
What We Know About the Threat of Volcanoes in Northern Taiwan

2637
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
In addition to the big hip volcano

2638
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
haiti volcano in geelung it is also a volcano of fire

2639
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
And it may have been active in Keelung Sea School in 1867

2640
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Will we address such disaster risks in the future?

2641
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
will do some scientific research

2642
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Thanks

2643
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Yes, I'm personally very interested

2644
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
You are actually many, many professional

2645
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Because there is a seabed and a volcano directly below Keelung Port.

2646
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
submarine volcano

2647
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
And they went to explore the ocean

2648
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
That volcanic sea will be very steamy

2649
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It means it's a volcano

2650
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
The teacher Xi Jinping from CUHK and the teacher from Yangshan National Taiwan University

2651
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
they just do some research

2652
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Then I also believe

2653
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I personally believe this to be proven

2654
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
It was the sea school in 1867

2655
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It is probably because it was said in the early days that the sea school caused by the earthquake

2656
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
But the volcanic, submarine volcanic activity caused the sea school

2657
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,600
In fact, the possibility is quite high

2658
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,100
but need evidence

2659
01:47:03,100 --> 01:47:04,500
that we need to investigate

2660
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:07,700
So the future government will also do this

2661
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:11,000
I personally will be very involved in doing it

2662
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
It's just that the investigation and research in the sea is more difficult

2663
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,800
So we need more of these technologies

2664
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,000
or some way to overcome

2665
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,500
but that's worth doing

2666
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,000
yes

2667
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,100
Literary performance

2668
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,000
Hello teacher

2669
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,400
two questions

2670
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,100
The first question is about the prediction of volcanic eruptions

2671
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,100
It's what you just mentioned

2672
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:35,100
If you try to predict a volcanic eruption

2673
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:37,900
We can see that it was before the earthquake

2674
01:47:37,900 --> 01:47:40,600
It is possible to slowly change forward from a relatively deep place

2675
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,200
Then but what I want to ask is

2676
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:45,300
The speed at which the magma is extruded from the ground

2677
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:46,900
how fast it can

2678
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:50,200
Like if a whole bunch of omens happened within two hours today

2679
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,500
Like some hot spring water getting hot

2680
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,900
or place names

2681
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,300
just too helpless

2682
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:59,300
could it be in two hours

2683
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,000
maybe or a

2684
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,760
Within this hour, all earthquake-prone people will be

2685
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:08,560
Then the water temperature of the hot springs and the like

2686
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:12,080
Is it possible to have such a fast speed

2687
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:12,920
This is the first question

2688
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:13,960
Excuse me

2689
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,400
And then the second question is about the crater lake

2690
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,520
It's what I read in a magazine

2691
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,240
There are three three crater lakes in Africa

2692
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:26,120
Then what used to happen was

2693
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,760
It's the volcano under the crater lake.

2694
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:29,880
gas eruption

2695
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:33,480
which then creates carbon dioxide in the lake

2696
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,240
concentration saturation etc.

2697
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:38,280
And then this carbon dioxide floats out of this lake

2698
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:42,840
and killed an entire village in one night

2699
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,000
Then what I want to ask is

2700
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,960
Is it possible for this to happen in Taiwan?

2701
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,280
because we just heard

2702
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,320
That is, Taiwan has Haitian volcanoes.

2703
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,240
There are many hot springs

2704
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:52,720
I have no idea

2705
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:55,320
Is it because Taiwan has this condition that this kind of thing will happen?

2706
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:55,960
that's it thank you

2707
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:56,560
Yes Yes

2708
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:57,520
The first question is to say

2709
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,760
because one hour two hours

2710
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,960
Suddenly the volcano erupts

2711
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,400
basically it should be hard

2712
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:08,500
Because the magma is actually very viscous when it moves.

2713
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:14,700
It will not run from 5km to 10km to the surface like a bomb

2714
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,200
can't be that fast

2715
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:20,400
Usually weeks or months

2716
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,200
even for several years

2717
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,000
it's running slowly

2718
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,500
So within a short period of time, probably within a day

2719
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:29,400
It should be from the school ceremony, but there is no

2720
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,900
about crater lake

2721
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,200
In fact, because it is full of your volcano

2722
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:37,900
there is a crater

2723
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:40,700
like a lake

2724
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:44,900
Then it will rain and a lot of water will accumulate

2725
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:49,400
That volcanic gas is actually a lot of acid

2726
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,900
And CO2 is the most

2727
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:53,400
There is also a lot of acid

2728
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,300
So these can easily become sour

2729
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:56,700
Carbonic acid, fluidic acid, etc.

2730
01:49:56,700 --> 01:50:00,200
Of course, the same is true for plant organisms or animals.

2731
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,120
quite a big impact

2732
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,400
so you just have to be in crater lake

2733
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,920
if there is volcanic activity

2734
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,960
In fact, the water will become very acidic.

2735
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:09,760
will affect

2736
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,320
But under the sea

2737
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,600
This problem may be less

2738
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:15,760
Because the sea is water after all, it is big

2739
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,680
so it gets diluted

2740
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:21,400
But the lake has very little water

2741
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,960
So it will be relatively high concentration

2742
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:24,760
will be more harmful

2743
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:28,720
The sea is probably unless it happens to be in a submarine crater

2744
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,520
Creatures there may be affected

2745
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,120
But it's easy to dilute

2746
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,120
yes

2747
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,920
There's another one here

2748
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:42,040
Hello teacher

2749
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,000
What about Chase Volcano?

2750
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,040
Our date according to the Volcano Society is

2751
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,040
The last climb was within a few thousand years

2752
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:49,760
then ask the teacher

2753
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,080
The date of the volcanic meeting is

2754
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,880
probably what kind of method

2755
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,640
may the teacher explain

2756
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:57,520
volcano will it actually be

2757
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,280
Simple, they all use a lot

2758
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,400
carbon fourteen its some half-life

2759
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,400
So many address circles use half-life

2760
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:11,400
then it is a decay how many years it takes

2761
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,800
Then see that the ratio has decayed several times

2762
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,000
then how many years

2763
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,400
It's probably like this for many years

2764
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,600
Just use the half-life of the earth year

2765
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:21,800
The half-life of course

2766
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:25,200
Carbon fourteen is often used for thousands of years to ten thousand years

2767
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:27,400
But if it's hundreds of thousands of years or millions

2768
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:29,600
It has additionally this radiological accreditation

2769
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,200
That can already be made dumb or dumb or something like that

2770
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:36,200
So they have professionals who are doing this

2771
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:37,200
Yes Yes Yes

2772
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,600
Is it okay, here is the last one

2773
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:44,800
last question

2774
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,800
yes

2775
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:48,000
I just want to ask

2776
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,400
Can the volcanic crushed crab flow predict the direction?

2777
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:55,800
Because at that time Pompeii would be

2778
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,000
will be submerged by the volcanic shardcrab flow

2779
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,800
That is, it goes in that direction

2780
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
In addition, there is another Napoleon director's place

2781
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
If it's distributed at the Datong event in Taipei

2782
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Can we just predict which direction it's going?

2783
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Then we can avoid that disaster

2784
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
yes the answer is yes

2785
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
It's as simple as water

2786
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
you pour the water down

2787
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
it goes to the lowest flow

2788
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
that's actually for this

2789
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
In fact, Japan, especially Japan, has done a lot of work

2790
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
It looks at the village for example

2791
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
That, that, that ancient underground is a village

2792
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
then what do they do

2793
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
That that water spilled into the sea and rushed to the village

2794
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
they do something like this

2795
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
gutter or retaining wall

2796
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
It's a bit like the concept of flood control

2797
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Just be a very, very resolute body

2798
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
When the water leaks and touches that body, it turns a corner.

2799
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
won't rush to the village

2800
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
So this is predictable

2801
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
predictable

2802
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Then make some preparations for evacuation

2803
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
So Japan has done a lot in this regard

2804
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Thanks

2805
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
i want to end

2806
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Let us know about our August

2807
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Feast of knowledge next month

2808
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
by Chen Zhicheng

2809
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
is the biomedical

2810
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Institute of Science

2811
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
What's the matter with soreness?

2812
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
So this is a life science subject

2813
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
talk about pain slowly

2814
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
molecular biology

2815
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
receptor molecule with acid

2816
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
that's there

2817
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
before we all get ready to leave

2818
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
let us once again warmly

2819
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Thank you for your wonderful speech today

2820
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Thank you all for coming

2821
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
thank you all

2822
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Related here, is any of the said related.

2823
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,000
