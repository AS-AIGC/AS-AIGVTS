1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Academia Sinica's September governor's feast lecture begins

3
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Director Wu Chongli of the Secretariat asked us to host

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Thank you all for coming to the governor's feast tonight

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Originally, it was because Vice President Huang wanted to come over.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But because he has other important matters at the moment, he can't come here

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So it's just me doing the scraping here

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then tonight's speech should be very exciting.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The speaker is Mr. Li Zhende from our 11th school.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And the theme is when history meets gender

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
this is teacher li

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Bouncing off the fragments of the sixth-century Bhikkhu Yuanni's tombstone in the Reread collection

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then I still think Mr. Li should be familiar to everyone in the history circle.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But for me, I think I should introduce Teacher Li a little bit more.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Teacher Li has a bachelor's degree in history from National Taiwan University and a master's degree in history from National Taiwan University.

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Went to the University of Washington in Seattle to obtain a Ph.D. in History

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now he is working as a researcher at our Institute of History and Research

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In fact, I interacted with Mr. Li in many meetings.

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He is a very gentle lady with a good personality and very knowledgeable questions.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So what she does is to explore from the perspective of gender

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
About the legal system between Hantang and medical care

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She has a lot of books and the explanations are very interesting.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's called the death of the princess. What you don't know about Chinese legal history

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,520
He also has another book that is also well known

25
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,000
is a woman's history of Chinese medicine

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,360
Health care and gender among Han tangs

27
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,720
In addition, he has also read many papers

28
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,360
and edited Gender Body and Medical

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,160
Academician Liang Qizhi

30
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,600
co-edited women and society and more

31
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,840
In recent years, he is also an Asia

32
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
Editor-in-Chief of the Major

33
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,000
Now Editor-in-Chief of New Historiography

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
Because of his personal history

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,400
So I'm often in many awards

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,120
I have seen Mr. Li's name

37
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,040
including the Distinguished Research Award from the National Science Council

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,080
This is a very important indicator in our science and technology department

39
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,040
In addition, it is also in the Distinguished Talent Lecture

40
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,920
It seems like two years ago three years ago

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,960
Funding is currently in progress

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,120
Apparently it is in the current Taiwan historian circle

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,320
very important person

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,520
Then I won't talk nonsense anymore

45
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,720
Then I will give the stick to Teacher Li

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mr. Li thank you

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
ladies and gentlemen

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
thank you so much everyone for tonight

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just after the Mid-Autumn Festival, I worked hard to come here

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Listening to the speech is really admirable

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
then i'm glad to be here today

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Share it with everyone

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
actually i think

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
able to receive this knowledge

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
miss is to feel very honored

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mainly every time I see

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
When this poster of Knowledge Missing came out

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I feel that each of the above

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They are all scholars I admire

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
i was thinking

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hey, what is the extent of this?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Only then can we be told

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
After working here for 26 years

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
finally it's my turn

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I feel very honored

66
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So what I'm going to tell you today is

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
is when history meets gender

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The subtitle says to use this

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
"The Sixth Century Collected by Futu"

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Bhikkhu Yuanning Muzhi collapsed to talk about it

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In fact, the main thing is to use this chip

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
come be a shadow

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hope to share with you

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
some in recent years

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sex with Women's History

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
or historical research

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
on the relevant results

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
this should be opened first

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
After opening

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
yes not open yet

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So pressing it won't work

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
open?

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
yes to this not to this

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry, thank you

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This year is Academia Sinica

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
90th Anniversary Celebration

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It is also the celebration of the 90th anniversary of more than ten institutes

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Actually 90 years ago

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
when the unit was established

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
in Chinese history

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
basically

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Not long after the May Fourth Movement

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
probably still receiving

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Impact of the May Fourth Movement

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
under the influence of

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
at that moment

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
almost

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
almost 90 years ago

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
From one book to today

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
are still influential

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
everyone may also read

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
many teenage friends

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Young friends, at least I was the same

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,640
When I first came into contact with the study of women's history

105
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,040
a book that will come across

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,400
That was around 1926 or 28

107
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
It was also a book published almost 90 years ago

108
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,640
Chen Dongyuan's Life History of Chinese Women

109
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,960
In the earliest part of that book he was

110
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
In fact, it was issued by the Commerce Department

111
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,000
Later in Taiwan, Taiwan Business also printed

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,200
I own these two

113
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,320
One is the first teacher of my women's envoy

114
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,760
Teacher Bao Jialing gave it to me

115
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,320
When I was a freshman in National Taiwan University

116
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,480
he is my mentor

117
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
And he was just coming back from America

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
One year

119
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,200
That's still assigned a tutor

120
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I was lucky enough to be his tutor

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
Then he gave me a copy

122
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,840
this blue leather

123
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,880
I'm still on that desk

124
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,480
Later, because of reluctance

125
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,760
keep touching because it is very old

126
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,360
So I went and bought a pink one myself

127
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Use it to browse, use it to check information

128
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,000
There is a passage in this book

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,960
I was from a very young age of nineteen

130
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
I was very impressed when I saw it at the age of eighteen or nineteen

131
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,720
He said my book

132
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm not trying to support some Holy Mother

133
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,560
I don't want to push for some empress

134
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,280
Female heroes vent their anger on women

135
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,000
Because most people

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,280
girls don't matter

137
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,580
i just want to point out

138
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
What kind of gaffe is the idea that men are superior to women

139
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,880
What kind of Zengsheng is the destruction of women

140
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,380
What kind of historical regression still weighs on the number of women now

141
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,420
That is to say around 1926 2728

142
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,160
It is the May 4th movement that wants to overthrow the old tradition

143
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
Then bring new thinking

144
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,760
In the process of new atmosphere

145
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,160
In fact, women's identity, women's status, women's situation

146
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,000
scholars or intellectuals

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,840
An indicator of great concern

148
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,040
So Chen Dongyuan wrote such a book

149
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,140
His purpose is to tell everyone

150
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,680
The lives of women in China are actually very miserable

151
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,420
He wants to tell everyone the fact

152
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,660
Then we need to draw everyone's attention, hoping to reform

153
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,620
Then you can have a change of heart

154
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,860
Right around the time this book was published

155
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,360
around this time

156
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
Another thing was actually unearthed in Luoyang

157
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,600
that's what we're going to talk about today

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,140
Wei Gujiang

159
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
open it

160
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,740
Wei Gujiang, General Wei Gu Cheji

161
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,340
Safety

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wen Dingxing sends his wife the preface

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Anyone who can finish reading can be a historian

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A man who can eat a mouthful of youth can speak

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This Mu Zhiming was about 80 or 90 years ago

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Unearthed in Luoyang, Henan

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then he received in

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
After being unearthed by Fujinen Makishi above

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There are collapsed pieces, that is, after falling down with this ink tile

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Then this piece is now in the collection

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Academia Sinica Lishi Research Institute

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It is in the Fujinian library of my unit

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then his size is about

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
57×57 cm

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So this screen actually magnifies it a little bit.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you go to Futu to see this collapse

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's not that big

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That is to say, its original tombstone was not so big.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But it's a bit big

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Gravestone with a little weight

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And then the collapse

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
On the login of Shi Yu's office, it says

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sir Yuan Ni Mu Zhiming Bing Xu

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's the front and the back

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,240
There is this preface stating that such a person is buried in it

186
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
Then the hostess that Mu Zhiming talked about

187
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,000
what kind of person is he

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,040
what about his age

189
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,840
Because in this place for the second year of Yongan

190
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,560
So there is a seven-day holiday in November Monokage

191
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,960
So we know that the shepherd

192
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,600
This mu, Muzi was in the second year of Yong'an, and he was in the north.

193
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,200
It was built in 529, the second year of Yong'an

194
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,560
so we can know

195
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,320
This, this, Mu Zhiming, was around that time

196
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
That thing is about the same

197
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,120
It is in this turbulent May Fourth

198
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,400
In the process of this trend

199
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,000
was found trampled

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Later, I received them from 11 libraries.

201
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,000
That's what we're talking about here

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,080
In this bhikkhu garden

203
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,880
The woman Mu Zhiming talked about

204
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,840
what kind of story is it

205
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,000
Actually I was hoping

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
if today was in my class

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,520
I will ask the students to read it

208
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
break this shepherd's back

209
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,440
then think

210
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
Everyone can be more awake

211
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
Then enter the condition

212
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,600
But it doesn't look like it's here

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,680
They all look old and have white hair and long hair, they are older than me

214
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,440
I am too embarrassed to ask everyone to read this Mu Zhiming

215
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,940
But so I figured it out

216
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,440
Type this into a normal text file

217
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Hope to let you know more

218
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
at least understand what this is talking about

219
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,940
Let's take a look at the nomination just now

220
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,440
He said that he is the general of car technology

221
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,220
Ping Shu Written Actions

222
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,520
Mrs. Ji

223
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,780
Grand Jazz Monk Yuan Ning Mu Zhiming continued

224
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
So just by looking at the title, you can probably guess

225
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
the first he was a bhikkhunin

226
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
That is, he is a nun

227
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,800
And his bhikkhu ning the monastery where he became a monk

228
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
or the temple he belongs to is grand lord

229
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Great Jazz of Luoyang

230
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,800
He died in the identity of the monk Ning Luoyang

231
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
But this identity is his last identity

232
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
not all his identities

233
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
can see ahead of him

234
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
one of his identities is

235
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
He is Mrs. Xing Gong Ji

236
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,820
That is to say, a certain line

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
sacrifice of man

238
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,840
is the palace

239
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,000
In fact, we checked the information

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,440
I know it's a row wheel

241
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,160
He is the empress of the history of Northwest University

242
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,040
a very important general

243
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,840
But it is said that he is also very personable

244
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
dashing and handsome

245
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
There may also be ministerial civil servants

246
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,360
such a patient person

247
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,160
no matter what

248
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,800
This round mud made his sacrifice, Mrs. Sacrifice

249
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,040
After becoming the wife of the sacrifice

250
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,400
later he died

251
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,920
As a bhikkhu Yuanni

252
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,480
buried after death

253
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,560
that this

254
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,760
What is this Mu Zhiming talking about?

255
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,480
First

256
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
Mrs Hui Cunda

257
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,640
rule of law

258
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,240
Grandson of Emperor Gongzong

259
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
Rencheng the fifth daughter of King Kang

260
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,880
So it looks like he belongs to the emperor's family

261
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,480
right

262
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,120
his father was a certain prince

263
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,000
he is the prince

264
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,680
Recognized as Kang Wang's fifth daughter

265
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,880
Then Mu Zhiming, if everyone

266
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,360
Read a little bit of Mu Zhiming's words

267
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,080
Or don't be Mu Zhiming

268
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,120
That is, if there is always the opportunity to attend a funeral

269
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,080
like me

270
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
then you might

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You'll read a lot of stories like this

272
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,400
People don't call shapes anymore

273
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,600
life story

274
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
It's usually very well written.

275
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,000
Regardless of whether this child used to

276
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,200
when this person was young

277
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,700
how to get along with this man

278
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,800
No matter what this person's past

279
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,700
naughty missile

280
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,500
But what about in Kinokana is usually good

281
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,000
Packing fish have poor jobs and poor forests

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,100
are very beautiful

283
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,800
It looks beautiful and the wind is good

284
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,500
flag from year

285
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,400
rocking boat filet

286
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,700
When he was very young and his hair was short

287
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
smart at a young age

288
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,700
And what about his demeanor?

289
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,400
When he tied the heads of two little uncles

290
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,800
it can already be seen

291
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,700
is such a daughter

292
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,400
a girl

293
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,500
Kang Wang loves his father more

294
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,700
It is recommended to pay attention to women

295
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,900
love him very much

296
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,300
different from other daughters

297
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,600
Long live in the arms never leave the applause

298
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
But at the age of seven

299
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,100
his father died

300
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,300
he is very filial

301
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,800
know without learning

302
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,100
father died very loving love hurt

303
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,400
Qi and blood worry

304
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,100
cry every day like

305
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,240
What comes out is not tears but blood

306
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,140
What I eat seems to be eating the curse karma

307
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,140
By the age of fifteen

308
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,240
Positive is when girls pull their hair up

309
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,540
when you can get married

310
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,240
Pastor Yan Gui married a man surnamed Mu

311
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:12,980
who is the pastor

312
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,920
In fact, this is from the Northern Wei Dynasty, that is Wei.

313
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,580
guard

314
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,180
Then see General Gu Cheji

315
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,780
So I know he too

316
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,620
He is both other people's

317
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,660
His husband, Xinggong, has also passed away.

318
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,160
Then this Tuoba in the Northern Wei Dynasty

319
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
They were originally in this ancestor's

320
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,720
His original surname was Tuoba

321
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,300
Later, because of the Sinicization of the school text

322
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,700
Change to Yuan

323
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,200
This Tuoba and Mu

324
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,860
Both are ancestors, very important

325
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,600
military aristocratic group

326
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
Then the two families will Tuoba and Mu

327
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,600
Yuan Hemu

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,380
are often married

329
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,680
So when he was fifteen

330
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,980
she married Mu

331
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,640
then he was very

332
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,340
This is what the shepherds must have

333
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,520
very hard

334
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,180
Female workers are very burdened

335
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,880
The results of it

336
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,120
Mr. Mu

337
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,640
died shortly after

338
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,120
half

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Half of his body collapsed

340
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
what half of the body fell down

341
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
When a woman marries each other, the two become one

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
after being united

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If the husband dies, the woman will

344
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The other half of the body fell down.

345
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
no more

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so very sad

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
he wants to be able to triple

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What is the so-called triple?

349
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
repeated marriage at home

350
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Repeat Resurrection Baryon

351
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But he had hoped so

352
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But his elder brother and wife, King Wenxuan

353
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The wife of King Wen Xuan is called Yuan Cheng

354
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's Yuan Ni's brother Yuan Cheng

355
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The only duoqing smoke is not allowed

356
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
against his morals

357
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Violating Yuan Ni's morality

358
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
robbed him of his emotions

359
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Just don't let him triple

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that means

361
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
must remarry

362
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
remarry

363
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
so who will you marry

364
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and then the next

365
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is it

366
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ping Shu Wen Ding Xinggong

367
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
General Xiang

368
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I just said that

369
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Everyone thinks it's rich

370
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There are dancing money

371
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yun belongs to the relationship between Emperor Wen and Xiao Wenli

372
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,900
Very good, the air is like the rain Jun Cheng and the two are like the rain

373
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,000
The joy of rain is not just for men and women

374
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,300
It is Mu Zhimingyan who is in the north

375
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,100
You can tell it's like rain

376
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,900

Then this Yuan Ni will be his spouse

380
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,700
The two of them are as good as a harp and as harmonious as a smoker

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,700
Unspoken

385
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,300
It just shows how good the relationship between the two of them is.

386
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
what does good mean

387
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,000
He also has a very good relationship with her husband when he is at home.

388
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,300
So good, how can the relationship be very good?

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,200

Very respectful and filial to him

394
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Treat him like a gangster, Hirohito

395
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Treat him like nobody else, this girl

396
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
mother-in-law good

397
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
to honor him

398
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,800
on the other hand

399
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
be mediocre

400
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
He is the egg

401
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,000
This Yuan Ni

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
This Mrs. Yuan and the egg

403
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
original other concubine

404
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,000
get along very well

405
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,300
able to help evil

406
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,000
It's a pleasure to get along with them

407
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
on the other hand

408
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,200
Son, a prostitute is a man

409
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Chang Shixun

410
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
There is a shape

411
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
is one of his sons

412
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Is this Yuan Ni's son?

413
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,200
it doesn't look like

414
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Son Chang Shixun, a casual prostitute

415
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,600
Yuan can be stronger or stronger

416
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,200
Sheng Shan Juan En Qu was home

417
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Empathetic and Empress Dowager

418
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,500
out of the dragon

419
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,300
What's the meaning

420
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,600
this is actually

421
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,400
Oval

422
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,100
former wife's son

423
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,700
Then Yuan Moumou

424
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,400
Yuan Pure

425
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,900
after marriage

426
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,400
What about the original son?

427
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,800
see him when he was little

428
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,900
no mother

429
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,600
so love him very much

430
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,000
what is the degree of love

431
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,900
higher than

432
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
more than one's own birth

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Just love this season

434
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
love their own children

435
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
more grand

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
below the level of

437
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
he lives here

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Xinranjia

439
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm talking about this part

440
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yuan Chuntuo's life after marriage

441
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Then what next, he began to think

442
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
how does he teach this young son

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What about this season?

444
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Kim Hiran

445
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
As long as there are poems and books in front of his eyes

446
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
also teach this child

447
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
so beautiful

448
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Director of Gongyan

449
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Start function

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yuan Chuntuo can not only read poetry and books

451
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And also work as a maid

452
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
well done too

453
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
any type

454
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Sewing and knitting can't be difficult for him

455
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and he wears clothes

456
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
not very weird

457
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to participate

458
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What about when this idiot sweeps the closet?

459
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I wear clothes that have been washed many times

460
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Doesn't ask to be glamorous

461
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
means a very economical one

462
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
such a woman

463
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Sex can be a female high school mother for a thousand years

464
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Should be a very nice woman

465
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The kind of woman who can be the mother of the world

466
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
can be a woman's guru

467
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Such a person is like the guru of the female group

468
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
In the end, when it comes to the car record, who is it written in the car record?

469
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's messy

470
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
after death

471
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
when died

472
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He is the second widowed

473
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
After his death he privately became Fude

474
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
irreplaceable

475
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is how the pastor described his richness.

476
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What does that mean

477
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
when the husband died

478
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
don't cry at night

479
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
only cry during the day

480
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Crying at night makes people feel

481
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He's just missing his love

482
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
like a widow during the day

483
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Still thinking about the bed

484
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is obviously for the husband

485
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That is to say, he is not a very good rich man.

486
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and there is no way to show

487
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
husband married a

488
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
being a nice rich man

489
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So if it's a nice rich guy

490
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
when the husband died

491
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
it is not allowed to cry at night

492
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
can only cry during the day

493
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
when crying during the day

494
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
On the one hand, this can be avoided

495
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The one who thinks about the room all day long

496
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Two words or two names

497
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
On the other hand

498
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,800
When you cry during the day, you cry with the public

499
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Can demonstrate the virtue of the husband

500
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,400
or his contributions to the public domain, etc.

501
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
but anyway

502
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,900
privately

503
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
In order to be able to demonstrate the virtue of his husband

504
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,100
So he is more irreplaceable

505
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,600
recruit poor and humble

506
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,700
then he lamented

507
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,100
no life

508
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,600
I've been miserable all my life

509
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
two more hard work

510
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
people leave me

511
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,200
Altair

512
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
i didn't i'm ashamed

513
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I didn't keep a moral

514
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
what ethics

515
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,000
There is no second such conduct of his

516
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It turned out that she was married to Mrs. Mu

517
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,800
after death

518
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,500
I was going to be alone and widowed

519
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,800
As a result, my brother won't let me be widowed

520
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
I must be marrying

521
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
Must be after I get married

522
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I become another him

523
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,100
I am ashamed

524
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,300
i didn't hold on

525
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,300
No other one of his worries

526
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
I am ashamed

527
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,600
also very ashamed

528
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,900
my heart does not turn

529
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,500
I turned

530
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
Because I got on well with Xingchao later on.

531
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,900
It looks like it's good, doesn't it?

532
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,240
20 people are so cool, I'm really a lion

533
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,340
If you have no virtue, you will serve another

534
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,580
second husband

535
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,580
But I didn't care about his family any more.

536
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,520
Which means, in the end, it's just emotions anyway.

537
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,480
It turns out that the first mother, the child born to the first wife

538
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,980
This kind of happiness in life comes from suffering, and the fruit comes from the cause

539
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,360
Think about it, it's meaningless, don't go through it again

540
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,440
So sacrifice one's life and get tired of getting out of the body

541
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,000
Looks like he's started reading Buddhist scriptures

542
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,480
Guangtong Precepts Six Degrees of Treasure Noisy Precepts Daughter

543
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,380
Treat a thousand pieces of gold as a quarrel ring

544
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,580
Just think of all his practice, reading the scriptures, open it

545
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,620
It's starting to look like he deserves something in return

546
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,720
It is he who is cultivating to this matter

547
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,920
When should something be rewarded? The shadow of the twin scales wears out

548
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,260
Suddenly this practice is a temple

549
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,940
This kind of shadow of this kind of environment

550
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,800
It was this shadow that suddenly disappeared.

551
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,960
What do you mean? It means he's not sick himself.

552
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
no way to live

553
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,960
The third person will appear next

554
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,800
who

555
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,400
Wei Qing, king of Xihe

556
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,840
king of the river

557
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,040
It's called Yuan Wei Qing

558
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,200
Priest

559
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,840
and grandson

560
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,760
Do you understand

561
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,480
understand

562
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,480
third person on stage

563
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,240

564
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,680

base

566
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,120

567
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,160

569
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,240
Edom October

570
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,760
Stingray Nutrition Junjie Hotel

571
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,440
etc.

572
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,280
What's the meaning

573
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,560
that is

574
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Let's talk about him first

575
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,240
His father loved him very much when he was a child

576
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,120
then at the age of seven

577
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,840
father passed away

578
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,040
he cried virtuously

579
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,240
like a girl

580
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
Married at fifteen

581
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
The original Tuoba long-term alliance

582
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,160
A family of the military-political alliance

583
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,960
Then what

584
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,360
apparently had a daughter

585
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,200
Although the front side

586
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,000
No mention of having a daughter at all

587
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,680
right

588
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,600
But apparently there is a daughter

589
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,960
because of that daughter

590
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Later she married Yuan

591
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So that's what I just said

592
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yuan and Mu have been married for a long time

593
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He married Mu

594
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
gave birth to a daughter, of course the surname is Mu

595
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Later this daughter surnamed Mu married back to Yuan

596
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's from his own family

597
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So another child was born named Yuan Weiqing

598
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yuan Weiqing when his wife was sick

599
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm working on Xihe Wang and I'm working on a mobile phone

600
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Dungeon Mengrun looks like it is in Luoyang

601
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's a very important official, the first official

602
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Then the pastor Xihe Wang Weiqing was the wife's grandson at the beginning.

603
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
the son of his daughter

604
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He is a master, how good he is

605
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Then the lady got sick when she went to live with him

606
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The result is in his, in Yuan Weiqing's

607
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Nutritious Bacteria Sister's Annex One of his mansions

608
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If you die in this villa, you will die there

609
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,900
Dead grandson Momowa Zisu all heart

610
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,260
That is, no matter who is a monk

611
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Ordinary people who have not left home

612
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,540
Everyone loves it

613
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,100
Because he should be able to be a female high school mother for a thousand years

614
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,300
how did you die

615
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,100
just cry

616
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,160
before dying

617
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,460
dying suddenly

618
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,500
Clearly lost

619
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,700
Don't bury his sleepy heart of cultivating Taoism

620
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,660
What's the meaning

621
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
I've already said it

622
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
twenty minutes

623
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,860
What's the meaning

624
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,560
What's the meaning

625
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,200
Zhu Chenyan, since you are here

626
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
You said there's a microphone over there

627
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:35,800
take a look

628
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,200
yes

629
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,800
He woke up on his deathbed, woke up suddenly

630
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,000
Looks like he died while living at his grandson's house

631
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,040
before dying

632
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
Woke up suddenly and asked to say

633
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,280
He doesn't want to follow the one in front

634
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,980
Don't bury what he meant, yes

635
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,240
Just don't marry any of the previous husbands

636
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,120
buried together

637
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,480
Don't be buried with the expert

638
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
because this

639
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,020
don't be buried with the pastor

640
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,120
Because that was her ex-husband after all.

641
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,920
Seems to make sense

642
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,660
but no matter what

643
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,400
He lived in the little child born to the priest

644
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,620
home is his grandson's home

645
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,860
So it's a little bit unreasonable

646
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,500
Then don't be buried with the expert

647
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,260
Pedestrians buried together

648
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:32,000
Of course, it was very different from the custom at that time.

649
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,700
At that time, many couples and funeral mothers

650
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,900
It's the couple buried together

651
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,840
This means that we will always be united, etc.

652
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,800
but he doesn't want

653
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,340
He specifically stated that he would not

654
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,900
Please don't bury his heart that he cultivated at the age of

655
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,600
The results of it

656
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Sons and daughters are respectful and dare not stop

657
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,700
they can't stop listening to him

658
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,740
I agreed

659
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,100
It's fine after you promise

660
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,180
I will be buried in a certain day and a certain year

661
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,540
Buried next to Luoyang

662
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,420
Beside Maan Hill

663
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,920
This front is the so-called narrative

664
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
is the narrative

665
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,020
Because of Mu Zhiming

666
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,300
This civilization is actually a famous text like a singing language

667
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,700
four words four words four words

668
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,300
Then we need to explain why there is this sequence later.

669
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
will have this name

670
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,900
so its words about

671
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,400
what about the word

672
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,900
Of course, just sing him like this, how, how, how

673
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,300
the last word says

674
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,900
Of course, these are what we just talked about

675
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,800
In fact, the sequence of the content is almost the same.

676
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,300
It means to tell him how he is doing, okay?

677
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,200
but in the end

678
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,300
Life, birth and fortune

679
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,000
One return to trickle, no repeated injury

680
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,100
human life is short

681
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,500
The time after death is longer than the time in life

682
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,100
Twin Scales In-laws Wind Cup Baiyang

683
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
even so

684
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,700
the man who wrote his name

685
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,900
still hope

686
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
Will lie in the blue night, there is no absolute way

687
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,100
that is

688
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,500
his people are buried here

689
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
set up a cup

690
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,700
wrote the name

691
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,700
And it also shows that his voice

692
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,800
There are also flowers beside

693
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
Although life is short

694
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,900
time gone

695
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,200
not alive time

696
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Time is much longer than living time

697
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,100
those these

698
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
these creams and more

699
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
is the wind

700
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,240
these trees

701
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,440
these trees next to

702
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,680
when it comes to winter

703
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,720
Maybe it's frosting too

704
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,520
it's cold

705
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,320
The whole north wind blows up

706
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,120
it feels like weeping

707
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,080
probably so

708
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,560
There's nothing wrong with the atmosphere

709
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,160
but at the end

710
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,360
He wants this guy who writes wood to say

711
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,520
Paint Wolan Wan

712
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
I mean these flower beds

713
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,400
paved these

714
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,160
those who planted these flowers

715
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,360
these flowers beside the wood

716
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,000
Hope to be forever apart

717
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,960
don't stop

718
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
can still last forever

719
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,160
equal to this

720
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,440
one of the dead

721
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,040
Blessings to the future world

722
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,600
such a world

723
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,080
In fact, this wooden name

724
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,240
You see I was hoping to invite you over here

725
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,440
audience come

726
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,800
to share

727
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,880
I read this

728
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,920
As a result, I did not expect that I would

729
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,840
It took 20 minutes to finish it

730
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,720
Who is the author of this wooden name

731
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,560
whoever wrote it

732
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,160
honestly

733
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,000
we don't really know

734
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,960
because he didn't

735
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,840
In the end, there was no withdrawal and said who was so and so

736
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,600
do so so so

737
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,880
wait wait wait

738
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,160
But you from this content

739
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,040
You should be able to guess

740
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
He should have been commissioned by someone from the Xingya family.

741
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Because he wrote only two or three sentences about the marriage with the pastor

742
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Lian Yuan didn't even talk about having a daughter.

743
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
If he hadn't died in his grandson's house in the end

744
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Maybe we'll never know that he ever

745
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Had a child in the first marriage

746
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But the second marriage is a lot

747
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And dad doesn't just write about his own virtues

748
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
How to serve this mother-in-law

749
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How to follow these eggs

750
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Other concubines get along well

751
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
how to teach journalists

752
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
At the same time, it also discusses how the eggs will be judged and supervised.

753
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
such an amazing person

754
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
In fact, there are profits in the practice of egg guarding.

755
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
After checking, he was indeed very handsome and silly, etc.

756
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But this pastor is actually the pastor of Yuanquan Camel

757
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But he also brought a sum of eggs

758
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
said some good things about him

759
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
At the same time, the news is that this son

760
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
also said some good things

761
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What about the other side?

762
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
the virtues described in

763
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
basically looks like

764
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
All belong to Chinese

765
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It is the virtue after the Confucian dialect of the Han dialect of Beiwei Tuoba

766
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,560
For example, it should be Pomponla and it should be cut in half.

767
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,960
Should be able to love Long even though it wasn't born by me

768
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
I love him more than I ever gave birth to myself

769
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Or be able to work as a female worker and read teachers' books Li Yue

770
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,160
From these angles it would appear that

771
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,560
This shepherd, although we do not know who the author is

772
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,760
Basically, it should be the home of eggs.

773
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,400
It is the people in his second husband's family

774
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,960
Please someone write a shepherd like this

775
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,600
I don’t know how you feel about this shepherd

776
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
If you've seen this shepherd, start reading with us

777
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,600
It was about the same time that this shepherd was unearthed

778
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
We know the age of the shepherds 1920's 30's

779
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,400
According to the life history of Chinese women we just read by Chen Dongyu

780
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
I don't want to see some queens and heroines

781
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,200
I think how miserable it is for a woman's male director to be inferior

782
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,600
Read these two things at about the same time

783
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,000
Because this thing has been kept in the father and son's library

784
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,800
Not many people know about this blockbuster

785
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,400
often in the library

786
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
In fact, until the first time I knew about this thing

787
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,100
Of course

788
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,840
Probably decades after it was unearthed

789
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,580
Received on an untouched South American wooden tread

790
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,280
or in these books

791
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,680
but no research

792
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
really have research i see

793
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,340
I'm probably the first

794
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,520
when I was writing my doctoral dissertation

795
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,980
After returning from the United States, I went to the Fox Union Library to check information

796
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,580
then i found

797
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,060
There's a wooden tread like this

798
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,820
This is the life of this woman

799
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,160
when i was in college

800
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,400
The life history of Chinese women sent to me by the teacher who read Ba Zhuo

801
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,460
So I see that women's lives actually seem to be different

802
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,600
so i was curious

803
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,100
i want to know

804
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,400
How exactly do women live their lives?

805
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,980
what happened

806
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,240
Does this wooden name tell us something

807
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,740
In the life history of Chinese women

808
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,580
Aspects that will not be touched

809
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,080
Then in the 1990s I wrote my doctoral dissertation

810
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,220
The 90s were all 24 seasons

811
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,180
in the 90s

812
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,260
I finished my doctoral dissertation

813
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,860
I used a story like this

814
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,500
Recently, due to the need for more in-depth analysis

815
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,760
because you are participating in different anthologies

816
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,300
project translation project etc.

817
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,000
I put the wooden name very carefully

818
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
read it again

819
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
After reading it, you will find that

820
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,800
When living with Chinese women

821
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,300
In fact, women's lives presented

822
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,100
may be different

823
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,900
what is a different place

824
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,700
First

825
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,600
He married twice

826
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,300
that's where we are

827
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,700
May Fourth

828
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
struggle here

829
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,600
to struggle

830
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,400
one of them is

831
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,100
Needle survey

832
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,200
offhand day problem

833
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,500
this was popular at the time

834
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,000
not popular

835
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,600
a painful thing

836
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,200
not popular

837
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,700
That is to say, the painful thing at that time

838
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,900
But Chinese history has not always been

839
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,100
What I saw on May 4th

840
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,600
their previous state

841
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,100
in what we found

842
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,600
Yuanchun camel's wooden inside found

843
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,600
There was a time in Chinese history

844
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,500
women's situation

845
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,600
or the form of his life

846
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,300
It's actually different

847
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,100
or the status of his marriage

848
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,700
In fact, it's not the hand festival at home

849
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,600
no wrist

850
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,500
no wrist

851
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,600
Widowed

852
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,800
get a needle survey

853
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,600
can be at home

854
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,100
Does that mean he has a higher status?

855
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:53,700
uncertain

856
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,600
because he said he

857
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,500
His brother is the only one who is passionate

858
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,800
He wants wristbands

859
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,100
My brother won't let him hold hands

860
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
we look again

861
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
So it's not what he said

862
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,300
If Won Chun asked Key to stand up today and say

863
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,600
No, in fact, I really wanted to revalue

864
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
It's just that I can't help it if they just write it like this

865
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,500
I do not know

866
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,200
This will only be known after the chicken

867
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,300
How can we get the ancients to tell us the truth?

868
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,000
But even if the ancients really come back

869
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,200
They tell the truth we don't know

870
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
because we are now face to face

871
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Not necessarily telling the truth, right?

872
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
How can you believe that the one with the chicken came back

873
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,300
just tell the truth

874
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,200
This is getting further and further away. Don't worry about him.

875
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,700
but i mean

876
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,200
It is true that re-price is a norm in Raising and Zhimin

877
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,000
This is a fact

878
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,100
In fact, after reading other materials, we

879
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,300
will also find

880
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
The so-called widowed, widowed, needle knot, defense

881
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,600
These things were indeed a sore spot when the samurai

882
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
But not in Chinese history

883
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,000
It's always been like this

884
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,500
The second is to say

885
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,700
after he was widowed twice

886
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,200
He finds his life boring

887
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,600
I don't want to live like this

888
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,000
what can he do

889
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,300
he became a monk

890
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,400
he decided to become a monk

891
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,500
Without people also head towards the pond

892
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,900
As far as we are concerned, women in medieval China

893
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,500
In fact, apart from getting married

894
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,000
There is another thing you can do

895
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,100
is to become a monk

896
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
and become a monk

897
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
like he looks like

898
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,400
Life is really hard like this

899
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,100
not interesting

900
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,900
Widowed twice, I became a monk

901
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,100
But after leaving home it looks like

902
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,300
he can read

903
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,200
Bo collection gold account

904
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,000
also read commandments

905
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,700
what else

906
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
did you really read

907
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,100
Literacy and reading

908
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,800
we're not really sure

909
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,700
Because people in the past called reading

910
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,400
Sometimes someone else reads to him

911
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,900
If he can understand, it means he has read

912
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,700
This is also a way of reading

913
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,600
sometimes really read by yourself

914
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,100
Sometimes you can recognize a few words

915
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,200
but some don't know

916
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,700
Then ask others to read it together

917
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,900
In fact, the situation is not necessarily

918
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,100
but anyway

919
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,300
after becoming a monk

920
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,700
if he is not a noblewoman

921
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,100
He's just an ordinary girl

922
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,300
he may not have a chance

923
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,500
what reading teacher book

924
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,300
Li Yue

925
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,000
He was in this second husband's house just now

926
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,600
But after all, when he was at the home of his second husband

927
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
It seems that some texts have been touched

928
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
After becoming a monk

929
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,100
He started collecting money

930
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,100
read about Buddhism

931
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,000
he likes himself

932
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,600
It's the interest of another world

933
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
looks like

934
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,800
It's also a good time

935
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,700
not enough

936
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,060
Grand Jazz

937
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,240
But he ended up going to live in his grandson's house

938
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,840
In fact, there are different studies

939
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,140
What does that mean

940
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,520
After the Tang Dynasty

941
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,580
the forest

942
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,840
Be it a monk or a nun

943
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,640
You can't run around, bhikkhu or bhikkhu

944
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,680
The government of the Tang Dynasty was stricter

945
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,980
where do you become a monk

946
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
not place an order

947
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,680
I've already said which unit I'm in

948
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,580
You must practice in that unit

949
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,860
don't run around

950
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,120
But in the unprecedented U.S. and North Korea

951
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,420
Because Buddhism has only just emerged

952
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,820
and still preaching

953
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,720
still looking for someone

954
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,320
still pulling people

955
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,020
still in the process of becoming a believer

956
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,620
In fact, the government does not

957
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,620
Also very re-entering Buddhism

958
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,520
I didn't care about so many circumstances

959
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,220
You'll find what's called Big Jazz Round Clay

960
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,900
The place where you run around and live is not necessarily in Big Jazz

961
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,560
Finally, when you get sick and die, you need someone to take care of you

962
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,660
not in big jazz either

963
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,040
Instead, he went to live in his grandson's house.

964
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,000
And he died at his grandson's house

965
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,700
on the other hand

966
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,500
His grandson's family passed away

967
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,040
It is also related to our history of women's life in China

968
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
s got woman's

969
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,300
The impression after marriage is different

970
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,100
That is to say

971
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,860
why would he follow a

972
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,000
Daughter from his previous first marriage

973
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,900
the daughter's later son

974
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,300
live together

975
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,400
According to what we have read about the life history of Chinese women

976
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
Impressions of Chinese History

977
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,800
Chinese women's traditional Chinese women's

978
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,000
impression of this life

979
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,100
should mean

980
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,000
If he was Sir Johnny

981
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
The government is not very strict

982
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,900
if he can go home

983
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,100
He should go back and follow the news

984
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,000
and his descendants

985
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,700
right

986
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,800
Since he gets along so well with Ji Zi

987
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,400
Great righteousness makes people come out of themselves

988
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,700
Ji Zi loves him too

989
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,500
two like

990
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,800
good relationship

991
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,200
The relationship with the experts is also very good.

992
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,700
Then if he wants to go home

993
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,600
or when he is sick

994
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,800
or when he is alone

995
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,300
Shouldn't he be going home?

996
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Obviously not

997
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,600
he is actually

998
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
to his original first marriage

999
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,000
the daughter

1000
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,100
the son born

1001
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,200
not mentioned at all

1002
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,700
the gaze of his daughter

1003
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,000
so it's possible in

1004
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,580
When Yuan Chuntuo was widowed for the second time

1005
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,780
His own daughter may have died

1006
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,080
may not know

1007
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,500
It's also possible that his daughter lived with his son.

1008
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,580
That is, living with Yuan Chuntuo's grandson

1009
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,080
So when he went to find his grandson

1010
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,700
In fact, to find the daughter he gave birth to

1011
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,280
But that is to say, although in the so-called patriarchal ethics

1012
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,380
A wife should always focus on her husband

1013
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,180
Husband's mother is my mother

1014
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,880
My husband's son is my son

1015
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
My husband's family is my family

1016
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,080
But Yuan Chuntuo is obviously not like this

1017
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,220
He is closer to the one he was born with

1018
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,620
This leads us to the mother-child relationship

1019
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,760
Or mother-daughter relationship or parent-child relationship

1020
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,260
In the age we see

1021
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,560
This is the era in which Yuan Chuntuo appeared

1022
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,460
What kind of parent-child relationship is it?

1023
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,960
Is it the kind mentioned in the Chinese women's living room later?

1024
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,000
A parent-child relationship that seems to be based on the patriarchal family

1025
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,760
The parent-child relationship in this era

1026
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,400
or what it means to be a mother

1027
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
It has also aroused the curiosity of historians

1028
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
At the end of the interesting part, I will tell you a little more at the end

1029
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,500
Why do you say Dungeon Maker?

1030
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,000
Just now I said that Xihe Wang Yuanweiqing was the successor of Luoyang.

1031
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
very important

1032
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,500
In fact, this time is already the end of the year in the north.

1033
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,000
not long

1034
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Probably not a few years later the North will perish

1035
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,500
In fact at this time

1036
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,000
Zu Yong'an is the year name of Emperor Xiaoming in the north

1037
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,500
But in fact, when Emperor Xiaoming was in power,

1038
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,000
Basically he is not in charge

1039
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
it's his mother

1040
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,500
This is the Queen Mother

1041
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
that is a heroine

1042
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,000
a political queen

1043
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So, when Yuan Cunda lived in this age

1044
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
In fact, China is historically

1045
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,500
women can remarry

1046
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Whether he wants to or not

1047
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,000
Anyway, he doesn't have the obligation to keep the chastity.

1048
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,500
At the same time, besides his marriage

1049
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,000
There is also the opportunity to become a monk

1050
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
On the other hand, he may have a relationship with his parents and children.

1051
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,500
very tight

1052
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,000
what it means to be a mother

1053
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,020
very important

1054
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,060
another one is

1055
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:04,100
This is actually an era ruled by a heroine

1056
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,380
not a male emperor

1057
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,660
In public opinion, he is the male emperor

1058
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,700
But the real ruler is actually this

1059
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,240
emperor's mother

1060
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,040
That means the role of mother

1061
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,080
In fact, it is very important in this era

1062
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,100
from here

1063
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,140
we found out

1064
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:19,460
This is basically talking about the period from the Qin and Han Dynasties to Shishi

1065
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,480
It's what we call medieval history

1066
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,500
but i'll get to that later

1067
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,560
Probably not exactly limited to this time

1068
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,860
Because of the different aspects of Chinese history

1069
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,400
change, time, ups and downs

1070
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,240
It is not necessarily possible to use the political tide to stop and stop

1071
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,560
If we look at Yuan Cuntou's life story, we will find that

1072
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,400
In fact, the so-called respect for the seven generations of the husband or respecting the husband

1073
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,660
that is, by law

1074
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,440
legally

1075
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,020
The core is the idea that the husband is the main axis

1076
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,320
There may be something different in this day and age

1077
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,120
On the other hand, mother and son

1078
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,680
May reveal a new fertility culture

1079
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,200
This is also a historian

1080
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,740
pondering place

1081
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,520
Then there is

1082
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,800
widowed monk

1083
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,840
Widowed women may also become ordained

1084
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,100
never married girl

1085
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,120
Maybe he became a monk in his teens

1086
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,400
Said he was leaving home

1087
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,600
It is possible in this era

1088
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,700
So scholars of the history of religion have also been inspired by this

1089
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
start doing research

1090
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
on the other hand

1091
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,000
Chen Dongyuan says

1092
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,900
I don't want to talk about female emperors and heroines venting their anger on women

1093
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,400
Because these people have nothing to do with ordinary women

1094
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,100
What is the meaning of talking about female Wu Zetian

1095
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,900
no use at all

1096
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,300
Actually still useful

1097
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,200
see what you say

1098
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,800
If you take Wu Zetian as saying that she is venting her anger for a woman

1099
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,100
Of course it's useless

1100
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,800
But if Wu Zetian's appearance

1101
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,300
placed in a series of historical developments

1102
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,600
In the context of political history

1103
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,300
Why is there such a female emperor?

1104
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,900
The only one in Chinese history

1105
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,300
Scholars of political history may have something to say

1106
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
it makes sense to talk about

1107
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,200
It is the characteristic of national culture

1108
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,400
or interracial contact

1109
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,500
Or a change in the concept of class

1110
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,200
When these things are added together

1111
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,800
In fact, it’s all because historical research didn’t want to learn from women

1112
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,200
or gender perspective

1113
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,000
But if from a gender point of view

1114
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,100
rethinking legal history

1115
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,200
When medical history is compared with religious history or political history

1116
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,700
we may see something different

1117
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,500
The pure wood is just right

1118
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,600
All fit. Let's look at something like this

1119
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,900
If the law makes us talk about basically

1120
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,700
Chinese law probably started after the Tang Dynasty

1121
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,800
It has been established that the so-called Five Blessings are used to punish people

1122
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
What's the meaning

1123
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,400
what is five blessings

1124
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
does anyone know

1125
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,100
Does anyone know what Wufu is?

1126
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,400
Can you see it here?

1127
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,700
If there is a self here, have you seen yourself?

1128
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,600
own father died

1129
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,400
I have to serve him for three years

1130
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,500
own brother died

1131
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,800
I have to serve him for a year

1132
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,700
own grandfather died

1133
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,600
own grandfather died

1134
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,000
Take nourishing reminder for one year

1135
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,500
Tang Brothers Passed Away in September

1136
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,400
Don brothers' child dies

1137
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,200
I mourn for him

1138
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,600
Fu Xiaogong May

1139
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,600
grandson of tang brothers dies

1140
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,000
I served his dead horse for three months

1141
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,200
sound like proper nouns

1142
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
what the hell is this talking about

1143
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,700
Cut and blow the broken sound

1144
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,100
It doesn't matter if you cut it inside

1145
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,800
cut blow means

1146
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,900
very tattered sackcloth

1147
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,300
The sackcloth is torn to the bottom

1148
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
no seams

1149
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,100
like cut it

1150
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:16,900
rotten

1151
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,600
very very bad sackcloth

1152
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,200
And the edges are not sewn

1153
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,500
Wearing this sackcloth for three years

1154
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,100
Why

1155
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,900
because my father died

1156
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,300
very very painful

1157
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,200
father is a man's day

1158
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,600
This is in Yili Shangfu

1159
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,900
This whole chart is from Yili Shangfu

1160
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,000
the relationship between the traditional family

1161
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,800
how to define

1162
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,300
by

1163
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,400
that person died

1164
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,800
I wounded for him

1165
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,500
how long to take

1166
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,600
wear rotten sackcloth

1167
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,600
to define the distance between me and him

1168
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,800
Intimacy

1169
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
so if

1170
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,600
i don't know now

1171
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
if you go to a funeral

1172
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
get a reply

1173
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,800
But now everything is electronic

1174
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,600
I do not even know

1175
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,900
Is there anything else I can get?

1176
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,860
If a woman dies

1177
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,840
Sometimes his husband comes out to do funerals for him

1178
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,000
Husband and wife

1179
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,600
Wife is the meaning of a year here

1180
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,140
I read the word "Blowing"

1181
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,680
You can miss your wife if you want

1182
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,220
mean to say

1183
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,540
The death of a brother is not as serious as the death of a father

1184
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,840
still very sad

1185
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,420
But what about the sackcloth with the clothes on?

1186
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,500
It can be sewed, so the wife dies

1187
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,560
And the time to serve in the warehouse is less than three years

1188
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,360
just one year is enough

1189
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,400
That means the father is supreme

1190
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,940
he is my most respected person

1191
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,240
So when he passed away, I beheaded him for three years

1192
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,040
brother of course

1193
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,080
But it didn't reach the level of supreme

1194
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,160
So the sackcloth is a bit better for sewing

1195
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,940
Not even three years

1196
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,480
Just one year

1197
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,760
just a little less

1198
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,440
One year, also called wife

1199
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,580
that is

1200
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,240
During that period, practice making chicken

1201
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,080
but no matter what

1202
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It means taking a year of injury

1203
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
come down the other

1204
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Dagong is linen

1205
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But it's thicker linen

1206
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
slightly thicker like

1207
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
That rotten cloth

1208
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Then he just needs to obey

1209
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Nine months and a little further away

1210
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Minor

1211
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
better again

1212
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Just take it for five months

1213
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Relatives who are far away wear Sima

1214
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Sima is actually quite dense.

1215
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Even without the crappy clothes

1216
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The sackcloth is good but it is good

1217
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Pretty good sackcloth

1218
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
how long to wear for three months

1219
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Therefore, take five servings according to etiquette

1220
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Just take five servings

1221
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
three years one year nine months

1222
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
five months three months

1223
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Paired with bad Zhancui

1224
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
slightly rotten

1225
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But not the worst Zhi Cui

1226
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Then come back to the great and the small

1227
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
five different clothes

1228
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
this type

1229
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
different linen clothes

1230
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
the dead live for the dead

1231
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
what to wear for mourning

1232
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,500
Use this method to show the relationship between a family

1233
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,240
relationship of intimacy

1234
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,240
Well, this intimacy and inferiority are related to the Tang Dynasty

1235
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,000
It becomes placed in Tang Lv Shuyi

1236
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,740
recognized by law

1237
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,040
If you have a murder, a murder, a fight at home

1238
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,540
When someone is injured or someone dies

1239
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,340
If you want to serve him for a year

1240
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,640
Then you hit him and hurt him

1241
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,380
You will be punished more than when two passers-by get into a fight

1242
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,380
It's worse to hurt someone

1243
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,880
if i hit him he hurts

1244
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,380
But he's for me if I die

1245
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,880
He served me for three years

1246
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,380
For example, Zicui, Dagong is ready in September, just give me an example

1247
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,640
It means that he serves me

1248
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,380
Heavier than what I put on him

1249
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,880
He came and beat me

1250
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,380
then i hit him

1251
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,380
Then I shall be punished more than

1252
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,120
Generally, two passers-by kill each other and hurt each other lightly.

1253
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
do you understand me

1254
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,300
That is to say, the parent-book preparation relationship in a family uses this talisman

1255
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,280
So after the Tang Dynasty we saw that in fact

1256
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,240
China has probably always said when judging cases

1257
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,520
case official system

1258
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,180
This case involves symbols

1259
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,380
When someone in the family hurts each other

1260
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,480
Then I'll put it between him and him

1261
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,220
What kind of relationship should it be in the five symbols?

1262
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,820
Who is more respectful and who is more sad

1263
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,920
Who's more dear who compares books

1264
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,220
Sentencing only after confirmation

1265
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,980
The penalty for fighting with two passers-by is different

1266
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,180
meaning that

1267
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,260
This set of concepts of all traditional Chinese etiquette

1268
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,260
put it into the law to implement

1269
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,420
do you know what i mean

1270
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,820
but you can see

1271
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,660
look here

1272
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,400
All men and no women

1273
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,500
how could this be

1274
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,700
what's going on

1275
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,560
because

1276
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,660
What about me if my wife dies?

1277
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,140
Remind him for a year

1278
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,780
But we didn't see that if we are female

1279
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,580
What if the husband dies?

1280
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
same as son

1281
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
This wound that the wife served for her husband

1282
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It's the same wound that the son took for his father

1283
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
it means

1284
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
when a woman marries

1285
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
if she is at home

1286
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
she is a living woman

1287
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
her father died

1288
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
She will take the worst injury

1289
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
for her father

1290
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
once she is married

1291
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
her worst injury

1292
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
for her sir

1293
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
so-called widow

1294
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
originally your father

1295
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Originally your father was your god

1296
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
now once married

1297
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
husband is your god

1298
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
so the wife died

1299
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
The husband only needs to serve his wife for one year

1300
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
wearable sackcloth

1301
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But if the husband dies

1302
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
The wife will serve her husband for three years

1303
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and the worst

1304
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
sackcloth

1305
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
means to show

1306
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Husband honors his wife and mourns

1307
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
what about my son

1308
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
when dad died

1309
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
serve him for three years

1310
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Zhancui three years

1311
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
What about the mother's death?

1312
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
one year

1313
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
mother died

1314
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Take the reminder of a year's injury

1315
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
that is why

1316
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Because although my mother is a close relative

1317
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
But not higher than the Supreme

1318
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
inside a home

1319
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the most respected person

1320
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
can't be taller than him

1321
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The premise is

1322
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Dad is still there, right?

1323
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So the Supreme is still there

1324
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Although the dearest relative died

1325
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You can't be right for him

1326
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So I can only take it for a year

1327
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But if my mother dies

1328
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
my dad has passed away

1329
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I'm not here anymore

1330
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
what to do

1331
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Eloquent

1332
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
you can serve for three years

1333
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
but can't

1334
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Can't wear sharp clothes

1335
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Only wear self-proclaimed clothes

1336
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
just your sackcloth

1337
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
can't be chopped

1338
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Because although your Supreme is dead

1339
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
He will always be your king

1340
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So even though your loved one died

1341
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
you are very sad

1342
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
You want to serve him for three years

1343
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Can

1344
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
but the clothes can't arrive

1345
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
worst level

1346
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
must be between parents

1347
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
There must be a division

1348
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Otherwise, you can't tell the difference

1349
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
who is supreme

1350
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I can't say that it doesn't count if you're dead.

1351
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
He is still supreme

1352
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
so what

1353
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
you can know

1354
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
such a concept

1355
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
This way of distribution

1356
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,740
If you put him in the law

1357
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,440
If you use this thing to sentence

1358
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,440
that is to say

1359
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,240
If a son hurts his father and his mother

1360
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,840
Or if a father hurts a child

1361
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,940
or the mother hurt the child

1362
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,040
or

1363
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,040
mom hurt dad

1364
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,440
child saw

1365
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,120
In fact, the sentence will be based on

1366
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,960
who is respect and who is sorrow

1367
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,520
to deal with it, right?

1368
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,760
After the Tang Dynasty

1369
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,860
It's actually like this

1370
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,000
Then since the wife is the husband

1371
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
it's his god

1372
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
after the wife passed

1373
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
The most important thing for him is to take this husband's family

1374
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
for his core

1375
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
his main task

1376
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It is said in the so-called ceremony

1377
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Guangsaiji Temple

1378
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
i can't find much

1379
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The picture of Guangji Temple is difficult to draw here

1380
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
but anyway

1381
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
You can watch the cooking

1382
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
This is a planing plan

1383
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
This is a hot chicken picture

1384
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
This is a Buddhist Nine Pose Mother

1385
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Guizi mother has many children and grandchildren

1386
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Then this is a picture of casting Buddha and praying for four horses

1387
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
mainly just to tell you

1388
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
wife if married

1389
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
a woman married like this

1390
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,400
After the husband's house, he takes his family as the core

1391
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,560
The whole point of his family is to

1392
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,000
Responsible for three meals and sacrificial offerings. Roast pigs, cattle and sheep. Roast duck and fish for three meals.

1393
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,800
Then the other thing is to have more sons for him

1394
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,600
so that the family can continue

1395
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,800
In this case, the sacrifice of the good man

1396
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,600
If it is according to the martial arts disciples of this sect, as we just said,

1397
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,400
Even if a loved one dies

1398
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,600
your significant other your husband died

1399
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,600
This is what Yuan Chuntuo said about the half body request

1400
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,800
Half of my body should have collapsed

1401
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,400
That kind of context is right

1402
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,000
But if we look at other documents that were actually unearthed at that time

1403
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,200
You'll find that actually in what we've seen

1404
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,800
Except that Mu Ziming of Yuan Chuntuo saw him at home

1405
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,800
We can see it in many other unearthed materials

1406
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,000
Once the husband dies, the wife or the case

1407
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,400
The case of Zou Yanshu is

1408
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,200
A wife when her husband is watching for her husband

1409
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
next to that hand with another man

1410
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
someone fucked

1411
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,800
It was discovered by my mother-in-law

1412
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,300
This is all dug out Jane

1413
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,000
We didn't know there was such a story before.

1414
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I don't know if it's love or a story from Han Dynasty

1415
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
so what

1416
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,300
As for the mother-in-law, she will sue the officer

1417
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,400
Then a group of officials

1418
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,900
Then start judging this

1419
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,300
widow's punishment

1420
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,100
I always said how to beat him

1421
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,900
how to shut him

1422
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,900
What about various prison sentences?

1423
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,800
Corporal punishment, wait

1424
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,000
There are various discussions

1425
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,600
When it's almost time to test

1426
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,800
Suddenly there is an official who did not attend

1427
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,100
back from business trip

1428
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,600
Tell me which case you are discussing

1429
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,600
I will also participate

1430
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,300
after participating in the discussion

1431
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,500
the official said

1432
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,600
When alive, two are one

1433
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,000
when dead

1434
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
According to our Han out

1435
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,500
Is this love or a legal order from Han?

1436
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,600
dead and gone

1437
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,700
Can't handle it anymore

1438
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,300
So what about this lady

1439
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,000
she only

1440
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,300
if you want to find her check

1441
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,500
If you want to report her for any crime

1442
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,900
It can only be said that she is not satisfied with closing the curtain.

1443
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,400
No respect for this hand hurt venue

1444
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,700
you can't use adultery

1445
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,200
because it's the same way as adultery

1446
00:49:59,200 --> 00:49:59,800
to judge her

1447
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,600
The mother-in-law is very angry. When the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law hold hands together

1448
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,600
The mother-in-law suddenly found out that the daughter-in-law was with someone else

1449
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,100
Linjiu's backside is messing around

1450
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,700
So I took her to the police

1451
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,600
What about the result? The result of the discussion later

1452
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,300
It was the official who obeyed

1453
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,700
According to a legal judgment at the time when the situation was still in Han Dynasty

1454
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,600
I think that when a man is alive is after his wife dies

1455
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,000
just people who don't matter

1456
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,200
So mother-in-law is not eligible

1457
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't have the capacity to sue this daughter-in-law

1458
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,300
This is the most recent colleague of ours is the academician of Industry Field

1459
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,300
I just did some research and found out that there is such a thing

1460
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,700
Then the other one is

1461
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,600
In 2006, it was discovered in 2006 that the park had been built for 20 years.

1462
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,900
That's household registration

1463
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,900
it's also late

1464
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:42,700
Only friends of academic level can do the research

1465
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,500
found out that the girl got married

1466
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,200
if after death

1467
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,900
He won't stay at her husband's house either

1468
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,900
He went back to his mother's house

1469
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,500
And no longer bear the husband's surname

1470
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,200
restore his original natal status.

1471
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,000
Just live with my mother's family

1472
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,900
why would you know

1473
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Because the urgent obstacle is the transfer registration of household registration

1474
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
we found out like this

1475
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
a custom of

1476
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,300
so it can be seen

1477
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,200
In fact, if there is a so-called

1478
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Well

1479
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,900
what i just said

1480
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,100
Wufu's set

1481
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,100
In the Tang Dynasty, it was indeed

1482
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,100
in law

1483
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,200
laid down

1484
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,600
But in this process, there are five blessings

1485
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,800
The Five Blessings

1486
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,900
During the Tang Dynasty

1487
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,900
Although I just said

1488
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,400
forgot to say this

1489
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,100
267 years

1490
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,300
I already said when I got in

1491
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,900
In the future, the Five Blessings must be approved to rule the law

1492
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,100
is to be stipulated in this way

1493
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,100
So in the Tang Dynasty

1494
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,900
Only then can we really write the meaning of Tang Law's calligraphy

1495
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,200
But from 267 to the establishment of the Tang Dynasty in the seventh century

1496
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,400
During these four hundred years

1497
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,700
In fact, we have seen in many other materials

1498
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,800
Wufu can't help

1499
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,400
really into the law

1500
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,300
people's living habits

1501
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,900
In fact, with his mother's family

1502
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,800
Girls usually

1503
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,300
maintains a fairly close relationship with his natal family

1504
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,700
and legally

1505
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,100
won't last forever

1506
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,400
so-called concubine

1507
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,800
or the husband died

1508
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,900
must be consistent

1509
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,800
this kind of attitude

1510
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,000
In fact, in the data we have seen

1511
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:58,900
are very few

1512
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,800
on the other hand

1513
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
you can see

1514
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
inside the business suit

1515
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,500
It's also very clear, didn't we just talk about it?

1516
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
if one knows oneself

1517
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
only know my mother

1518
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,800
don't know my father

1519
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,700
actually not

1520
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,600
Because this whole uniform

1521
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,000
It's all about the father

1522
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,300
to regulate

1523
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,000
What about when the law decides a case?

1524
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,300
In fact, the whole process

1525
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
From the business service to the Tang Dynasty

1526
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,500
determined in the middle

1527
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,800
There are many different cases

1528
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
have been through debates and quarrels

1529
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:22,800
dispute

1530
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,400
one of them was a

1531
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,600
what i just said

1532
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,100
when a son finds his mother

1533
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,900
killed his dad

1534
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,400
if this is the case

1535
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,400
Does the son need to sue the police?

1536
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,200
According to the Confucianism of the time

1537
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,800
influenced by Confucianism

1538
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
the influence of these

1539
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,200
official statement

1540
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,200
must be sued

1541
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,200
because dad is your king

1542
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,300
Although mother is your dearest relative

1543
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,800
if you sue

1544
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,300
ok

1545
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,300
couple

1546
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,900
my parents domestic violence

1547
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,600
beated

1548
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,800
fight

1549
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,600
beat to a degree

1550
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,300
mom can't stand it

1551
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,700
dad killed

1552
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,900
son saw with his own eyes

1553
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,500
Should my son go at this time?

1554
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,500
sue the officer

1555
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It was an issue they were debating

1556
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
influenced by Confucianism

1557
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Or officials who believe in military uniforms say

1558
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Of course you should sue the officer

1559
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Because your Supreme has been killed

1560
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
How can you keep silent

1561
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
But officials who don't believe in this set think that

1562
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
mother is your close relative

1563
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You saw him kill your Supreme

1564
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You go to report on your next of kin again

1565
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
In the end your next of kin were killed

1566
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
was seized by the government

1567
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
and then sentenced to death

1568
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So didn't you kill your loved ones?

1569
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
so there's no way to tell

1570
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
this can't be sued

1571
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
what to do

1572
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Both sides are officials for the benefit of this law

1573
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Should I sue

1574
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
sparked debate

1575
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
was debating the sixth century

1576
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
while still debating

1577
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
an official said

1578
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
of course to sue

1579
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Because the House of Elishang has already said

1580
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
know mother but not father

1581
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The savages are easy to enjoy

1582
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It's the so-called resistance

1583
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
What does it mean to block

1584
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Mavericks

1585
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Do calves and cows have a deep love?

1586
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Resisting affection is the meaning of affection

1587
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah

1588
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Clam

1589
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,400
if you only knew cows

1590
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,200
you only know cows

1591
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,200
don't know bull

1592
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,400
Then you are a beast

1593
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,300
For all the beasts know

1594
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:09,400
love my mother

1595
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,800
Only civilized animals like humans

1596
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,200
I learned to respect my father

1597
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,000
So if you only know how to love your mother

1598
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,500
I don't know how to respect my father

1599
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,900
Shibi Savage

1600
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,800
Exotic Beasts

1601
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,500
Your morality is at the level of animals

1602
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,600
almost

1603
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,800
That another official is objecting

1604
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,500
the official said

1605
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,800
this is no way to accept

1606
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,200
This way of talking is unacceptable

1607
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Why

1608
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,000
only with parents

1609
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,200
born of the same breath

1610
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,900
Zhong Tian Mi repays love in the wild

1611
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,700
The love for parents should be the same

1612
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,300
exclamation on its dignity

1613
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,400
change its pros and cons

1614
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,500
Why do you suddenly say that the father respects the mother?

1615
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,700
Parents are good and mothers are bad

1616
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,800
If the mother kills the father

1617
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,600
must sue

1618
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,700
If the father kills the mother without suing

1619
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,700
Mother should not sue father for killing father

1620
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,800
so suddenly

1621
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,100
push salary

1622
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,300
anti ancient fearless

1623
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,400
In fact, he said that anti-ancient fearlessness is wrong.

1624
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,100
Because Anti-Ancient is fearful

1625
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,000
Because Yili Shangfu is clearly like this

1626
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But don't believe this

1627
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And think mother and father

1628
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
In fact, they are all the same breath

1629
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
born together

1630
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Such an official cannot accept

1631
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So the law didn't change

1632
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That is to say, the father killed the mother

1633
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Like discovering a domestic violence case at home

1634
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
no son

1635
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I can't bear it

1636
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
can't do it

1637
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So everyone can guess

1638
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Domestic violence cases at that time probably had no solution

1639
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
appeared

1640
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
it just won't work

1641
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Because basically the law can't bear it

1642
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Tell this kid to sue

1643
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
any father or mother

1644
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
This is because of my mother

1645
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
love and kindness between mother and child

1646
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
challenged

1647
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It turns out we were just

1648
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The whole set of Eli Sanford

1649
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
in this day and age

1650
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
In fact, there are many, many

1651
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
amendments to laws

1652
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
for example

1653
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
tree is a person

1654
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
weak child

1655
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
if he be his father's heir

1656
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The so-called son of the tree is the queen of the father

1657
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
That is, if a boy

1658
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
became the father's heir

1659
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It's just that his father didn't

1660
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
During the first period, no children were born

1661
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
All that was born of him

1662
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
later became

1663
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
heir

1664
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,500
Then according to the regulations of business clothes with etiquette, that is to say

1665
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,300
If the number of sons is the father

1666
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,700
The son of the concubine became the heir of the father

1667
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,700
to himself the mother who bore him

1668
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,700
Because that mother is a concubine, right?

1669
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,700
Isn't it the real wife?

1670
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,900
nothing to wear

1671
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,400
wear very very light

1672
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,900
It seems that I haven't taken it or take it for three months

1673
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,300
but in this era

1674
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,200
As far as we are talking about the era of Yuan Cuntuo

1675
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,700
Because many sons are reluctant to part with their mothers

1676
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:25,700
Since my concubine uncle gave birth to my good son

1677
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,100
I managed to become my father's heir

1678
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,900
How could I not honor my own mother

1679
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,300
so when my mother died

1680
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,700
Although he is a concubine

1681
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,100
I still take a heavy wound for him

1682
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,500
It's like he's my aunt

1683
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,300
many people like this

1684
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,500
After many sons do this

1685
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,700
Later the law was changed

1686
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,600
just accept

1687
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,800
Counting sons as fathers and then mothers

1688
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,600
It's the mother who is the concubine

1689
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,000
can also take serious injuries

1690
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,200
besides

1691
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,000
If according to the ethics of the patrilineal family

1692
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,100
son

1693
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,200
one who gave birth to a son

1694
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,600
even the main wife

1695
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,500
once his husband died

1696
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
he becomes a widow

1697
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,200
If a widow remarries into another family

1698
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,600
people

1699
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,000
As far as my family is concerned

1700
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,500
well done

1701
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,560
In terms of original depository, shepherds

1702
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,460
already another

1703
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,500
completely other people

1704
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,160
It has nothing to do with my family

1705
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,160
so what

1706
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,300
The child born in the original home

1707
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,860
Once my widowed mother goes out

1708
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,860
marry someone else

1709
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,900
after she died there

1710
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,100
I will not mourn her

1711
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,960
This is stipulated under Yishangfu

1712
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,700
But in the age we're talking about

1713
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,200
These sons are reluctant

1714
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,260
It's her parent-child relationship

1715
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,760
You'll know it after watching Yuan Cun Tuo Muzhi

1716
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,900
even if widowed

1717
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,660
There is contact with the original child

1718
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:30,660
if there is contact

1719
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,880
when you dress according to etiquette

1720
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,780
you are not allowed to mourn

1721
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,780
Knowing that the mother who gave birth to me died

1722
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,980
died elsewhere

1723
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,080
I still can't help it

1724
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,380
So there are a lot of people in mourning

1725
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,280
something happened

1726
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,480
Later the law was changed

1727
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,380
acceptable

1728
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,380
can mourn

1729
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,380
besides

1730
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,980
stepfather

1731
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,020
according to etiquette

1732
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,080
This question of the Supreme Father seems to be

1733
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,320
stepfather

1734
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,480
people who don't matter at all

1735
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,720
because that's sex

1736
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,120
It's not that I don't believe it

1737
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,880
I don't believe in pastoralism

1738
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,160
neither believe in pastor nor practice

1739
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,080
right

1740
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,080
But

1741
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,600
It is because we look at the example of Yuan Chuntuo

1742
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,100
Of course there are many other examples

1743
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,500
I just use Yuanchunto to make a shadow

1744
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,500
you will know

1745
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,700
Brothers and sisters between the same mother and adoptive father at that time

1746
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,300
may be related is related

1747
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,800
not unrelated

1748
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,400
then if at the time of death

1749
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,300
Originally, I was dissatisfied with the business clothes with etiquette

1750
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,000
But they all

1751
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,600
A lot of people are supervising doctors, too.

1752
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,900
The royal family is fine, the royal family is fine

1753
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,600
Supervisor

1754
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,200
result to the end

1755
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,100
the law was changed

1756
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,600
so that they can mourn each other

1757
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,500
There is also the so-called

1758
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,800
nephew mourning for mother

1759
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,900
Mujiu is mother's brother

1760
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It's actually another family.

1761
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
He's different from me

1762
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,200
the same reason

1763
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,400
in other words

1764
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,800
Because of this mother

1765
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,100
contacted a lot of original

1766
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,500
Looks like it's in the patrilineal family

1767
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,700
ok person

1768
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,800
And these people who don't matter

1769
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,900
become related to each other

1770
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,400
This is in our section

1771
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,800
the study of legal history

1772
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,900
Research done by scholars later found that

1773
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,300
Because of the kindness of mother and son

1774
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,800
Patriarchy

1775
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,400
and modified the then

1776
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,300
etiquette and law

1777
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,300
Mother

1778
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,300
really the importance

1779
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,240
The so-called king of Xihe did not sleep

1780
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,400
Mrs. Grandson of the Beginning of Vision

1781
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,540
sons and parents have different habits

1782
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,140
so to speak

1783
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:12,680
daughter is still

1784
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,980
son to parents

1785
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,440
It's homosexuality

1786
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,880
no way to call him

1787
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,240
Then of course the daughter has no way to ask him to share.

1788
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,180
what about this era

1789
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,280
In fact, when we look at it this way, we find that

1790
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,680
Fertility is the matter of giving birth to a child and being a mother

1791
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:27,780
indeed in this one

1792
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:31,020
In the age of the Middle Ages we are talking about

1793
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,460
on this reproductive culture

1794
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,560
There is a step forward

1795
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,780
how to say

1796
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:38,780
in the fifth century

1797
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,460
It is about a hundred years earlier than this Yuanchuntuo Belt

1798
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,060
There is a book called Xiaopin Fang

1799
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,060
There used to be a saying in Xiaopinfang called

1800
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,560
Going to the ground to make grass is as old as dead

1801
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,860
What's the meaning

1802
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,660
we were

1803
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,660
When I read this sentence

1804
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,460
I can't read it

1805
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,960
Why is it called childbirth?

1806
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,020
call down the ground to make grass

1807
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,100
Wonderful

1808
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:00,100
The spirit is born on the ground and the law is like the old dead

1809
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
when this woman is about to give birth

1810
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,500
to get down to the ground and sit on the grass

1811
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,500
like waiting to die

1812
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,500
Because it is actually very dangerous to produce

1813
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,500
like waiting to die

1814
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,000
But why is it called the grass under the ground?

1815
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I for this reason

1816
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
read this thing

1817
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,000
feel very curious

1818
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,500
to check all kinds of information

1819
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,500
it turns out

1820
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,500
these are western

1821
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,500
Here is a Japanese

1822
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,500
you will find

1823
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,500
I used to have a baby

1824
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
It's not the same as what you see now

1825
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,500
still the same

1826
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Now it's old again

1827
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
use now

1828
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,500
Again in this vertical way

1829
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,500
giving birth

1830
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,500
This is a Greek peach

1831
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
look at the people behind

1832
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,500
prop up his cutting nest

1833
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,500
there is a child here

1834
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,500
about to fall

1835
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
This is a Roman relief

1836
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,500
look at

1837
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
there is a person here

1838
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
prop up his cutting nest

1839
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,500
Then he put his hand here

1840
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,500
ready to pick up the baby

1841
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,500
this roman relief

1842
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,500
and then this is

1843
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,500
14th century England

1844
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,500
Right, Mr. Shen

1845
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,500
A Miserable Woman's Handbook in England

1846
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,500
You can take a look

1847
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
here is a rope

1848
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Then someone fell

1849
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,500
pull the rope

1850
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,500
This man is teaching him how to push hard

1851
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,240
If the child in your stomach

1852
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,440
if this shape

1853
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,640
That's natural birth, right?

1854
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,600
It should be born smoothly, right?

1855
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,380
if like other olympics

1856
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,980
Olympic gymnasts

1857
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,180
Posture words

1858
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:16,740
that's probably

1859
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,980
Difficult

1860
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,980
unlikely to survive

1861
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,480
But in this wave shoveling manual, he will be taught

1862
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,980
how do you make it smooth

1863
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,480
even a child in the belly

1864
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,180
Is it the hands on top, the head on top, or where are the feet?

1865
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,660
how to massage your belly

1866
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,660
how to go around

1867
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,120
There is still a way to get this kid

1868
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,760
turn into this

1869
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,620
Then let the child be born smoothly

1870
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,220
Then look again

1871
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,420
this his pose

1872
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,560
he's not lying in bed

1873
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,660
he is standing he is sitting

1874
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,960
he is standing with standing

1875
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,840
Again, this is an Arabic manuscript from the 14th century

1876
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,100
manuscript look

1877
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,040
Same thing, hold up his pigeon spider

1878
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,640
the way he sits

1879
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,500
find a way to get the child

1880
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,840
Mr. that is in another room

1881
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,640
Very nervous, I can't tell

1882
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,540
but anyway

1883
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,140
He is a vertical product

1884
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,180
this is safe

1885
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,260
Shin'an Dynasty's Japan

1886
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,360
Inside of a demonic ultra near the twelfth century

1887
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,400
you can see

1888
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,480
This man is having a baby

1889
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,400
The devil is waiting here

1890
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,800
If someone dies hard to hide

1891
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,120
This evil spirit can come to the mad ghost

1892
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,680
then something to eat

1893
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,680
the point is not it

1894
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,180
Although this is a Buddhist saying

1895
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,440
but what am I interested in when I see

1896
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,580
it's time for this person to give birth

1897
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,780
he didn't lie flat

1898
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,380
Someone behind him is supporting his den

1899
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:24,180
Someone in front is going to give birth to the next child

1900
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,520
This is the so-called grass

1901
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,660
When people used to give birth

1902
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,420
The era that we originally lived in

1903
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,960
I found out that it was written in the art

1904
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,400
You don't lie flat when you're about to have a baby

1905
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,900
It is a vertical production experience

1906
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,400
Then we continue to find all kinds of information

1907
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,540
vertical production experience

1908
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,540
Indeed many civilizations

1909
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,740
ancient and modern

1910
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,100
Except by

1911
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,140
It is the ancient Chinese and foreign

1912
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,480
You can find such a vertical production experience

1913
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,020
This one is from the fourteenth century

1914
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,080
Vienna Herbs Inside

1915
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:56,980
you can see

1916
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,580
Someone behind him is supporting his den

1917
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,100
to squat vertically

1918
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,320
half done pose

1919
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,760
There's another woman here

1920
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,760
Holding the medicine is like making medicine and stuffing it in

1921
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,440
Let her skid smoothly

1922
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,320
give birth quickly

1923
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:08,960
so what

1924
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,840
we can discover the whole process of being a mother

1925
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,920
It turned out that no one actually studied it.

1926
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,080
Because children have been born by women until now

1927
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:18,920
right

1928
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,840
Has a man ever given birth?

1929
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:21,320
Except Arnold Schwarzenegger

1930
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,520
people about my age

1931
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,760
Should have seen Arnold Schwarzenegger have a baby

1932
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:25,960
I am now in class if I say

1933
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,760
arnold schwarzenegger

1934
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,240
they say the governor of california

1935
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,360
child retired who

1936
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,720
actually not

1937
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,160
women are giving birth

1938
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,720
Because women give birth

1939
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,200
so no history

1940
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,600
historical research is

1941
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,840
Confucianism is the study of normal and unchanging things

1942
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,800
normal stuff

1943
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,000
often

1944
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,920
History is interested in change

1945
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,880
something changed

1946
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,440
we have

1947
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,480
Only historians are interested

1948
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,520
This is from Sima Qian

1949
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,360
That's what our Master Master said at the beginning

1950
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,760
What did Sima Qian say?

1951
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,760
Through the ancient scriptures

1952
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,840
On the occasion of salvation

1953
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,520
some are gods

1954
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,000
some are

1955
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
the boundary between man and sky

1956
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Historians need to find it out

1957
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
If it is a matter of God, for example

1958
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
It's God's business for a woman to have a baby

1959
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
No man has children

1960
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
So this is not a human thing

1961
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
women give birth

1962
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
But what is the human part?

1963
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
how do women give birth

1964
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
there may be changes, right?

1965
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
It's a day for a woman to give birth

1966
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It may still be days until now

1967
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Although in the 1970s

1968
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
even earlier in the 60s

1969
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
when women exercise

1970
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
There was hope to use that artificial sub-worker

1971
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
put it over there

1972
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Then after conceiving in it,

1973
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
let him take the child

1974
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
It can come out like this

1975
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But so far no success

1976
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Even as a surrogate mother

1977
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
or women give birth

1978
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Alright, between heaven and man

1979
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
There is a divide between heaven and man

1980
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Historians must first understand

1981
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
what are the gods

1982
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
we don't have to touch

1983
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
because it doesn't change

1984
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
are certain

1985
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
common sense

1986
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
what are human things

1987
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It's how a woman lives

1988
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
This matter may be subject to change

1989
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Tai Shigong said

1990
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,140
When historians are looking for heaven and man

1991
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,180
What about the human part?

1992
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,580
Changes through the ancient scriptures

1993
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,680
you look early

1994
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,280
How to give birth in ancient times

1995
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,720
How to give birth in modern times

1996
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,480
You compare ancient childbirth with modern childbirth

1997
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,820
make him this change, figure it out

1998
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,520
then write it out

1999
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,760
It's called the words of a family

2000
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:20,720
what historians do is

2001
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,020
On the occasion of salvation

2002
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,700
Changes through the ancient scriptures

2003
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,860
Then after writing out

2004
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,900
into a family

2005
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,800
Maybe someone ignores you and doesn't believe what you say

2006
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,300
It's okay, this is my family

2007
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,100
what about family talk

2008
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,340
Descendents of Changzhu Minshan

2009
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,840
someone will find out later

2010
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,140
These people are waiting for me

2011
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,280
That is to say

2012
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,580
They have put this information

2013
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,180
I don't know it's been two thousand years

2014
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,620
no one ever noticed

2015
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,780
Going down to the ground to practice grass is like saving lives

2016
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,020
I watched Yuan Chuntuo

2017
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:47,160
Such a close relationship with his parents and children

2018
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,060
The role of this mother is so important

2019
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:50,660
But no one has studied

2020
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:52,860
When I was interviewing at Dr. Luo

2021
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,300
I was doing legal history at that time

2022
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,700
Just said the first paragraph

2023
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,400
All are fragrant and fragrant

2024
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,300
hit a ball

2025
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,400
The oral examination committee said

2026
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,400
every time a woman wants to live

2027
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,240
why is it bloody

2028
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,940
They're all murderers?

2029
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:07,540
Women are not the most important vocation

2030
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:08,840
Is it just to have a baby?

2031
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,140
why nothing good

2032
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,340
Whatever the relationship between husband and wife

2033
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,140
These things are in your thesis

2034
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,040
At that time, of course I had to graduate in order to get a Ph.D.

2035
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,240
I say because of art

2036
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,480
Because there is no data to study

2037
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,480
So we didn't study it

2038
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,480
That's because there is a new Zhangjiashan Han sister

2039
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,080
the master check out

2040
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,380
So let's look at it from a legal point of view

2041
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,280
then they all listen to me

2042
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,720
Just let me get my doctorate and come back

2043
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,120
is working with

2044
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,520
But when I came back, I found out

2045
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,420
In fact, there is no information

2046
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,420
because we have no gender awareness

2047
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,260
That is, when we are doing medical history research,

2048
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,860
Didn't think of thinking about medical history from a woman's perspective

2049
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:45,060
Our previous medical history research was basically

2050
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,560
civilian medical research

2051
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,060
Emperor or Democracy Studies

2052
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,500
Emperor Neijing Shennong Materia Medica

2053
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,440
all the way down

2054
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,240
Then go to Li Shizhen Materia Medica Gangmu

2055
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,940
who is modern now

2056
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:55,640
Otherwise, it's not civilian medicine, it's democracy

2057
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,740
Otherwise, it is the legend of the great man

2058
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,300
Otherwise it is the history of progress

2059
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,940
It's just been making great progress

2060
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,400
More and more progress, and finally today

2061
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,400
How our medicine prospers

2062
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,800
Without the perspective of the recipient being the user

2063
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,700
especially not writing medical books

2064
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,900
but was taken care of by medical books

2065
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,500
or being taken care of by others

2066
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:15,100
or someone else who acts as a caregiver

2067
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,000
The kind that does not enter medical books

2068
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,300
pure woman

2069
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,600
Women participate in birth, aging, sickness and death health care

2070
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:23,500
really everywhere

2071
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,800
But because of our medical history

2072
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,000
no such consciousness

2073
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,800
So don't do this kind of research

2074
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Going to the ground to make grass is as old as dead

2075
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,100
such a sentence

2076
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,600
has been around since the fifth century

2077
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,800
No one studied it in 1500

2078
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,600
I found it very strange when I saw it

2079
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,500
I want to know what it means

2080
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,300
found out

2081
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,100
In fact, there are all kinds of ancient and modern Chinese and foreign

2082
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:43,400
Images of this type tell us

2083
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,000
previous production pose

2084
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,700
is a vertical production position

2085
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,800
besides the person born because of this

2086
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,600
other people supporting him

2087
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,100
is very very important

2088
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,200
I am due to time today

2089
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,500
show you pictures

2090
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,000
In fact, there are such explanations in medical books.

2091
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,800
It's the so-called refusal of female parents

2092
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,000
When you are about to give birth, there are many

2093
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
One wants to help him hold a pig

2094
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
one to help him tie his hair

2095
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
one to help him

2096
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
if passed out

2097
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I still have to struggle with him

2098
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Spray him with water

2099
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
splash him wake him up

2100
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
There are various

2101
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
there will be many different women

2102
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
while helping a woman

2103
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
give birth to a child

2104
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And this woman who is about to give birth

2105
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
won't lie on a boat

2106
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Let the doctor see him and give him a finger

2107
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
or open two fingers

2108
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
or open three fingers

2109
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
he will walk around

2110
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
because he figured out

2111
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Make it easier for the child to get down

2112
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So I will keep walking in the room

2113
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Then he keeps walking through the room

2114
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
The people next to him have been following him around like this.

2115
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
So the health care provider

2116
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,000
or maternity caregiver

2117
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
or married woman

2118
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
or live-in

2119
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
In fact, the person born with

2120
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
is one

2121
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Physical labor

2122
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
find a way to give birth to a child

2123
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
stay with us

2124
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
late twentieth century

2125
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Later in France

2126
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
this scene

2127
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
It's actually a bit like

2128
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
but we

2129
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
not in our impression

2130
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
if you ask me today

2131
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
impression of having a baby

2132
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
you wouldn't think

2133
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
A photo like this, right?

2134
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
because we have entered into

2135
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
after modern

2136
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
all lying in the hospital

2137
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
let the doctor

2138
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
the height of that bed

2139
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
almost

2140
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The height of the doctor's convenience

2141
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
You won't come down casually

2142
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,500
If it hurts and you can't give birth

2143
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,500
That might be the mother-in-law

2144
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,500
mother-in-law to a degree

2145
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,000
In fact, people have

2146
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
born this person

2147
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
no longer conscious

2148
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Actually I have a lot

2149
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
some friends were born by in-laws

2150
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
after birth

2151
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,500
He said he didn't remember at all

2152
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
The moment he suddenly became a mother

2153
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,000
he has no impression

2154
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
feel very sad

2155
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
of course of course

2156
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
want this myself

2157
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
consciously say

2158
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I suddenly become a mother

2159
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
the pain is severe

2160
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
when i was in class

2161
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
will tell the students

2162
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
go back and ask mom

2163
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
How painful was that time

2164
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
squatting or squatting

2165
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
still sitting

2166
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
how much pain

2167
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,500
But my students come back

2168
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,000
Most of the answers are

2169
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Mom said it hurts to give birth to you

2170
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
not as good as later

2171
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
come to hurt my heart

2172
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Then there's no way

2173
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,500
this totally leaves

2174
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,500
my original topic

2175
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,500
but anyway

2176
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,500
you can know

2177
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,500
This form of production

2178
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,000
In fact, it was like this in ancient times

2179
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
in the middle of the twentieth century

2180
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Because the whole world is the same

2181
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,500
the relationship of scientism

2182
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,500
Make the mother-in-law's birth rate too high, too high

2183
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,000
So the French obstetrician

2184
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,500
This is a French obstetrician

2185
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,000
decided to

2186
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
nostalgia

2187
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,960
Get inspired by historical plot databases

2188
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,400
How to help women who come to his clinic to give birth

2189
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,000
It is possible to have an experience of the process of being a mother

2190
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
if they want

2191
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,560
If you are not in good health, of course you can't try it casually

2192
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,560
sometimes it's dangerous

2193
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,560
It's really dangerous

2194
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,560
not without danger

2195
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,000
But if you still can

2196
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,760
she will have a husband by her side

2197
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,840
licensed nurse

2198
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,960
plus this obstetrician

2199
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,560
help this maternity

2200
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,960
Use the Vertical Production Position

2201
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,920
Bone Fang left the little ones

2202
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,320
What about her way of life?

2203
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,320
After I came out, I was actually challenging the time

2204
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,320
France or Europe

2205
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,920
In fact, or around the world in the 1970s

2206
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,520
This kind of mother-in-law birth rate is very, very high

2207
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,720
The custom of letting Qi intervene in the female body

2208
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,400
So some obstetricians were very upset about her

2209
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,920
I think she's blocking people's money.

2210
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,120
because if you give birth

2211
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,000
In the early stage, there were indeed more

2212
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,120
What's more, she said that when you give birth there, it's a normal delivery.

2213
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,720
That's why we can use the vertical production position you just mentioned

2214
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,960
It is even more impossible if the childbirth is reversed

2215
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,300
Then this doctor Michel Auden said

2216
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,700
No I also have a buttock on my side

2217
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,700
If you look at it today, of course it's counterproductive.

2218
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:09,500
It's not normal. The butt comes out first.

2219
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,100
But if you're willing to massage it slowly

2220
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:16,400
In fact, this child is still born naturally or stretched out

2221
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,200
As far as the buttocks are still stretched out like this

2222
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,000
So you know that in this context

2223
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,200
A resident is actually very, very important

2224
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,500
Not only those doctors who write medical books are important

2225
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
The whole process of getting a woman to be a mother

2226
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,500
In addition to the fact that this person is very important

2227
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,000
The person next to you is very important

2228
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
This is the picture on the poster and the cover of my book

2229
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
It is because after I read these books

2230
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,300
I did research and I found

2231
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,200
This is really a big family from Sichuan

2232
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,200
A moment for parents to pay attention to men's repayment

2233
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
you can see

2234
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,900
Here is a woman in a vertical birth position

2235
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,200
Someone behind him supports his height

2236
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,500
Someone up front donated their sleeves

2237
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,700
give birth to him

2238
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:56,900
Who is this next to you?

2239
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,700
Since the Buddha said that parents should pay attention to men

2240
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,460
Of course, if this is the mother, then this is the father.

2241
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,960
This is definitely not an obstetrician

2242
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,260
not an obstetrician

2243
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,100
this is father

2244
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:08,240
But this father is very interesting

2245
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:11,340
He's holding something like a test, like a book

2246
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:13,140
In fact, this is a very good explanation

2247
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:15,040
Framing of our later study in the medical room

2248
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,440
from the perspective of your culture of birth

2249
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,880
Let's see how to have a baby

2250
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,280
Then give birth to a female tetrasomy

2251
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:22,800
is to help each other

2252
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,480
Born and cared for Helping people take care of each other

2253
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,580
give birth to the child

2254
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:30,180
Rather, these things are actually in medical books.

2255
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,080
There is a different way of saying

2256
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,580
Just this man next to him is a father figure

2257
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,580
If he is in courteous clothing

2258
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,580
It's a very important role, right?

2259
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,380
But here he is taking a book and saying

2260
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,580
Listen to me, he's still anxious

2261
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,880
Because he's going to be a father

2262
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,980
But what about these three people?

2263
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,680
I don't have time for him

2264
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,780
They worked so hard to get this baby born

2265
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,580
And where does his authority come from?

2266
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:52,380
not from his hands

2267
01:12:52,380 --> 01:12:54,180
but in his hand

2268
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,880
something like a book comes

2269
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,880
What does that mean

2270
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,880
In fact, in medical books

2271
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,880
very much recorded

2272
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,800
How do you feel about having a baby?

2273
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,000
in what i do we just talk

2274
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,400
Yuan Cuntuo is the age of Yuan Cuntuo

2275
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,400
The matter of childbirth is gradually being treated by doctors

2276
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,500
full involvement

2277
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,900
before Yuan Cuntuo

2278
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,600
It's the Han Dynasty or earlier

2279
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,500
we see occasionally

2280
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,600
Medical books will appear related to childbirth

2281
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,100
Mostly after pregnancy

2282
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,400
or after birth

2283
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,600
Afraid of dystocia or poor health after giving birth

2284
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,600
how to take care of

2285
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,000
But in the fifth to seventh centuries

2286
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,600
This is the era of Yuan Cuntuo

2287
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,600
It’s the era I’m working on, and the problem hasn’t been explained yet.

2288
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,200
The doctor gradually began to write from the time of seeking a child

2289
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,200
That is, we want to be able to know

2290
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,500
how can i get pregnant

2291
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,200
So there are all kinds of suitors

2292
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,500
And earlier, the begging party

2293
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,500
They are basically in the middle of the room

2294
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,400
Just use the book in the room

2295
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,200
That is, a man who wants to have a child

2296
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,400
have son temple

2297
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,000
Then you know the room

2298
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,600
The truth of the time period is happy at the same time

2299
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,400
There is a son who thinks he is good and old, Shou Ye

2300
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,100
Memorize the secrets of childbearing

2301
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,700
words in the book in the room

2302
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,600
When you have sex you want to make your partner wife happy

2303
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,300
You are only happy when she is happy, you don’t want to live your own happiness

2304
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,600
If you only want to be happy, you will not be able to have a good son

2305
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,300
The principle of the time period is happy at the same time, follow her principle

2306
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:14,500
She thinks the reason is up, the time is up, then follow her reason

2307
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,300
Happy at the same time, she is happy, so are you

2308
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:20,600
What will happen in the end?

2309
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:26,300
Having a son will be capable, kind, and live a long life

2310
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,600
This is in the book in the room

2311
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,700
Who are the default readers of the book in the room? They are basically men

2312
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,700
Because he is the truth of the world, she told you to do this

2313
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,800
Only your partner can give birth to a good son for you

2314
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,000
The ball pointers we saw before the fifth century were basically of this type

2315
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
But after the seventh century we discovered

2316
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,700
between the fifth and seventh centuries

2317
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,700
There are a lot of ball pointers that are late for wives

2318
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,100
late for women

2319
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,800
Qianjin Fang Sun Simiao is a great doctor

2320
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,300
Inside the Thousand Gold Prescription of Sun Simiao, a great doctor in the Tang Dynasty

2321
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,500
The first volume in the front is about accumulating energy, which is about the basic principles

2322
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,200
From the beginning of the second volume, all ball fingers

2323
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,800
What should I eat? In fact, there are some medicines in it.

2324
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,120
It used to be medicine for sheep in Fangzhong

2325
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,800
But now I put it in the woman's ball medicine to eat

2326
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,000
That is to say, a woman can be a mother

2327
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,520
Concubine or a legitimate wife

2328
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,880
The role of the aunt

2329
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,000
It is very, very important in this society of aristocratic families

2330
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,520
you can see

2331
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,520
These sides of the ball

2332
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,120
Doctors also started to enter

2333
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,600
The woman in the medical book gradually became complete

2334
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,200
Not only after having a baby or getting pregnant

2335
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,120
itch

2336
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,800
tickle or

2337
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,280
Itchy babies, these

2338
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,720
but from the beginning

2339
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,000
Ask for a pregnancy and a child and ask for a man

2340
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,120
Asking for pregnancy is a son's business

2341
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,960
It also appeared in medical books this year

2342
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,960
So the woman party becomes an independent party

2343
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,200
and born from conception

2344
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,040
How to fine tune after giving birth

2345
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,120
Make his menstruation normal

2346
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:55,320
Then the whole body can be born again

2347
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,800
this set of ideas

2348
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,000
It began to develop from the fifth century to the first book in China in the thirteenth century

2349
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
The so-called rehabilitation

2350
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Re-examination book

2351
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
It's the book about independent subjects

2352
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
The two sides of Furen University appeared

2353
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
The way Furen University compares the two parties is

2354
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Golden generation

2355
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
payment in advance

2356
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
set the gold

2357
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
can

2358
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Then the red and white bag is solved so that there is no bad discharge

2359
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
then you can conceive

2360
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
How to give birth to a baby after the pregnancy is over

2361
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Continue to transfer gold after giving birth

2362
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
back again and again

2363
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
A living dragon is wrong because it's about women

2364
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Another female body that can reproduce

2365
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
So the whole set actually starts with

2366
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
The fifth century is what we're doing

2367
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
gradually began to develop

2368
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
life begins to enter

2369
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Come to understand the whole female body

2370
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Then what

2371
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
There are a lot of details in these processes

2372
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I won't talk much because of time constraints

2373
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
including birth

2374
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
how to which direction

2375
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Coating the placenta of the child after delivery

2376
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Where should it be buried?

2377
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
This child's life will not be

2378
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
so it won't break

2379
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Because it was said before that if the placenta is bitten by a dog

2380
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
children may seek death

2381
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I don't know if you guys have heard this kind of story

2382
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
like this

2383
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,600
folk customs

2384
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,840
There are still many

2385
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,840
But what about these things?

2386
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,200
In the past, they all had their own pictures.

2387
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,080
we are in the age of authors

2388
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,480
between the fifth and seventh centuries

2389
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,840
Gradually these pictures

2390
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,080
Including the orientation of raw and the orientation of embedding

2391
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,000
And the location of the delivery room, etc.

2392
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,600
all together

2393
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,560
become dependent

2394
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:19,560
and needs tidying up

2395
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,360
need to know knowledge

2396
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,280
there is

2397
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,160
Where is the blood

2398
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,760
how many months pregnant

2399
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,600
Which blood can't be dregs

2400
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,440
Which blood can't be dregs

2401
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,640
If it is scum, it may be aborted

2402
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,600
Actually in other words

2403
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
if he wants an abortion

2404
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,160
Just fuck that tire, right?

2405
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,680
So there is actually a whole set of knowledge that exists

2406
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,160
just to see who is using

2407
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,880
But mastering the art

2408
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,080
basically male

2409
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,280
what we see now

2410
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,880
The knowledge of art is probably like this

2411
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,480
So around this time

2412
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,640
developed

2413
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:48,640
those tires

2414
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,320
Where are these blood levels?

2415
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,320
with today's

2416
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,640
some may be different

2417
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,640
this of course leave

2418
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,640
what we say

2419
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,760
this part of the birth

2420
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,000
But just go into medical history

2421
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,640
After being challenged by the influence of gender

2422
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,640
actually

2423
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,600
That is to say, the so-called twelve catties of wheat internal organs

2424
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,600
In fact, there is a historical evolution

2425
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,600
not fine

2426
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,000
not forever

2427
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It originally changed from eleven catties to twelve catties

2428
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
how to match

2429
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,600
Then a smell of blood on top

2430
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,800
In fact, there are different changes in different eras

2431
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,200
After using these later found data, we

2432
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,400
Combine it with today's and you'll find

2433
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,400
In fact, these have evolved

2434
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,800
Then we just said

2435
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,800
These require a vertical production

2436
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,700
walking around that room

2437
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:25,700
impossible for him to be alone

2438
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,900
There must be someone nearby to help

2439
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,100
So the caregiver becomes a very important person

2440
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,500
The study of previous medical history

2441
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,300
Basically because it's all great people research

2442
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,100
Progress History Research

2443
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,800
So it is not very good to help those who do not write medical books

2444
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:39,400
medical participant

2445
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,300
But if we have a sense of gender

2446
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,700
In fact, participate in medical activities

2447
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:45,100
health care activities

2448
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,700
but no chance to write a medical book

2449
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,000
or leave your own gesture phrase

2450
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,100
Basically mostly women

2451
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,700
For many women involved in health care

2452
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,600
But they have the opportunity to write something

2453
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,000
we're going to use other data

2454
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,700
For example, time data

2455
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,800
or sculpture data

2456
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,900
This is what Buddha said just now in Parents N

2457
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Another one is

2458
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
The so-called push photo residence time

2459
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
mother taking care of baby

2460
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
If a child is in the middle of the night

2461
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
kill the piss

2462
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
mom puts herself

2463
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
push the baby to a dry place

2464
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
sleep in the wet

2465
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
so as not to put the child

2466
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
if you are

2467
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
when killing urine

2468
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
slap you

2469
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
call out

2470
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
this is not maternal love

2471
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
because of maternal love

2472
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
so gently

2473
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Piss-killing son pushes aside

2474
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
let him sleep dry

2475
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I will continue by myself

2476
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
sleep in wet places

2477
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
is the expression of maternal love

2478
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So

2479
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Babies are caregivers too

2480
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
very important role

2481
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
then we are in

2482
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
other materials

2483
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
also see

2484
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Actually nanny

2485
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
is a very important role

2486
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
No one has studied before

2487
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
then with this

2488
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
After the study of parent-child concept

2489
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
or caregiver

2490
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
as a mother figure

2491
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
After this research

2492
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
image of mother

2493
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Mother's subject

2494
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
also become negotiable

2495
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
The so-called milk becomes a mother

2496
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
who is called mother

2497
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
who is called mother

2498
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Although they are all called mom

2499
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Some are Zheng's wives

2500
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
is the aunt

2501
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
some tree mothers

2502
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
some are loving mothers

2503
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
some thick mothers

2504
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Some are foster mothers

2505
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
There is another kind called mother

2506
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,400
If a mother counts as a mother

2507
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,600
This is actually in Wei Jin's Mei Dynasty

2508
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,360
that's what i did

2509
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,300
This era of Yuan Cunda

2510
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,160
Doctor Shi debated very fiercely

2511
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:07,460
Some world doctors think

2512
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,200
Mom has milk like a mother has milk.

2513
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,300
You grow up by eating his milk

2514
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,360
Of course when he died

2515
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,560
Are you going to kill him for three months?

2516
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,360
least least

2517
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,560
Are you going to serve him privately for three months?

2518
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,000
But some world doctors say

2519
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,860
Rumu is basically born of compassion and Bodhisattva

2520
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,200
Born as a sad daughter in the family

2521
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,660
He just so happens to have tits for wild kids

2522
01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:23,660
That's why I came

2523
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:24,360
how can that be

2524
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,060
I am the precious son of the family

2525
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,260
how can i come for a slave woman

2526
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:30,620
He's dead and I'll take his wounds

2527
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,960
what is this like

2528
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:34,460
Who is the mother of the word mother?

2529
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:35,420
If you have milk, you are a mother

2530
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:36,960
The one who gave birth to you is the mother

2531
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,160
Or dad's wife is your mother

2532
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,360
This is actually what we do

2533
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,360
The era of Yuan Cunda

2534
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,260
there's a lot of debate

2535
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,960
Then Fujinian library except

2536
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,800
and ours

2537
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,960
Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall of Shiyusho

2538
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:47,860
Except what I just said

2539
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,060
That Yuan Cunda wooden outside

2540
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:50,360
There is also a very famous wooden

2541
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,560
It is Su Dongpo's nurse's wooden

2542
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,420
Seki Na

2543
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,160
this was me

2544
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:56,660
I also like to find Chinese reading

2545
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,760
but today is not enough time

2546
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:59,220
I'm also embarrassed to teach you how to read

2547
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,400
you can see

2548
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,400
Zhao Jun Su Shizi's sister is like a mother

2549
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,600
Ren Shiming Cailian, have you seen it?

2550
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,800
Su Shi Su Dongpo's nanny is called Ren Cailian

2551
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:14,600
This Ren Cailian is following Su Dongpo's mother

2552
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:18,000
married into Su Dongpo's father's house

2553
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,800
Come to their house for 35 years

2554
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,800
Miyahashi is diligent and thrifty, he treats the elderly, it is very good if he does not dump him

2555
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,000
Not only did he feed Su Dongpo's milk

2556
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Also fed the milk of Su Dongpo's sister Ba Niang

2557
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:32,800
And also helped Su Dongpo take care of her own son

2558
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,800
sushi's son

2559
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,200
Sell ​​on behalf

2560
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:41,800
It is equal to the three generations that nurse Ren Cailian helped to take care of

2561
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,200
As a result, Su Dongpo, because of party disputes,

2562
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,600
When he was demoted to Huang Gang

2563
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,400
He followed him and folded in yellow

2564
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,200
in the process of being demoted

2565
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,000
When the nanny went with Su Dongpo

2566
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,200
Yuanfeng three years

2567
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,800
This is 1080

2568
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,800
Died at Su Dongpo

2569
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Some people have children and sometimes they have children that are not their own

2570
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It is not necessary to benefit from death

2571
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
dead must be buried

2572
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
But not necessarily buried in his own box

2573
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I follow it from thinking about it

2574
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Its spirit is everything

2575
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
I come to worship you

2576
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I hope you come to eat

2577
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
in the future if i leave here

2578
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
i will send you to you

2579
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
i will send you to you

2580
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
i will send you to you

2581
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
in the future if i leave here

2582
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I worship you in different places

2583
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I hope your soul follows me too

2584
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
come and eat forever

2585
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Su Dongpo is a great writer

2586
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
The nanny is a member of his mother's family

2587
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
The sad girl followed and married

2588
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
The great writer not only helped him write his name

2589
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And this is Su Dongpo's words

2590
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Just make money by writing

2591
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
earn your own money write your own

2592
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Then ask someone to engrave such a famous name

2593
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
A woman born from grief

2594
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Get the name of a great writer

2595
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
and write by yourself

2596
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Why

2597
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
because of the mother's name

2598
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
There are mothers and milk TV mothers

2599
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
This Shepherd's name is in our library

2600
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's been a long time

2601
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
also in the 21st century

2602
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Our scholars are only beginning to notice this

2603
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
because realized

2604
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
and also see

2605
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,000
from the name of shepherd

2606
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Su Dongpo

2607
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
This feeling when being flattened

2608
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
right

2609
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
It is not necessary to be born because of nourishment

2610
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
It is not necessary to stand after death

2611
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Who knew Su Dongpo

2612
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
maybe you feel like

2613
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Maybe he died in Huanggang

2614
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
not impossible

2615
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
if i go back

2616
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I hope your soul will follow me

2617
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I will continue to worship you again

2618
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Fengyang

2619
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
so

2620
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
from different angles

2621
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
When I look at the medical room again

2622
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
what we saw

2623
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
medical classic famous doctor story

2624
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
this kind of medical room

2625
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
from the point of view of health care

2626
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
come in

2627
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
different stories

2628
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
on the other hand

2629
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
we also found

2630
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Women in the role of health care

2631
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Actually very diverse

2632
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
and frequently

2633
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Not only female doctors

2634
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Women's medical room is hard to do

2635
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,260
Find a female doctor

2636
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,260
In fact, just like this history of women's literature

2637
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:05,460
Hu Xiaozhen, Director of the Institute of Culture and Philosophy

2638
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:06,040
he just

2639
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,840
He returned to Taiwan almost at the same time as me

2640
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,040
and then work together in the Institute

2641
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,940
When he was doing history of women's literature

2642
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:12,140
I also find it very interesting

2643
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,640
Because he was a talker for women in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2644
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,840
women's articles

2645
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,940
but you know we used to do

2646
01:24:16,940 --> 01:24:18,040
in the history of Chinese literature

2647
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,280
I also find it difficult to do.

2648
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,280
It's hard for women

2649
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:23,640
Because Tang Poetry Sends Lyrics to Ming and Qing Dynasties

2650
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,840
There are not many female poets of Tang poetry

2651
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,080
talk about that

2652
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:27,880
That's the priestess

2653
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,320
Nv Ji Nv language selection machine or Xuetao

2654
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,120
There are not many people who send words and talk about them.

2655
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,720
It's the truth of accommodation, Qing Zhao

2656
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,020
Ming and Qing novels

2657
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:36,720
Little Writers Without Women in Ming and Qing Dynasties

2658
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,320
so there is nothing to write

2659
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,800
That is, if you use the original

2660
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,360
Existing classification

2661
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,560
Tang Poetry Sending Lyrics Ming and Qing Novels

2662
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,160
Then you say I want to be a woman

2663
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,460
Then you come to see the little female writers of the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2664
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:48,360
you'll find it hard to do

2665
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,360
But Teacher Hu Xiaozhen

2666
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,760
just use another way

2667
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,480
what does he use

2668
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,080
this difference

2669
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,680
He seems to be the same as last year

2670
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:55,480
Knowledge testing is here to talk about this

2671
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:56,120
right

2672
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,160
what he wrote from women writers

2673
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,960
to reschedule

2674
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,600
You don't have to be limited by Tang poetry, Song Ci, Ming and Qing novels

2675
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,440
women in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2676
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,640
She still writes poetry

2677
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,440
So although it is Tang poetry, Song Ci, Ming and Qing novels

2678
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,920
But the female writers of the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2679
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,880
with poetry long poetry

2680
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:16,280
to express the so-called talk of her story

2681
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:18,720
So there is no need to be limited by the original

2682
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,360
We can't find this predicament that women can do

2683
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,120
when we have this awareness

2684
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,760
When you look at the medical history, you will also find that

2685
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,160
The role of female single medical care is very large

2686
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,960
We used to be called Sangu and Liupo

2687
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,160
It's a curse word

2688
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,160
As a result, you look carefully

2689
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,200
actually what is it talking about

2690
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,600
nun taoist hanging aunt pharmacist

2691
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,160
Mei Po, Steady Po, Tooth Pot, Shiva, Ex-Woman

2692
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:38,240
medicine woman

2693
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:40,440
A stable woman is a miserable woman

2694
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,600
In fact, women's medical caregivers

2695
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,960
health caregiver

2696
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,840
what about others

2697
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,640
Nun, Taoist, hanging aunt, Shiva, ex-wife

2698
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,480
It's all about religion

2699
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,480
and sometimes involved in so-called religious medicine

2700
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,880
In fact, because of the relationship between single medical care, women

2701
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,680
health care

2702
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,000
If she often participates in birth, old age, sickness and death

2703
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
He really can't survive taking care of

2704
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
just can't give birth

2705
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
mother and son king

2706
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Or the baby in care dies

2707
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Or the serving mother-in-law died

2708
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
The story of healing youth

2709
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
The Tang Dynasty also started with a girl's story

2710
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
It's the mother-in-law he took care of

2711
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
nothing can cure

2712
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
He has no money for medical treatment

2713
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
He just takes the meat of his own thigh

2714
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Cut it off and feed it to my mother-in-law

2715
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
A story that also became very famous

2716
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
So when women who are health caregivers

2717
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
his story didn't make it into the medical room

2718
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
In fact, there are many medical faces of death

2719
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
is invisible

2720
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
when you see women in

2721
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
after the medical room

2722
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
You will find that women often

2723
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
There is no rush to take care of

2724
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
When he has to take care of many people at the same time

2725
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
there is no way to take care of

2726
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
I once read in the new Tang book "Legend of the Huntress"

2727
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
A story called Li Miaofa is

2728
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
he has married

2729
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
marry somewhere else

2730
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I heard that my mother's father was sick

2731
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
dying

2732
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
He can't go back and take care of his father

2733
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
he is a filial daughter

2734
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
so he is sad

2735
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I really want to go home

2736
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
when you can't go back

2737
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
I heard that my father

2738
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
has passed away

2739
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,840
Then he gave birth to another baby, can't go away

2740
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,200
He really wanted to go back to the funeral

2741
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,480
Because I heard that my mother is tired of taking care of my father

2742
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,520
sick too

2743
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,880
if he doesn't go back

2744
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:09,920
maybe the mother died too

2745
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,160
he won't be able to go back

2746
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,120
but when he left

2747
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,080
his one year old child

2748
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,880
just keep crying keep crying keep crying keep crying

2749
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:16,960
Ouyang Xiu is very powerful

2750
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,320
author of new tang book

2751
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,520
You must never believe what he wrote

2752
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,040
But what he wrote clearly shows

2753
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,240
The Dilemma of Women as Health Caregivers

2754
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:25,920
What

2755
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,400
Li Miaofa saw his son crying

2756
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,680
I want to go back and take care of my mother

2757
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:31,120
So he bleeds

2758
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:31,880
What's the meaning

2759
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,680
Cut off one breast and give it to my son

2760
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,520
then stay later

2761
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,520
and then he left

2762
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,080
It means that he wishes to be able to

2763
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,320
take care of both sides

2764
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,320
The ones here still need milk

2765
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,680
Those over there need his care

2766
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:41,680
How to do it

2767
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:42,960
cut off one breast

2768
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:43,760
leave it to his son

2769
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,520
Then he went back to take care of his mother

2770
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,200
This is the Legend of the Huntress in the New Book of Tang Dynasty

2771
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,200
Biography of Li Miaofa

2772
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Look at these frankincense

2773
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,360
The history written makes people put a big question mark

2774
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,280
But what?

2775
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,280
he clearly showed

2776
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,040
so-called candle

2777
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
burn both ends

2778
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,200
On Women's Participation in Birth, Aging, Sickness and Death Health Care

2779
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,700
Often catching golden arrows and walking away both sides will not please

2780
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,400
no way to succeed

2781
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,900
In this case someone must die

2782
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:13,600
But in fact, some have left their own children to take care of

2783
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,900
his brother's child

2784
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,800
Because otherwise he is afraid that people will talk about him

2785
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,300
Or his love can't bear it

2786
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:21,200
Seeing that my younger brother has become extinct

2787
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,400
If you die again, there will be no more

2788
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,000
So he had to put only one milk

2789
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,400
Just don't feed your own baby

2790
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,300
Just feed my brother's child

2791
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:29,300
As a result, his son died

2792
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,900
This is all written in the benefit biography

2793
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:32,700
if you don't

2794
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,000
we don't know he does this kind of thing

2795
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,900
Then write in the benefit biography

2796
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,200
If he did it, we'd be sad to see it.

2797
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:37,900
Because he is a candle that burns at both ends

2798
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:39,500
So someone is bound to die

2799
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,700
Women have religious expectations

2800
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:42,700
is normal

2801
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:45,500
He will seek the intervention of another world

2802
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,700
hope to have another chance

2803
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:48,400
so what

2804
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,200
history of religion

2805
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,100
look at

2806
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:51,600
Primordials are also a good example

2807
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,300
He's widowed twice and he can't take it

2808
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,200
where is he going

2809
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:54,800
become a monk

2810
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,900
I don't want to be a mother in this city

2811
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,000
role of wife

2812
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,400
I don't even want to be buried like before

2813
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
any one buried together

2814
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
I want to get the heart of cultivation that he needs

2815
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So the subject of religion actually has a gender awareness

2816
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
In fact, there are also very interesting phenomena

2817
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
For example, the one on the far left, these three are all Avalokitesvara statues

2818
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
The one on the far left is north

2819
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
The one in the middle is from the Song Dynasty

2820
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
The one on the right is from the Ming Dynasty

2821
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
you will feel special

2822
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Yes or no

2823
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
more and more like a girl

2824
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
We now see the statue of Avalokitesvara

2825
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Seems like it's a female image

2826
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
In fact, Guanyin should have no male and female

2827
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
is it a bodhisattva

2828
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
But when people come close to it

2829
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
In fact, there is a historical evolution

2830
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Early Avalokitesvara was like a male statue

2831
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Avalokitesvara can be seen in the era of Songzi Guanyin in Ming Dynasty

2832
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Already like a girl

2833
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
female admirers have a saying

2834
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
this is not my research

2835
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But some scholars have studied

2836
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
During the process from Beiwei to Song and Ming Dynasties

2837
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Female worshipers to Guanyin

2838
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It is the increase in the amount of worshiping Guanyin

2839
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Make the image of Avalokitesvara gradually

2840
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
From male to female

2841
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
That is to say

2842
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,080
and proximity make the person taking the photo

2843
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:04,840
Doesn't it mean that Bodhisattva has changed into a human being?

2844
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:06,280
No, still the same Bodhisattva

2845
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,320
but to create this image

2846
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,840
A craftsman or entertainer of the image of a Bodhisattva

2847
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,720
decided to make him appear as a woman

2848
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,680
Make this person who comes to worship him easier to get close to

2849
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,320
So a change like this

2850
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:19,520
The study of the history of religion

2851
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,360
I'm doing it gradually

2852
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,080
So, the relationship between women and religion

2853
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,120
really very close

2854
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,280
You can see the example of Yuanchun Camel, which is a good example.

2855
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,800
But he's not the only one

2856
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,120
we were at about the same time

2857
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,160
Until the Tang Dynasty, some herdsmen

2858
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:35,440
will see when the widowed mother dies

2859
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,680
Sudden dying said I don't want to be buried with your father

2860
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,240
Then this son will be very difficult

2861
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,200
Because it's customary

2862
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,760
Whether Confucian norms or expectations

2863
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,200
Parents' burial together is actually very important to this filial son.

2864
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,040
reputation is important

2865
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:54,160
But this mother has been widowed for so long

2866
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:55,080
and then fix until

2867
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:56,680
Then either go out or not go out

2868
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,520
Practice at home or practice as a monk

2869
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,200
Anyway, when he finally died, he told his son.

2870
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,560
That means I don't want to talk to my dad

2871
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,440
I don't want to grow up with your father

2872
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,040
At this time, this son's Mu Zhiming

2873
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,160
if you see

2874
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,080
The Tang Dynasty is the period from the Northern Wei Dynasty to the Tang Dynasty when this kind of Mu Zhiming

2875
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:12,720
You'll see the hardships of that son

2876
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,400
Because he wants to be a dutiful son

2877
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,440
But he can't let his mother be buried with his father

2878
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,240
So he will be in this Mu Zhiming

2879
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:21,520
in this preface

2880
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,040
A lot of thinking and emphasizing the hardships of being a widowed mother

2881
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,640
How to pull him up

2882
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:30,840
So in the end, his sons and daughters are respected and dare not stop

2883
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,560
The relationship between women and religion

2884
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,520
The way he died actually showed a lot

2885
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,200
to another world

2886
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,440
or his attitude towards religion

2887
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,400
This is also about the age we are doing

2888
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,120
In fact, burning life is included in the main case of bhikkhunis.

2889
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:45,680
Women burn raw offerings to Buddha

2890
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,560
Hope to be reincarnated and reincarnated as a man

2891
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,480
Only in the next life can I become a Buddha again

2892
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,240
Because of course it involves the issue of big students and small victories

2893
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,720
It's just that some people think that

2894
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,280
There is no way for women to get directly from this life

2895
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,520
Because it is born of misunderstanding, it will directly become a Buddha

2896
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,120
Must be transformed into a man in the next life

2897
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Only by cultivating as a boy can you become a Buddha

2898
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
because there is such a relationship

2899
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
So some female practitioners feel

2900
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Then I'll get out of this life

2901
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
because this is disgusting

2902
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I can't even become a Buddha directly

2903
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So there is burning body to make offerings to the Buddha

2904
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
There is also a Mr. Lu

2905
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
This is also our colleague

2906
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
My predecessor, Mr. Liu Shuheng made it

2907
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
It is women who want to make offerings to the Buddha

2908
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Is to give myself to my children

2909
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
he wants to be in the forest

2910
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
put the body in the forest

2911
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
or in a cave

2912
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Just don't bury it anyway.

2913
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Let the birds and beasts eat

2914
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Because this is to provide for all living beings

2915
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
In fact, it is making offerings to the Buddha

2916
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
is the same reason

2917
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
So with this idea

2918
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
In fact, in the same era

2919
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
There is a so-called concept of doomsday

2920
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
that is

2921
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Law will disappear one day

2922
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
will cause this dharma

2923
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
no way to go on

2924
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Three groups are the most dangerous

2925
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
most annoying

2926
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
most in need of correction

2927
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,000
be well supervised

2928
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
one is the monarch

2929
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
the king may be

2930
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Because at that time the law of destruction

2931
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
There was also the Northern Dynasty, and there was also the Tang Dynasty

2932
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
There are so-called kings who exterminate Buddha

2933
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
don't believe in buddha

2934
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
or believe

2935
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,240
or because buddhism absorbs too much of their taxes

2936
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:04,960
Or because saints are all monks

2937
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:07,620
Don't join the army, don't pay taxes, etc.

2938
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:09,500
So there are monarchs who exterminate Buddhas

2939
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,500
So there is a saying in this life group

2940
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,400
These are the Buddhist intellectuals

2941
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,340
will talk about the so-called destruction

2942
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:18,700
Three very serious effects

2943
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:19,740
one of them is the monarch

2944
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:20,900
bad monarch may

2945
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,500
So it is very important to correct and supervise the monarch.

2946
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:25,900
The other is the corruption within the Shengtuan itself.

2947
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,860
It may also result in a penalty

2948
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:30,160
The last one is the blackening of a woman's body

2949
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:31,660
So if a woman becomes a monk

2950
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:34,020
It will reduce Buddhism and politics by 500 years

2951
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,660
500 years or 800 years 500 years

2952
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,600
so at first

2953
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,400
Shakya's aunt

2954
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,560
When Da Yi is going to leave home

2955
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:42,960
Sakyamuni didn't want it

2956
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,060
But then there was an economic

2957
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:45,260
various discussions

2958
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:46,220
Finally let him leave the house

2959
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,400
But when you leave home, you must pay special attention.

2960
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,320
female practice

2961
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,660
don't let him misunderstand the body

2962
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,560
to influence other monks

2963
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,860
In fact among our colleagues

2964
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,500
It is in the research done by Teacher Liu Shufen

2965
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,900
You will find that there are some monks in this item

2966
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,960
Will write that it's a good thing he's not a monk woman

2967
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,660
or next to his lament

2968
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:05,160
inside famous saying

2969
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,700
this is my lock

2970
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,500
is where the burial

2971
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,400
how far away from women

2972
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,300
How far away from Bhikkhuni

2973
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,660
Yuan Chuntuo is very hopeful

2974
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:18,000
Don't hide his sleepy heart

2975
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,680
Of course he wants to be with other students

2976
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,540
you hide together

2977
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,380
Do you want to hide with your husband layman?

2978
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:23,100
But what?

2979
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,180
Sheng didn't want to hide with him

2980
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:26,980
Because after all, the female body

2981
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:28,180
under this context

2982
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:28,980
not good enough

2983
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,300
So there are women like this

2984
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,660
The Body Becomes a Religious Study

2985
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:35,460
or a subject for discussion in the history of religion

2986
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:37,300
Well, in order for women to get out of this

2987
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,260
a voice of misunderstanding

2988
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,060
Or get out of this pain

2989
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:42,400
He may have had various activities during his lifetime

2990
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,700
For example he might visit a temple

2991
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,000
he may visit holy key

2992
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,040
In addition, he may form the so-called women's society

2993
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,740
This is also the age we are doing

2994
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:51,740
from China until about modern times

2995
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:52,840
fifth to twelfth centuries

2996
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,880
There are probably such data showing

2997
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,440
women in the name of religion

2998
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:57,780
form a group

2999
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,740
Pay each other money

3000
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,960
It's the same as dating, but it's not economical

3001
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,960
For example, sometimes it is led by nuns

3002
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,200
The women of this village in this village

3003
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,840
How much to invest together

3004
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:09,760
then put it together

3005
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,840
if someone dies

3006
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,120
Let's help her with the funeral together

3007
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,560
If someone in the family is married

3008
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:14,400
when you need help

3009
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,880
Let's use this money to help her together

3010
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,360
or someone to help her

3011
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,760
People give people money

3012
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:20,360
a religious woman

3013
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,800
All-female religious groups

3014
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:23,760
to serve women special

3015
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,280
needs of birth, old age, sickness and death

3016
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,480
This has also been unearthed.

3017
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,600
This is relatively recent

3018
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,800
some are from the past

3019
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,600
Some are recently discovered historical materials

3020
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:33,400
if it is

3021
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,200
What you just said is that you are married

3022
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,200
then widowed

3023
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:38,440
Then there are these social life

3024
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,240
if not

3025
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,520
if she was young

3026
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,880
just want to get married

3027
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,560
In fact, we are in the Bhikkhuni Biography

3028
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,680
will see

3029
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:45,840
not easy

3030
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,800
even parents would still want

3031
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,200
he can marry

3032
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,400
so what

3033
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:52,040
The first forbidden solution in the Biography of Bhikkhuni

3034
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,960
The First Biography of a Bhikkhuni

3035
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,560
It is a forbidden solution in modern times

3036
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,760
he is already widowed

3037
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,800
he married

3038
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,840
then widowed

3039
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
On his own, he should have read the book

3040
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
fearless overcooked daughter

3041
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
He relied on his own poetic talent

3042
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,000
can play the piano

3043
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I went to different aristocrats' homes to work as tutors.

3044
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Feed themselves

3045
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
This is the story of the fourth century

3046
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
The Second Story A Second Example of a Bhikkhuni Biography

3047
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
not a widow

3048
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
The second example is a living female

3049
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
unmarried girl

3050
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
she wants to become a monk

3051
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Her father said tradition says

3052
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Triple, repeat again

3053
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
get married repeat repeat son repeat son

3054
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
why do you want to become a monk

3055
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
What is the weight of getting married? I have never heard of it.

3056
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
No such thing, don't let her become a monk

3057
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
The daughter told her

3058
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Why bother triple then reason

3059
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
why

3060
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Because what she wants to do is walk the walk

3061
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
jealous of everything

3062
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I don't care about my parents

3063
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
don't care about parents

3064
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Because the purpose of my leaving home is to

3065
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Hope to save all sentient beings

3066
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
help everyone

3067
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
let alone parents

3068
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
So you don't have to get married

3069
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
triple

3070
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
doesn't have to be triple

3071
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
is a reasonable approach

3072
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
But her father still didn't want to

3073
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
So then

3074
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Father, of course, has many stories.

3075
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,000
no more

3076
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
My father went to ask the Fotu City

3077
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
a big monk

3078
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
The great monk will give him one

3079
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
the story is too complicated

3080
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
talk too much can't talk

3081
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Anyway, it's right to convince his father.

3082
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
He put sesame oil on his hands

3083
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,000
tell him to go back

3084
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
After my father went back, he took a look on the sesame oil

3085
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
In the end, my father applied sesame oil to his palms.

3086
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Because I saw a big monk in the bonus

3087
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
then this

3088
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Fotucheng told his father

3089
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
You see, what you see is a bit like clairvoyance

3090
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
hand becomes a screen

3091
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Then I saw a big monk inside the bonus

3092
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Then this Fotu City told his father

3093
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
The big monk here is your daughter's previous life

3094
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
He was already a great monk in his previous life.

3095
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
In this life, I should have left home

3096
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
so you still have to leave home

3097
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
it will do you no harm

3098
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
After my father heard it, because of a magic trick

3099
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
The hand has become a screen

3100
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
so believe it

3101
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Just let my daughter leave the house

3102
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
As a result, after her daughter became a monk,

3103
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Because this father is in

3104
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Shila's men

3105
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
It is actually very heavy when it is tiger and hot

3106
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
the king of happiness

3107
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,140
After his daughter became a monk, this father actually

3108
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,140
The monarch is happy that of course his daughter is ordained

3109
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:05,820
So dad gave him a promotion too

3110
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:06,540
so this

3111
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:10,260
The final meaning of this biography of the bhikkhuni is that

3112
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,060
Why bother to triple and then be a gift

3113
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:16,020
In fact, to help parents, it is not necessary to get married

3114
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:18,540
If you become a monk, you can help your father get promoted

3115
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:21,900
Because marriage was very important at that time

3116
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:22,960
Marriage exchange?

3117
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,420
Those who are married can help each other and become officials so that they can climb up

3118
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:28,580
But this daughter relied on the way of becoming a monk

3119
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:30,980
Make my father promoted to the top

3120
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,900
There are actually many more stories.

3121
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:33,580
for example

3122
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:36,140
And the daughter wants to become a monk

3123
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:39,620
But mom has already set him up for a kiss

3124
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:42,580
So after the engagement, the fiancée over there has already made an engagement

3125
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,500
The dowry has come

3126
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,980
We just talked about the Taishi Law

3127
01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:47,220
This is the Tai Shilu in 267

3128
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,780
That is, if the offer has been accepted,

3129
01:38:49,780 --> 01:38:52,700
Even if you are already married, you cannot remarry

3130
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:53,620
what to do at this time

3131
01:38:53,620 --> 01:38:54,500
if you want to get married

3132
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,540
We must return their employment to others

3133
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:58,260
So in biography of bhikkhuni

3134
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:59,620
There will also be great monks

3135
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:00,060
just take

3136
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,760
The window head is washed with water. What is the window head?

3137
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:06,400
In fact, it is the slave stele wrapped in this black cloth scarf

3138
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,240
It means that the monk is actually very rich.

3139
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:12,640
He has slaves to run his treasures and human resources

3140
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:16,520
When he thinks that the debtor is going to become a monk, the debtor lady will follow

3141
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,800
when he is willing to accept him as an apprentice

3142
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:26,560
He can give one of his own servants to the betrothed husband's family

3143
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,840
As a companion to the original bride price

3144
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:33,160
You will know why the monarch will destroy the Buddha at that time

3145
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:37,680
Do you think that the money in this temple is actually very, very rich in manpower and material resources

3146
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,320
There will also be sayings in the bhikkhuni village

3147
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:41,400
Hey, the girl is engaged again

3148
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,760
He wanted to become a monk but his mother got him engaged

3149
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,120
After getting engaged, the son-in-law

3150
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:48,400
Even the engaged son-in-law refuses to let go

3151
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,960
Be sure to chase after, the girls have already gone to live in the temple

3152
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,320
He's going to run to him and harass him for trouble

3153
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,080
As a result, again

3154
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:59,280
This son-in-law was killed by a cow when he was about to go out to harass him

3155
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,120
like this type

3156
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,740
There are actually a lot of stories in this episode

3157
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:03,840
That is to say, widowed women become monks

3158
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,240
she has her way and her problems

3159
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,700
Besides, if you want to become a monk, she has her own way and problems.

3160
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:11,400
What will happen after leaving home?

3161
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:14,040
In the north, there are mud drills in the south

3162
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,700
There were so-called herdsmen in the Northern Dynasties

3163
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:17,340
As we just talked about, people like Yuan Cun Tuo Zuo

3164
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:20,000
In fact, there are also many monks and herdsmen

3165
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,240
For example, this bhikkhu mud

3166
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:23,540
A shepherd was unearthed

3167
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:24,340
can see

3168
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:25,740
Not only can he

3169
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,540
The Demon of the Empress Dowager of Civilization

3170
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:29,140
Go inside the palace to get the bonus

3171
01:40:29,140 --> 01:40:31,200
The so-called insider bonus

3172
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,340
Everyone recognizes the Empress Dowager Civilization

3173
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:35,860
Emperor Xiaowen's

3174
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:37,040
dark backup is grandma

3175
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:39,160
But my mother when I was in the north

3176
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:42,300
Later, grandma's concept seems to be a little confused

3177
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:43,140
but anyway

3178
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,860
He is raising the empress dowager of civilization and raising Xiaowen emperor

3179
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:47,260
Raising Emperor Xiaowen like this

3180
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,060
This one was later sinicized

3181
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:50,760
Empress Dowager Civilization herself is surnamed Buddha

3182
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,140
he asked for this

3183
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:56,440
This girl goes to the palace bonus

3184
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,400
this life

3185
01:40:57,400 --> 01:40:58,860
he has many mentors

3186
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:00,060
this disciple

3187
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,080
We don’t have time to talk about Tusun Network

3188
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:07,440
But the names are lined up with well-known intellectuals and officials at that time

3189
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:08,920
What about a person like this?

3190
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,080
We're not really sure where he came from.

3191
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,920
But after he entered the palace

3192
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:17,560
After he got a bonus in the palace and got acquainted with these concubines

3193
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:19,000
He suddenly said

3194
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,160
Actually, I have a pretty nice niece.

3195
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,440
You are talented, you have good virtues and surnames

3196
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,840
Later, the Empress Dowager Wenming was an emperor in the north.

3197
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:30,240
When the prince accepted his niece

3198
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,040
Later Queen Mother Lin

3199
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:37,320
So you can know that after the relationship between the entry bonus and the stinky concubine is established,

3200
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,480
He can also send his niece to the palace

3201
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:40,640
who is empress dowager lin

3202
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:41,840
Empress Dowager Lin is what we just talked about

3203
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,680
The heroine when Yuan Chuntuo was alive

3204
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:47,440
That is, when his son was emperor

3205
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,240
he is the de facto ruler

3206
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:54,720
In other words, Sunny because of faith, religion

3207
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,320
Especially the concubine who is like a female mud

3208
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:58,960
when he has no way to touch the outside

3209
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,160
What the girl said when she went in

3210
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,600
In fact, it will be influential

3211
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,600
It's not that there is no such thing in the Southern Dynasties

3212
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:04,480
Southern Dynasties also have

3213
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,400
There is a subtle influence in the Bhikkhuni Biography

3214
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,840
Appointment of envoy Kim Thu

3215
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,840
In fact, it later affected the political situation of the Six Dynasties

3216
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,280
We don't have time to talk about this anymore

3217
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,640
but anyway

3218
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:14,520
if you are a talented girl

3219
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,240
or you were born fine

3220
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:17,800
or you like to read

3221
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,480
or you don't want to get married

3222
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,200
If you do things like the Zhuzonghui and Guangji

3223
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,280
During the Northern Dynasties of the Wei and Jin people

3224
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,560
have a very good baked

3225
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,560
is to become a monk

3226
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,120
If you don't take you after you become a monk, you may go everywhere for bonuses

3227
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,040
Because they have to live in a temple

3228
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,480
Just like the Tang Dynasty, didn't we just talk about it?

3229
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,320
he can go anywhere

3230
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,520
So the Empress Dowager Civilization invited him

3231
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:37,240
I might ask him to give a speech in Pingcheng

3232
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,840
Came to Luoyang after bonus

3233
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,480
Maybe ask him for a bonus

3234
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,800
So in this case

3235
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:44,120
This bhikkhuni also travels everywhere

3236
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:45,880
And you can also recommend your niece

3237
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:48,040
After entering the palace, it became another

3238
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:49,920
The heroine is a social and political queen mother

3239
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,280
The relationship between these people is basically like this

3240
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:55,080
Yuan Chunta is here

3241
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,640
He first married Mu Shi

3242
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:57,880
later married new lou

3243
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,120
news

3244
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:00,120
Mu Shi gave birth to a daughter

3245
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
married to yuan

3246
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
In fact, the surname Yuan

3247
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Yuan Chuntuo

3248
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
you look

3249
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
still the same family

3250
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Yuan Weiqing was born

3251
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
It was later that he died in

3252
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,000
this place in this villa

3253
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
where is the empress dowager of civilization

3254
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
it's here

3255
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
where is empress dowager lin

3256
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
it's here

3257
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
where is the branch

3258
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
his aunt is here

3259
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,000
After Empress Dowager Wenming married Brother Xuanwu

3260
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
gave birth to younger brother Xiaomin

3261
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Empress Dowager Civilization

3262
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
The Empress Dowager of Civilization is also good

3263
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Empress Dowager Lin is also good

3264
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
we can say

3265
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Empress and heroine are

3266
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
The people Chen Dongyuan doesn't want to talk about

3267
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Wu Zetian's predecessor

3268
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
they are actually very important

3269
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's all because of the role of mother

3270
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,000
gave birth to a good son

3271
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
son made emperor

3272
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
then he can come

3273
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
social affairs queen

3274
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
So the role of mother

3275
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Actually there are many

3276
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
as a family

3277
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
The Transitional Role of the Ruler

3278
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
In the past, Chen Dongyuan felt that

3279
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
they are like normal people

3280
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
women don't matter

3281
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
But if we take the heroine

3282
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
It's the empress dowager

3283
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
When we put it in the family relationship we just talked about in the whole speech

3284
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
You will find that the heroine is actually a family role

3285
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
She's actually one because if it's my father it's the same father's family

3286
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
As far as family and country are concerned, a country is actually governed by one family.

3287
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
That's what the Emperor's House is in charge of.

3288
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:22,000
When there is a loophole in the succession order of the emperor

3289
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
There are not enough people to inherit. No heir or the inheritance is too small

3290
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
when you need help

3291
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:32,000
This mother believes that she is the most trustworthy and will not usurp the throne

3292
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Of course, before Wu Ze, I never thought about it

3293
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Somebody's going to literally throw their own son away and usurp her son's tail

3294
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
But at least not before

3295
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Therefore, since the Han Dynasty, my mother

3296
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
It's always been a time of succession crisis

3297
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
very important a substitute a transition

3298
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
The heroine is also in the context of such a family inheritance

3299
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
become a politician

3300
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Plus what we are reading now includes Yuan Chuntou

3301
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I just said that his original surname is Tuo

3302
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
There are so-called women's schemes to use Furen

3303
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Just listen to women's schemes, it's rare to fight a war

3304
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
But how to strategize is to listen to this tradition of women

3305
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
So before the old men came in to rule

3306
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
When they were in the grassland, there was already a so-called women's country

3307
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
It is the history and experience of women as rulers

3308
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
under this context

3309
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
When the Empress Dowager Civilization came in, she became a very important

3310
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
This is the research of other scholars

3311
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Put it in this context and share with you

3312
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
If we know that the Sinicization of Emperor Xiao Wen is the Northern Wei Dynasty of China

3313
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
very important word for a development

3314
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
In fact, there is a very important prerequisite to be able to Sinicize

3315
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
It was the reign of the Empress Dowager Civilization before him

3316
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
has laid the foundations of the so-called domination of farming nations

3317
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
a foundation of farming culture

3318
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
In the age of the Empress Dowager of Civilization

3319
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
He established the Fenglu of the ancestors of the Northern Wei Dynasty.

3320
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
That is to say he is no longer feudal

3321
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Not that I'm a monarch or that I'm a noble leader

3322
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
The following are my men

3323
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Then I will eat this piece of grass

3324
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,400
Instead, it becomes a centralized ruling monarch.

3325
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:07,600
Let's manage my bureaucrats by paying salaries

3326
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,200
This was established during the time of the Empress Dowager Civilization

3327
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:11,700
Sanchangzhi

3328
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:15,500
The so-called administrative bureaucrats at different levels at the local level

3329
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,500
It was also established during the time of the Empress Dowager Civilization

3330
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,000
The other one is the so-called Kimita Osamu

3331
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,200
everyone knows this

3332
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,800
make everyone sweeter

3333
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:25,000
Then the sweet tax is paid to the central government

3334
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,500
After all is paid to the central

3335
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,500
Then I pay the officers

3336
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,500
Under this monarch-subject relationship

3337
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:34,000
It turns out that feudal lords had their own soldiers and horses

3338
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Then do not listen to the phenomenon of central government

3339
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
will gradually become less

3340
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,500
So the Empress Dowager Civilization passed through his

3341
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:42,000
in his social age

3342
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,500
these political reforms

3343
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,000
institutional reform

3344
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,500
Emperor Xiaowen

3345
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,500
Have the opportunity to do so-called Chinese

3346
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:50,500
That is to say, wearing Han Chinese clothes

3347
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,500
Learn the language of Chinese Han people

3348
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:56,000
Or change it from Tuoba to Yuan, etc.

3349
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Empress Dowager of Civilization

3350
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Another heroine is the so-called

3351
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,400
Queen Mother Lin is actually a typical

3352
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,280
Use the role of mother to set up witness

3353
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,600
or a person who takes power

3354
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,280
Because in the Northern Wei Dynasty

3355
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:12,800
I'm afraid that the Queen Mother will set up a witness and rob power.

3356
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,280
So once a certain prince is established

3357
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,440
will kill this mother

3358
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,040
lest in the future this mother will take this child

3359
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:23,040
After the son becomes the emperor, he will take charge of the affairs

3360
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,520
Early Northern Wei Dynasty

3361
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:26,360
There has always been such a tradition

3362
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:29,880
Then Empress Dowager Lin's husband Xuanwu Emperor

3363
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,840
never had an heir

3364
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,800
Because the harem is very afraid of children

3365
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,200
In case I have a son

3366
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,640
i might be killed

3367
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,600
so the harem prays to each other

3368
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,040
or ask

3369
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,200
when were you pregnant

3370
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:43,200
when did i conceive

3371
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,240
if i found out i was pregnant a little earlier than you

3372
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,840
then watch this

3373
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,440
This is related to the medical book I just talked about

3374
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:49,800
Because traditional medical texts believe that

3375
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:51,320
If you are three months pregnant

3376
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:52,080
calling you from behind

3377
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:52,680
real

3378
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:54,320
if you turn to the right

3379
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,840
it will be a girl

3380
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:56,920
if you turn your head to the left

3381
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,640
it will be a boy

3382
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,080
Why male left female right

3383
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:00,080
there are various

3384
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So I discussed with you again that you got pregnant last month

3385
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I just got pregnant this month

3386
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
As a result, when I call you, turn around

3387
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
he will be male

3388
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
then i can continue to conceive

3389
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
So if I say I'm pregnant this month

3390
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I got pregnant earlier than him

3391
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Then I call me back

3392
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
i will have a boy

3393
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I will open

3394
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
i want to be later than you

3395
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
or if i turn around

3396
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
i will give birth to girls

3397
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
It does not matter

3398
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I will continue to conceive

3399
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Because my child will not experience the crown prince

3400
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
i won't be killed

3401
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
So the harem of the Northern Wei Dynasty

3402
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
When such stories are spread like this

3403
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
Queen Mother Lin said that in the middle of the night

3404
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
pray that i would rather die

3405
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I also hope to help my husband pass on the family line and receive

3406
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
you see how important it is

3407
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,000
understand

3408
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
a solid woman

3409
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
She prayed silently alone in the middle of the night

3410
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I don't know why this word comes out

3411
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Of course she came out by herself

3412
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
let everyone know she prays in the middle of the night

3413
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
I don't want to be like other concubines

3414
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I am not afraid of death

3415
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
I would rather have a son

3416
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
so that my husband can pass on

3417
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I also want to be able

3418
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
I would also like

3419
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
she looks like this

3420
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
that aspect

3421
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
According to the biography of Empress Dowager Lin

3422
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
She is full of talents

3423
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,540
Why does he have a little understanding of the Buddhist scriptures?

3424
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:03,000
Because his aunt is a nun

3425
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,340
bonus nun

3426
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:06,740
And his martial arts are also very powerful

3427
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:09,000
He once called a group of ministers to shoot arrows together

3428
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,740
everyone shoots well

3429
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,740
Then he shoots a real hole

3430
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:13,840
set over there

3431
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,500
One shot hits the real hole

3432
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,000
So all the ministers assisted him

3433
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,240
So the heroine is not just relying on

3434
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:21,940
Affiliation with groups or politics

3435
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,500
In Beihui, these heroines all had their own talents

3436
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:26,500
We just talked about the political strategy of the Empress Dowager Civilization

3437
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,500
You can see his establishment of this system

3438
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,000
Later Sinicization of Facts

3439
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,500
Very important foundation for success

3440
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,000
Empress Dowager Lin has such martial arts

3441
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,500
Then we can engage in mother-child kindness politics

3442
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:39,300
So then on the other hand

3443
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:42,200
The history books say that he personally writes the handwriting of Wanji

3444
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,000
He's actually the one who judges.

3445
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,500
I won't talk about the details today

3446
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,200
Another little book called The Words of the Princess

3447
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:50,000
Just the one introduced by Mr. Wu Xianwu

3448
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,300
It's just talking about how he judged the case

3449
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,100
Of course, at the end of the sentence, he was partial to girls.

3450
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,500
this is nonsense

3451
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,500
Well, he's not alone anyway.

3452
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,500
What's the meaning

3453
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,400
don't rule alone

3454
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,120
There are supporters next to him

3455
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:05,280
These supporters, apart from the ministers who admire him,

3456
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:06,800
or afraid of him

3457
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,840
In fact he has female staff

3458
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,600
Our subsequent research found

3459
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,080
Actually he has some princesses

3460
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:13,480
He has a good relationship with the princess

3461
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:14,720
This is appeasement

3462
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:15,720
what is this called

3463
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:18,040
Good relationship between walk away

3464
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,240
He has a good relationship with the princess

3465
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,960
He used the princess as a lady in a letter

3466
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,160
to help him with the paperwork

3467
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,080
help him pass the message

3468
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,120
Discuss things with him

3469
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,440
Do you guys think this is weird?

3470
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:28,720
It's not surprising at all

3471
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:30,320
if you go back and see

3472
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,560
Ban Zhao who wrote this female world

3473
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,080
In fact, when he was in Donghan

3474
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:37,160
It's the staff of Empress Dowager He Xideng

3475
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:38,240
the same

3476
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:40,080
He Xi but Empress Dowager Deng is in power

3477
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:41,040
while in power

3478
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,080
when being a hostess

3479
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:43,360
have all kinds of problems

3480
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,840
He will discuss it with Ban Zhao

3481
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:45,800
Ban Zhao suggested to him

3482
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:46,760
Because Ban Zhao came from

3483
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:48,080
big family

3484
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:49,760
who wrote this Hanshu

3485
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:50,840
he knows many things

3486
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,200
just discuss with him

3487
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:54,360
So the heroine is never alone

3488
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:56,120
But of course he depends on

3489
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:57,600
he's the mother thing

3490
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,160
climb up step by step

3491
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,040
get this

3492
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,440
dominant position

3493
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,560
But he needs to be able to rule

3494
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,200
It's definitely not just cruel and easy to kill

3495
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,240
or wait wait

3496
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,240
None of that kind came later

3497
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:12,240
The so-called fox girl can be the culprit

3498
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,640
in this slanderous language

3499
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,160
so you can get the truth

3500
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:18,320
In fact, these heroines have staff beside them

3501
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,720
There are people who help her

3502
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:20,720
It's hard not to say

3503
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,320
Female staff actually have

3504
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,920
And the staff of Queen Mother Lin

3505
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,480
Many of them came from the princess

3506
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:29,800
then this is an interesting place

3507
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,520
In fact, this research of the princess

3508
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,040
We used to study women's political history

3509
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:34,120
They are all research heroines

3510
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,240
They are all studying the female emperor, social and political empress dowager

3511
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,600
Few people study the princess

3512
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:39,840
i have a student

3513
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,760
He thinks I wrote Death of a Princess

3514
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:42,840
he is not convinced

3515
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,240
he thought he was going to write about the living princess

3516
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:45,400
what good things did you do

3517
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,320
He wrote a book called

3518
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,480
Princess politics without the Southern and Northern Dynasties

3519
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,200
The result is well written

3520
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,200
In fact, these princesses who have not lived in the Northern and Southern Dynasties

3521
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,280
It's not that you can't get involved in politics at all.

3522
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,080
And when they get involved in politics

3523
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,360
all successful

3524
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,920
The reason is that they use the so-called

3525
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,240
Physical Discourse on Liquid and Air

3526
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:04,640
It is absolutely impossible for a princess to become an emperor

3527
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:10,760
Except that the 50% daughter wants to become the emperor

3528
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:13,640
No other princess has the courage to become emperor

3529
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:14,960
no idea

3530
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,840
But what about them and their emperor brothers

3531
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:18,680
between us

3532
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:22,360
It can be said with this body discourse of so-called liquid with air

3533
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,960
The princess also cares about the country

3534
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:25,000
so the princess has her own

3535
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,080
untouched beauty princess

3536
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,640
has his own house, has his own residence

3537
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:30,640
Of course, father horses are miserable.

3538
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:32,960
In some books of that time

3539
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,160
In that file it will be written

3540
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,200
Father and horse are afraid to go home

3541
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:37,200
Because the princess, that's his princess' home

3542
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,280
The father horse seems to have been married instead

3543
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:40,520
The princess sometimes calls him

3544
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,000
tell him to come tell him to go tell him to go

3545
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,280
He doesn't seem to be his family

3546
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,760
So, the princess is the head of the family.

3547
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,720
that from a negative point of view

3548
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:48,640
father horse is in pain

3549
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,280
But because the princess has her own home

3550
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:51,640
And the housework, the student

3551
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,440
I made this location map of the residence of this princess

3552
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,000
In fact, it's just a little bit outside the imperial city.

3553
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,160
Therefore, the residence of the princess is often the so-called

3554
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,040
soft politics

3555
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,640
To kill a dragon is to kill a dragon, not to kill a dragon politically to kill a dragon

3556
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:04,440
where soft politics are enforced

3557
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:08,720
That is to say, when the monarch and his kings or ministers

3558
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,800
Fry and tear face in the palace

3559
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,720
There's no way to pull down my face anymore, there's no way to deal with it

3560
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:14,000
a case can't be solved

3561
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,520
or someone is going to be killed

3562
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,360
At this time, the princess will have a waist inkstone

3563
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,240
Waist they come to eat at home

3564
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:21,240
This time it is his brother who is the king

3565
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:22,840
sometimes even his brother

3566
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,680
Then he will act like a sister

3567
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:26,040
sometimes his brother

3568
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:27,800
Sometimes he'll use the phrase that we're all the same parents.

3569
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:29,880
born of this soft gesture

3570
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,080
to intercede

3571
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,480
then come to lobby

3572
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,120
and then to solve some

3573
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:35,640
Seems like it can't be returned

3574
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,040
But in the end it was transferred to Princess Juli

3575
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:39,160
something like this

3576
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:40,480
So after doing this

3577
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:41,280
we discover

3578
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:42,280
women's politics

3579
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:43,880
We all feel like we're going to be queen mothers

3580
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,160
Only female emperors and heroines can study

3581
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:47,160
Actually no

3582
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:49,640
Princess politics can actually be studied

3583
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,560
That means the identity of the daughter

3584
01:53:51,560 --> 01:53:53,800
the same person

3585
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,480
In fact, it is worth studying

3586
01:53:55,480 --> 01:53:57,720
Another student recently wrote an article

3587
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:58,600
that is a college student

3588
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:00,000
I really admire him and work hard

3589
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,880
And smart, I think female students in Taiwan

3590
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,800
They're all smart, beautiful, and hardworking

3591
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,800
It makes people happy when they see it, the more they interact, the happier they are

3592
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:08,800
This female student just wrote an article

3593
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:09,700
write what? write

3594
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:13,800
The tomb of Li Jingxun was excavated in 1957

3595
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,300
Since it was excavated

3596
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,800
because it has so many beautiful things in it

3597
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:20,000
So there have always been archaeologists or historians

3598
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:21,000
In fact, few historians

3599
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,200
Archaeologists do more than scholars of cultural relics and archaeology

3600
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,400
because it's these things

3601
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:27,400
Li Jingxun is with the generation

3602
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:30,400
Sui Dai, his surname is Li

3603
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:34,400
But his grandmother is the daughter of Emperor Suiwen

3604
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,400
Yang Lihua

3605
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:38,400
His father's surname is Li, of course

3606
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:39,900
Otherwise call me Li Jingxun

3607
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:42,900
His mother is the Yang family

3608
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:45,400
He came down with Emperor Wen's family.

3609
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:48,400
So there are so many beautiful things in his tomb

3610
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:51,400
Scholars of the past, after this tomb was dug up in 1957

3611
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:52,900
there have always been scholars

3612
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:55,900
From the shape of these cups

3613
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:57,900
The bath food of the necklace

3614
01:54:57,900 --> 01:54:59,400
or shape

3615
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,400
to study

3616
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,340
For example, these arts and crafts that come with the class

3617
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:07,200
Is it influenced by the West, including Persia?

3618
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,180
all kinds of these

3619
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:09,700
where did these things come from

3620
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:11,100
Is it made in China itself?

3621
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:12,540
Or was it sent by someone else?

3622
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:14,340
buried as a gift

3623
01:55:14,340 --> 01:55:17,400
Look at how old this girl died

3624
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,640
died at nine

3625
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:21,440
A nine-year-old girl came out with a lot of

3626
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,880
amazingly beautiful thing

3627
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,580
Of course it will arouse the interest of many scholars.

3628
01:55:25,580 --> 01:55:26,940
fifty years of research

3629
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:29,420
is studying each of these utensils

3630
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:33,280
Cultural traceability Art form and so on and so on and so on

3631
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,880
Until recently because of gender

3632
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:37,620
realized

3633
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:39,960
Why are these nine year old girls

3634
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:42,760
worthy of so many amazing things

3635
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,260
Let's go back and find out

3636
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:47,300
His grandmother is Yang Lihua

3637
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:48,600
Who is Yang Lihua's father

3638
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:49,940
Emperor of Hydrology

3639
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:53,760
Why did the daughter of Emperor Water Wen

3640
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:54,760
so important

3641
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:56,500
In fact, Emperor Shuiwen took his daughter Yang Lihua

3642
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:59,240
Married to the last emperor of the Northern Zhou Dynasty

3643
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:00,060
Then put the North Zhou

3644
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Give the state a string

3645
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,500
so understand what

3646
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:07,000
So Yang Lihua is very painful to her father

3647
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
just embarrassing

3648
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,000
An awkward and painful relationship with a woman

3649
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Yang Lihua is actually a princess

3650
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
but she wasn't a princess when she married

3651
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
she is queen

3652
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
she was married to be queen

3653
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,500
But after marrying the queen

3654
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:23,000
Her own father took her husband's

3655
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Stringed by the state

3656
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Then she becomes a weed

3657
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
like a princess

3658
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
She's not in the mood for a princess

3659
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Because she's actually the father of the kingdom

3660
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
her mood is kingdom father

3661
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
She loves her granddaughter very much

3662
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:39,000
This is Li Jingxun

3663
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
take her with you

3664
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
when her granddaughter is dying

3665
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
she died at the age of nine

3666
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
In fact, everything in it

3667
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It is likely that they are all collected by Yang Lihua

3668
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Not necessarily the collection of nine-year-old Li Jingxun

3669
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And that wooden or those wooden cups

3670
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,000
or those recorded in

3671
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
source

3672
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
The main numbers are from the Northern Zhou Dynasty

3673
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Then talk about how the Li family

3674
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I don't want to say that he is Yang Lihua and the daughter of Emperor Shuiwen.

3675
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
you can see it from here

3676
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
If you understand the barrier in terms of gender

3677
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
To understand this barrier from a daughter's point of view

3678
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,000
It’s not just about cultural exchanges, artworks, public welfare or things.

3679
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
what touches this topic

3680
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
In fact, it also includes the mood of a daughter

3681
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Use her granddaughter to express herself

3682
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
An attitude towards her addition and addition

3683
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
So it's interesting that the study is the latest one

3684
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
We haven't done enough research on daughters.

3685
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
There are many things worth studying

3686
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
in other words

3687
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
The last name of Yuan Cuntuo

3688
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Painted crouching blue bowl

3689
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Although it's all in the past

3690
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
But it can inspire us

3691
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
In fact, it's been a long way

3692
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
This division is not over yet

3693
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,000
still going on

3694
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
We got some inspiration from Yuan Cuntuo's life

3695
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
History also learns from gender

3696
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
And in the process we found

3697
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
people of different classes different ethnic groups

3698
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
For example, ancestors of different classes

3699
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
For example, something like Yuan Cun Tuo

3700
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
banned like this

3701
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,520
Or what we just said to help people produce

3702
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,760
This different class of midwives and stable women

3703
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,920
In fact there is age and backup

3704
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:10,920
will lead us to some of the past

3705
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:14,000
New perspectives on subjects taken for granted

3706
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,120
So if we can combine the empress with the heroine

3707
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:19,320
When put into context to understand

3708
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:22,560
In fact, there is no need to be so repulsive

3709
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,520
That is actually like

3710
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,120
The Story of Huiming Empress Dowager

3711
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:28,720
Empress Dowager Lin's Story

3712
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,120
including Wu Zetian

3713
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,720
Or Yang Lihua and his granddaughter

3714
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:33,120
these stories

3715
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,800
Stories from the royal family

3716
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,120
In fact, I put it in the vein

3717
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,200
in the vein of the family

3718
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,240
in the context of political operations

3719
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:41,240
or in the context of empire building

3720
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,280
In fact, there are many things to talk about

3721
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,640
and see something new

3722
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:46,600
Not necessarily with ordinary people

3723
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,800
Women's life in general doesn't matter

3724
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:50,400
may still be related

3725
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,040
that apart from gender

3726
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:53,600
I just said class and ethnicity

3727
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:54,960
we've always been like this

3728
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:57,640
I think this should refer to each other

3729
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:59,840
studied the 1986 scholar proposed

3730
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,080
It has been more than 30 years since I did this from a gender perspective

3731
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:06,140
After 30 years, in fact, we also found that as we just said

3732
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:08,520
Class and ethnicity other than gender

3733
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:11,260
In addition, age and backup in Chinese history

3734
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:14,080
is often well worth digging up

3735
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:19,460
So let’s continue to do it. Now some scholars have proposed the so-called multiple intertwined historical research.

3736
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:23,800
In fact, historical research is inherently diverse and intertwined, and it is impossible to talk about it from only one angle.

3737
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,880
Today I'm just starting with a gender perspective

3738
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:29,440
Then use the round-lipped camel as an example

3739
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:32,520
I hope to share with you what we have done in the past 30 years

3740
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:36,100
What is the outcome of historical research on gender studies?

3741
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:41,980
Then also as a congratulatory gift to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Academia Sinica and the Eleventh Institute

3742
01:59:41,980 --> 01:59:43,520
hope to

3743
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:46,340
Let everyone be able to hear and be happy

3744
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:50,440
History is basically a broken mirror and everything is actually broken

3745
01:59:50,440 --> 01:59:51,960
We are fighting together

3746
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:53,760
Let's see if we can spell it out

3747
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:57,080
Sometimes it can look like a mess of refracted reflections

3748
01:59:57,080 --> 01:59:59,400
But it still looks a little bit

3749
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,500
The same is true for the study of gender or women's history

3750
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:03,760
thank you for listening

3751
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:04,260
Thanks

3752
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:08,960
Thank you very much Mr. Li for your wonderful speech today

3753
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,960
That's because we have limited time now

3754
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:12,300
Teacher Li just mentioned that

3755
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:14,660
This year is actually the 90th anniversary of Academia Sinica

3756
02:00:14,660 --> 02:00:16,400
So we will prepare a

3757
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,800
A special coaster for the 90th anniversary of Academia Sinica

3758
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:21,360
Wait a minute and open up to friends who have problems

3759
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,660
that's because of time

3760
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:25,160
We might just open up and ask three questions today, okay?

3761
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:26,260
ok first

3762
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:27,960
hey ask the professor

3763
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:30,060
the one you just mentioned

3764
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:32,160
There are six kinds of women

3765
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:34,160
ask that toothmaid

3766
02:00:34,160 --> 02:00:36,660
what with that ex-wife

3767
02:00:36,660 --> 02:00:38,160
do something

3768
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:38,760
Thanks

3769
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:43,960
intermediary

3770
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:48,360
A broker is a middleman

3771
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:50,660
The kind that sells as an intermediary

3772
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:52,760
According to the ex-wife

3773
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:54,160
Actually it's kind of like

3774
02:00:58,560 --> 02:00:59,260
wife

3775
02:00:59,260 --> 02:01:00,260
wife

3776
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
The old castle, he said it was the old castle

3777
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
That means they are all that

3778
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Wang Kilometer's

3779
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
no no no no

3780
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Three aunts and six wives are not kings

3781
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
If we want to say three aunts and six wives, we should say she is a professional woman.

3782
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
It may be said that it is an ancient professional woman

3783
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
However, the third aunt and the sixth wife

3784
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Fighting together is to make these nine kinds of people

3785
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Get together and talk about them like this

3786
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
They are three aunts and six wives. This is after the Yuan Dynasty.

3787
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
in the age of what we do

3788
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I have sent every water hall

3789
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Basically these people are normal working women

3790
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
But when someone thinks these women

3791
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Ordinary women from good families should not talk to these outsiders

3792
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
when women walking around are together

3793
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
From Yuan Dynasty to Ming Dynasty

3794
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
start like a scholar

3795
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
put some working women outside

3796
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
become a group

3797
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
call it three aunts and six wives

3798
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Then he said that women from good families had better not follow

3799
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Three aunts and six wives together

3800
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
But in fact it is impossible

3801
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Because our case in the Ming and Qing Dynasties is also good

3802
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
or

3803
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
note novel or art inside

3804
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
still see like this

3805
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Mrs. Wen will still go into the house

3806
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
help give birth

3807
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Grandma will still help the broker to do business

3808
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Matchmaker is still needed

3809
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
possible today

3810
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
probably not today

3811
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
at least when i was a kid

3812
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
It seems that they are still needed

3813
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
so this is

3814
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,000
It's just that Rusheng doesn't like this kind of women outside

3815
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
This is the division between male and female

3816
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,000
more and more

3817
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
After the room between men and women became more and more strict

3818
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
just some people who work outside

3819
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
female becomes a

3820
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
anonymous group

3821
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
But in fact they are

3822
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Women who work outside are like this

3823
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
that mistress is

3824
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
The so-called Ning just mentioned that

3825
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
to be the family dancers

3826
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
I'm sorry

3827
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,000
dancing witch

3828
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
What is dancing witch

3829
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
dancing witch is

3830
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
go block

3831
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Find a way to summon the soul, what, what?

3832
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,000
kind of religious

3833
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
this is possible

3834
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
It means that we boys serve wine and leave wine behind

3835
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Those three aunts and six women stink

3836
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
just had nine

3837
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
It means to drink and stay

3838
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
This master feels here

3839
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
ok thank you thank you

3840
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,000
There is a picture of Beizhong military uniform you just mentioned

3841
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
You said he himself had guarded his father for thirteen years

3842
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
But I see his eldest son in the picture below is also three years old

3843
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
what happened

3844
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
That's why the patrilineal family is so important

3845
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Dad is the eldest son

3846
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Because if the eldest son lives in the future,

3847
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
should i die

3848
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
he wants to inherit me

3849
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
is the main axis of this paternal family is on him

3850
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
In the end he died before me

3851
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:32,000
So I'm not for the love of children

3852
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I do it to honor the patrilineal lineage.

3853
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
So I have also been rotten for him for three years

3854
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
also the worst injury

3855
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
so this father

3856
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
That's why it's called the patrilineal family system

3857
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Paternal haircut, paternal why is it called paternal paternal

3858
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Dad is the core

3859
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Everyone revolves around this man who is a father

3860
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
To regulate or regulate the relationship between relatives and inferiors

3861
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
A child with his mother

3862
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
not because you gave birth to me

3863
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I'm the closest relationship with you

3864
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It depends on your relationship with my father

3865
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
You and my father are the wife's relationship

3866
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
you are my aunt

3867
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
After you passed away, I just played for your husband for three years

3868
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,000
you gave birth to me

3869
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
But your relationship with my dad is just bad

3870
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
my dad's concubine

3871
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
If you die, there's nothing you can do

3872
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I have fewer husbands

3873
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Because all our relationships revolve around Dad

3874
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
This so-called traditional Chinese patrilineal family society means

3875
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Okay, let me recall what you just said

3876
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
That production that vertical production

3877
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I traveled to Argentina last year

3878
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
their aboriginal local aborigines

3879
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,000
The localization of their production is on the wall

3880
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
on their original wall

3881
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
vertical production

3882
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
that knowledge

3883
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
and when he gave birth

3884
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
His arms are still on that wall

3885
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Said that there was that cruel hand on the wall

3886
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
plug it in like this

3887
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
just like this

3888
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
then your side

3889
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Because you're all in Europe and look like that

3890
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
But that's from Argentina

3891
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
I echo your matter

3892
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
OK

3893
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Ask our colleagues who have done archaeological and anthropological surveys

3894
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I said you stepped on the Amis

3895
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
How about it

3896
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
He said I went and when I came back he told me

3897
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
I asked and my interviewer said

3898
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Yes, yes, I squat down and get down

3899
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:10,000
So actually by the end of the twenty-four seasons

3900
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Taiwan is still like this

3901
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
So the one who was lying in the hospital gave birth

3902
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Then let the doctor do this

3903
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
All are medical

3904
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
very late quiet on human power

3905
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
very short period of time

3906
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Now actually because

3907
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
The relationship between the industry and the city movement

3908
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Or a home birth, or a gentle birth

3909
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Various sports appear

3910
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So actually a while ago this topic

3911
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
The group I'm currently in tender production with

3912
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Told once, all the midwives

3913
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Everyone came to me

3914
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Come and take a photo with me holding the cup

3915
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
I am also very happy

3916
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
So now it's back again

3917
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Hope to take this living person as the main body

3918
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
See how comfortable he is and how easy he is to move around

3919
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Instead of this one that is mainly based on the convenience of doctors

3920
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
In fact, it is revival

3921
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
ask the teacher

3922
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,000
teacher

3923
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,460
The last word is Broken Mirror Temporary

3924
02:06:04,460 --> 02:06:06,960
remind me to say

3925
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,460
Teachers can use this pedal

3926
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,460
then about sex

3927
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:13,460
And then there are many places

3928
02:06:13,460 --> 02:06:15,460
Many items are available

3929
02:06:15,460 --> 02:06:18,960
Can do research on science

3930
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:20,960
reminds me of being in that

3931
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:23,960
There are many steps in the forest of steles

3932
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,460
In fact, using this site analogy

3933
02:06:25,460 --> 02:06:28,960
In fact, it is tantamount to making a fuss out of a molehill

3934
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:31,960
is that we can communicate with many

3935
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,960
different categories

3936
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:35,960
As a result, such research can be done

3937
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:36,960
Is it this way

3938
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,960
ok thank you teacher

3939
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:53,960
Materials actually help us understand

3940
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:55,960
Many handed down documents above

3941
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:56,960
no way of knowing

3942
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:58,960
The problem with the pedals

3943
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:00,960
just say sometimes context

3944
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:00,920
not very clear

3945
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:02,360
if you know where it comes from

3946
02:07:02,360 --> 02:07:03,320
then what is the context

3947
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:04,400
Then make the content

3948
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:05,720
Just like Yuan Chuntuo

3949
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:06,920
there must be many things

3950
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:08,320
will help us open our eyes

3951
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:09,720
It's something we couldn't imagine

3952
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:11,400
thanks for your test

3953
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:18,400
I will let you know before the end

3954
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:19,760
Feast of Knowledge in October

3955
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:21,440
back to our tree science group

3956
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:23,720
Director Chen Guixian of Fate Institute

3957
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:26,200
Tell us about thermoelectric technology

3958
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:29,400
Topics from domestic refrigerators to space communications

3959
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,400
Everyone is welcome to sign up

3960
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:32,680
Then we thank Teacher Li again

3961
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,680
Thanks
