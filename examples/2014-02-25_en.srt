00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,720
kilometres but

2
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:42,080
the

3
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:51,100
I am

4
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,220
able.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He is also the secretary-general of our headquarters. Let's welcome him first.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Also present here are academician Li Zhenhui and several people from our hospital.

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Distinguished Research Fellows and Research Fellows

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and ladies and gentlemen and students

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Welcome to our Academia Sinica

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Feast of Knowledge in February

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The Feast of Knowledge at Academia Sinica is a popular science speech

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I hope that every outstanding researcher of Academia Sinica

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The results of these studies have been shown in an in-depth manner

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
to introduce to the public

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Today we are delighted to be able to invite

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Special Researcher Wu Jinglie is also our Secretary-General Wu

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come and talk to us all about it

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me briefly introduce Secretary-General Wu

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Secretary-General Wu is from the Longhua Department of National Taiwan University

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
After getting a bachelor's and a master's

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
at Arkansas University School of Medicine

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Receives Ph.D.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
that after receiving a Ph.D. in 1975

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He returned to the Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
which is now the cell

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Institute for Individual Biology

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
research work

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Later served as Deputy Director

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So for 38 years he has been working on

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Basic research and applied research of aquatic biotechnology

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You may have seen glowfish on the seals

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Everyone is curious, who invented the fluorescent fish

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We can ask the secretary general to talk to us later

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The process of developing this fluorescent fish

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
quite wonderful

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
actually in this

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Secretary-General Wu's research

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is a prospective fish study of Taiwan

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There are also aquatic features

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do this fish biochemistry

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Fields of Study

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In today's information, you can see

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,700
Many innovative research results

44
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,940
Including the development of the muscles and liver of this zebrafish

45
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,300
and the use of zebrafish as an animal model

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,700
to study the human Python and hepatitis virus

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,800
How to cause intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
This is a very innovative research

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,300
what about the other

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,800
Innovative research includes

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Mechanism and Prevention of Fish Virus Infection

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,900
There is also the sculpture control of muscle growth

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,200
Research on regulation and balance

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
and viewing

55
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,500
Fluorescent ornamental fish

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
There is also a turning point due to poor control of the fish

57
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,300
If you bought a glowfish today

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,500
These fluorescent fish can also give birth to the next generation

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,700
This glowfish probably won't sell for a lot of money

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,800
If this fluorescent fish can't give birth to the next generation

61
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Then you wait until this fluorescent fish dies

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,600
I have to buy another one, right?

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,800
So the unlicensed technology is very important

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Let your industry of this fluorescent fish

65
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,100
able to thrive

66
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,300
So how do you make the fish unlucky?

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,000
This is a very deep technology

68
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,000
We can also find out later

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then its research results are published in the main

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
A total of 201 academic journals

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,400
He also holds 6 US patents

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,760
Taiwan has 9 patents

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,600
And there are already 8 pieces counted

74
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,320
And he insisted on being in the world

75
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,240
These famous monographs

76
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,360
There are a total of 20 articles written in this chapter

77
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,280
This Wu Distinguished Researcher is also

78
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Our Secretary Wu

79
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,880
As I said just now, he served as the deputy director and the director

80
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,000
that for the whole animal

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,560
research and infrastructure

82
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,800
made a great contribution

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,720
In addition, he also served

84
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,120
The very important position of our central researcher is called the executive secretary of the Academic Advisory Association

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
And the director of the dean's office

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,520
It is

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,840
secretary general

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,760
that help promote the academic development of the College

89
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,080
have important responsibilities

90
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
In addition to the service in this hospital

91
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,040
Our Secretary-General Wu for his

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,400
Nationwide agribiotech push

93
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,160
also play an important role

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,000
So he promoted the adoption of agricultural biotechnology by the painting department

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
Industry Promotion Program

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
in this plan

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,000
Hope to promote Taiwan's agricultural biotechnology industry-university cooperation

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
and industrial guidance

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,000
And how to authenticate and sanpinhua

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
These things are quite important

101
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,200
So Secretary-General Wu in 2013

102
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Awarded this Agricultural Biotechnology Contribution Award

103
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,800
It is obvious that Secretary-General Wu's promotion of Taiwan's entire agriculture

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
play a very important role

105
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,200
In addition to playing a very important role in domestic agricultural biotechnology

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Promotion of international academic research

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,600
also play many important roles

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,400
including his past experience as a member of the International Committee for Scientific and Technical Information

109
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
叫MOON

110
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,200
and the International Council for Science

111
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,900
ICSU

112
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,800
and the International Union of Biological Sciences

113
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,000
Member of the Executive Committee of IUBS

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,300
So it is a very important contribution

115
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,100
More importantly, Taiwan International Sea was established in 2012

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,760
Society of Deep Object Technology

117
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,200
And he is the chairman

118
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,960
So no secretary can say

119
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,640
All the way to Taiwan's agricultural biotechnology

120
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,040
Especially aquatic biotechnology

121
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,440
made a great contribution

122
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,760
Of course someone with such a good performance

123
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,800
Must have won many academic awards

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,240
including ten outstanding young people

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,920
Of course when he was young

126
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,280
And this National Science Council Distinguished Research Award

127
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
And Hongjindui's

128
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Distinguished Honor Award

129
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
National Science Council Special Investigator

130
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
and Distinguished Special Investigators

131
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,760
So many awards

132
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,920
So if you want to hang

133
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,200
The medals on my body are endless

134
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
what about today

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,160
very happy

136
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,600
Wu special researcher will come to tell us

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,560
deep object technology

138
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,200
and the sustainable development of deep marine resources

139
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,560
Then wait a minute and everyone can listen to his speech

140
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,920
just know

141
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,520
his contribution to this

142
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
and very important marine

143
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400
this deep resource

144
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,720
It is very important for our human health

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,000
so

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,080
Today we hope that after listening to his speech,

147
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,340
be able to return home with a full load

148
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,000
And after a big meal

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
have a rewarding experience other than

150
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,680
Gain better knowledge

151
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,040
So now let's give this kind of applause

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,280
Come welcome Master Wu Yun

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,500

applause

155
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
applause

156
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
applause

157
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
applause

158
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,400
First of all, thank you Dean Chongwu for this introduction

159
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,900
Award-winning introduction

160
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,200
Distinguished guests, Mrs. Li Yan, directors

161
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,700
Mr. Lee

162
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,200
Dear colleagues, fellow students, hello everyone

163
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,740
then i am ordered today

164
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,400
Mr. Chen Wuyun said this, right?

165
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,740
knowledge in Chinese

166
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,900
Miss this popular science speech

167
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,000
Can introduce my field of research

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,240
Then let everyone learn from this scientific research

169
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Then it can be implemented on the popularization of this knowledge

170
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,200
then i today

171
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
speak today

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It is one hole combining two

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
One is the sustainable development of marine biological resources

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If applied to the most important fields of biotechnology in the 21st century

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let the resources of our planet's oceans

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
i don't stress

177
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Usually we speak from various human-centered subjective viewpoints

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
perpetual use

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
use seems too subjective

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then I think sustainable development is a harmony

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and a concept of coexistence

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let our planet's resources

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
especially raw resources

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
sustainable development

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
then we all know

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll watch this first

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sorry

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
what about our earth

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
actually a water polo

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
right

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That is to say, the earth

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
largest area

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It is also this water that covers

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So we say Earth's

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,240
It's unique, it's in the universe

196
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,400
human knowledge

197
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,900
Haven't found an environment like ours

198
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,900
with plenty of water and air and sunlight

199
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,300
Enough to conceive for the creature to evolve

200
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,900
So the creatures on our planet Earth

201
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,800
Without water, it can be said that there is no living thing

202
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,700
aerobic bacteria without oxygen

203
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,600
but without this oxygen

204
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,100
It is absolutely impossible for any living things to exist without water.

205
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
so we can all understand

206
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,700
The water or ocean is very important

207
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,500
So what I'm telling you today is that the ocean is

208
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Not only sea water is fresh water, but it is also made of acquatic resources

209
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,700
What we know about

210
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,700
So the outline of mindfulness that I am going to tell you today

211
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,300
probably under this area

212
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
One is that we use Taiwan to exchange our eyes for the world

213
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Check out this comparison between Taiwan and the rest of the world

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Our situation in the development of marine biotechnology

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Compare this with ours

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
so what

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because I participated in the report of the deputy dean just now

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm the one who's involved in our country's

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
agricultural biotechnology

220
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
industry development

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So what about our development strategy?

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so let you know

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So our biotech industry

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
How to develop in this area

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What about the third one?

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
in my lab

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
did some research work

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Some important points mentioned by the vice president just now

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and then explain it very clearly

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Then as a strength

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let everyone know what is marine biotechnology

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
or biotechnology in aquaculture

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Then the fourth item is of course

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What about the application of marine biotechnology?

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Innovate with the industry

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
this is very important

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If Taiwan does not have no innovation

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Drive the development of the industry

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I think Taiwan may be so competitive

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There is no way to do this in the international

241
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,340
We can take the lead in this industry platform

242
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,500
So industry innovation

243
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,440
If research results from academia can be translated

244
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,640
I also want to make some introductions on this part

245
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,740
Then the fifth item is that we now talk about food safety

246
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Very important

247
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,240
So our food safety regulations in Taiwan

248
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,040
After all, it is in line with international norms, especially in terms of water length

249
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,540
where are we the same

250
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,140
where is our weakness

251
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,240
The shortcomings are what we must pursue

252
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,440
Otherwise, there is no way for our industry to be internationalized.

253
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,740
Then the last thing is to put my personal experience in the field of marine biotechnology

254
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,440
Promotion through the Society

255
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,040
Then let's drive the development of Taiwan's technology

256
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
And finally the future

257
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,340
let's look at the first

258
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,640
This comparison of the development of international and Taiwan marine biotechnology

259
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,840
That just mentioned that the earth is a water globe

260
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,340
Then the total surface of the earth is 360 million square kilometers

261
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,740
71%

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
ocean cover

263
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So of course there's this blunt bluntness that's bred in it.

264
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Calculated by the amount of protein that naturally exists on the earth

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
In fact, 90% of the animal protein on the earth is

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
living things in the water

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So it can be seen that the ocean is very, very important to us

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
no ocean can be said to be our side

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
there is no way to survive forever

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So develop this marine industry

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Not only do we get food

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We can also acquire new medicines

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Energy and Permeable Chemicals

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So often in the discussion of various technologies

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Everyone thinks that Ossisky humans need to develop further

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Shou County because of the land

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The ocean is where we can still play

278
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
important area

279
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So is the technological revolution that thinks blue

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This includes the development of technology

281
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Application with industry

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The biggest problem facing us as human beings

283
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,900
now everyone knows

284
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Earth's population is still increasing

285
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,000
Climate change causes, for example, the warming of the earth

286
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There is also pollution that causes the environment in which we live

287
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
getting worse

288
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The third is the circulation of human diseases

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Or aging is a very important issue for everyone

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's see in 200 years

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Earth's population has exceeded 6 billion

292
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
In 2013 and 2011, it has exceeded 7.1 billion

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
this is amazing

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Nearly 900 million people in ten years

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It is estimated that the earth's population will reach 9 billion by 2050

296
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
will still go up

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Then here comes the problem

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The expandable area of ​​the earth is actually shrinking in a straight line

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
population has been increasing

300
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And it can be seen that this trend emerges

301
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Still pretty much this Stip

302
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Although the population of our Taiwan is growing world ranking shop

303
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But for Obole, the whole world is still...

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
A child is born with only one mouth

305
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,900
For a mouth to eat you have to have enough food for them to eat

306
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,140
So the problem facing our planet

307
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,740
If the biological resources of the ocean are combined with technology

308
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,200
The development of biotechnology can solve the

309
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,640
not too long before 2050

310
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,800
only 37 years

311
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,340
do a lot more

312
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,040
Still on this earth for more than 37 years

313
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,100
what are we going to eat

314
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
this is a worldwide problem

315
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,840
It's not just Taiwan's problem

316
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,640
So because we in Taiwan are very lucky

317
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,040
We not only have mountains and land

318
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,440
It's more important for us to have the ocean, right?

319
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,140
So in the far sea countries of the ocean

320
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,300
Well, besides us, Taiwan can develop agriculture

321
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,900
and industrial biotechnology

322
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,400
Medicine Beyond Biotechnology

323
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Marine Biotechnology We Are Not a Landlocked Country

324
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
If we were Mongolia today

325
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,700
Then we didn't show off our power in this area.

326
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,000
Maybe we need to develop the wood industry, right?

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
But our Taiwan ocean

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,500
The investment in marine biological technology has a great impact on our eleven system-based entertainment

329
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,800
Such resources can be used continuously

330
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,500
So for us Taiwan is an ocean country

331
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
is very important

332
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,500
So in our government and academic research

333
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,000
First we can see that

334
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,500
In this marine life technology that can develop

335
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,000
Promote innovative industrial development with the basic biological blood position foundation

336
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,000
academic and industry

337
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The need for the concept of truth is particularly prominent in Taiwan at present.

338
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because not only the industry needs to develop

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,500
create our economy

340
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
It also creates job opportunities

341
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Then let our industry be on the international stage

342
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:50,000
Can compete with others

343
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At the same time our continued use of the marine environment

344
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,500
that is very important

345
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,000
Whether we can destroy our marine environment

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
or access to these resources

347
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,320
Well, because we are doing basic research

348
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,460
Therefore, the field of flower houses should start from the basics

349
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,800
So at the base we except molecular biology

350
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,300
the flower field reproductive biological genetic

351
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,920
Genomics Gene transfer

352
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
then wait

353
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,660
The study of disease is very important and immune

354
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,960
Because the control of this disease is

355
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,120
not only important to people

356
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,320
It is also necessary for these creatures

357
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,660
from here we can

358
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,200
not only get this food

359
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,120
At the same time we can get biological active substances

360
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,200
so in the ocean

361
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,620
For example, we are famous in Taiwan

362
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,320
We get collagen from Wu Guoyu Yilin Tablets

363
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,400
then from some early years

364
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,820
Recently, flower houses in Taiwan usually get this crane halide

365
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,160
Can be used as an adjunct to chemotherapy for this cancer

366
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,520
very effective product

367
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,920
Therefore, the active substances of marine organisms

368
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,420
There is a lot of room for development

369
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,040
then the marine environment

370
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Sustain applications that include energy

371
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
including this removal of contamination

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
biotechnology for the marine environment

373
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is very important

374
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
so what

375
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This extends to the industry

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What about Taiwan?

377
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This technology of production and breeding in the past is very good

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So we keep introducing new technology

379
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let Taiwan's production and breeding technology

380
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
able to continue to use

381
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Personally, I will dig deeper in this area.

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That pair of marine naturals blossoming into medicine

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Flowering into new biomaterials

384
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What about materials that blossom into energy?

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
These are quite potential

386
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And finally, the protection of the environment

387
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What about resource management?

388
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it's all about this

389
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
In terms of application, it has considerable potential.

390
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
so let's see

391
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The countries of the world these from Asia

392
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
all the way to this Europe

393
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What about the countries of the world?

394
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's in the research field of marine biotechnology

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it does some tidying up

396
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Discovery, such as Asian countries

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,240
It says that 80% of aquaculture production is in the Asian region

398
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Therefore, countries in the Asian region include Taiwan

399
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,000
China, India, South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia and other countries

400
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Aquaculture, marine biotechnology

401
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
In particular, Taiwan attaches special importance to

402
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Various resources including living organisms and other biofuels

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Just mentioned medicine, food, feed, peanuts, etc.

404
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
are doing

405
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The same goes for other countries

406
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But the resources of marine organisms are different

407
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Fish, Shellfish, Shrimp, Microorganisms

408
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
algae are different

409
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
so spendable features

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
find new discoveries

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Of course, each from the biological conditions

412
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
to find our specialties

413
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We are all very familiar with Taiwan

414
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You may not know the number

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The world has 440,000 kilometers of coastline

416
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Taiwan's coastline is 1,600 kilometers long

417
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
About the whole world of the earth

418
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,700
One-fourth of the total length of the coastline

419
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,200
That's not bad, isn't it?

420
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,500
We think Taiwan is small

421
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,700
Actually not small

422
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,800
because of this

423
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,600
Our coastline is still in the world

424
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,100
can still be listed as our length

425
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,200
The second important thing is our Taiwan

426
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,900
Where's this black grass from the south?

427
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,200
has two tributaries

428
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,900
The mainstream is from the east coast of the Pacific

429
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,500
It's from Hualien and Taitung.

430
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,000
Yilan keeps going up

431
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
What about other tributaries?

432
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,900
from the Taiwan Strait

433
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,800
So what about this luck?

434
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,700
we are very rich

435
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,700
the resources of the ocean

436
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,300
then let this this

437
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,800
The conditions of our marine ecology are particularly good

438
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
For example, the earth is better than the earth

439
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,100
Types of fish probably

440
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,400
24,000 to 5,000 species

441
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,700
already recorded

442
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,900
There are more than 2,300 kinds of fish in Taiwan

443
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,700
recorded

444
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,100
that is one tenth

445
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,500
Therefore, although Taiwan is small

446
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,900
But biological resources are very rich

447
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,300
What's more, we have three hundred kinds of Sanwu

448
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,000
The doubling of the 2,500 species

449
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,900
So

450
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The next series has 340 kinds

451
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So this kind of style research is

452
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
we can play

453
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
to make scientific discoveries

454
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
basis for future applications

455
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then Taiwan's production and breeding

456
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, they are actually talking

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
From Zheng Shenggong to Taiwan

458
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Started to develop private equity farming in Tainan

459
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Isn't that very out of the ordinary?

460
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But also Taiwan's production and breeding

461
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Our ancestors were already very familiar with

462
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
can only use the resources of the ocean

463
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Cultivate such delicious fish

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So from 1661 to 1962

465
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
you see so long

466
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then it is a pastoral farming

467
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
More out of the ordinary farming and herding fish, etc.

468
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Then we start

469
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Successful technology with development above

470
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Raising grass lotus carp and grass shrimp

471
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Artificial link of mullet

472
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This technology was introduced in the 660s of the Republic of China

473
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
5060s established technology

474
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Then we started to combine technologies

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
corporate farming

476
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
This is Taiwan from 1970 to 1979

477
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,100
It was the glorious era from the 1960s to the 1970s

478
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,600
then based on this

479
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,800
So we know Manyu and Caoxia

480
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,500
Both call Taiwan the Kingdom of Manyu

481
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,900
or the Grass Summer Kingdom

482
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,400
Grass summer is hardly cultivated now

483
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
It's the king carved the king

484
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,700
But this is of course a sick question

485
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,100
then i mean

486
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,800
I remember when I just returned home

487
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,100
Manyu farming is officially the most prosperous time

488
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,200
At that time Taiwan

489
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,700
At that time, when Manyu was exported, one kilogram was

490
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,800
about 10 dollars

491
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,300
At that time, one to four was 10 yuan

492
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,400
dollar one dollar

493
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,300
At that time, we exported from Taiwan every year

494
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,800
Probably reached 1 billion US dollars

495
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,500
It is Guangman language export has always been

496
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,700
In just one year, the NT$40 billion at that time

497
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
So go to Manyu City

498
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,200
those rambunctious bosses

499
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,300
Taipei City is still driving this era of empty talk

500
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,200
I have already done a lot of driving Benz and VNW

501
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,000
what about later

502
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Grass summer cultivated

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
When going to the south to go to the shrimp pond, there are also double B cars driving

504
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So that's all the glory days

505
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We can't always remember the glory

506
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Disappeared due to illness

507
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So we have sick problems

508
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There is the problem of groundwater subsidence, etc.

509
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So we are already afraid to talk about the so-called kingdom

510
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But we are in this recession

511
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The government still invests a lot of funds to introduce biotechnology

512
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Hope Taiwan can continue to lead

513
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
In fact our technologies

514
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Especially in mainland China or Southeast Asia, India, etc.

515
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I very much hope that these new biotechnologies in Taiwan that produce and raise bats

516
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can go to these countries to develop this industry

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Here's the Science Development for Our Congressional Bloggers

518
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
the analysis they did

519
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The resources we just talked about in the repo

520
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,540
The resources of the ocean cannot be sustainable

521
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,740
Because humans overfill it, right?

522
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,800
Pollution, wait

523
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,040
Then I will give two examples

524
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,880
One is from this our

525
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,680
We love to eat tuna Sashimi

526
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,480
But everyone understands

527
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,280
When is the highest peak in Taiwan?

528
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,440
Where is this Sashimi?

529
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
not tuna

530
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,080
Can catch 10,000 tails a year

531
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
about fourteen years ago

532
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,380
Now catch only five hundred and five tails

533
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,000
This resource is

534
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,940
This decline is very fast

535
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,540
This is our responsibility

536
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,180
So how about technology

537
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,580
So in fact in some countries

538
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,080
in australia mexico

539
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,740
They have developed the only farming industry

540
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,080
We do not have such an environmental management in Taiwan

541
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
the only meaning is to say

542
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,480
When resources are scarce

543
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,680
Then this can only be developed by breeding

544
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,880
The second one is that the mullet roe will grow this year

545
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,180
the price is very

546
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,140
So because we used to peak at

547
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,580
At this time of the American League East?

548
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,980
I remember when I was a kid

549
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm getting better. Wow, everyone is so happy.

550
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Because every year Taiwan catches

551
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So that fishery technology is not very good

552
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Every year, one million tails are caught, and the material benefits of two million tails

553
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
There's value in it, right?

554
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Now the annual catch may be 200,000 to 300,000

555
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So like this year, there are almost 300,000 tails

556
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So the material benefit value becomes very noble

557
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
very expensive good

558
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Then it's resource-hungry

559
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But Taiwan also has a place to overcome

560
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It is the material benefit that Taiwan can raise a whole foot

561
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Raised for two to three years

562
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The benefit value can be raised to almost a sum

563
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Can be raised to 8292

564
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Quality is hardly grasped naturally

565
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So this technology can still overcome

566
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
this scarcity of resources

567
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So this technology in Taiwan

568
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That is, aquaculture technology

569
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Molecular Biology

570
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
What's more, the development of this algae biotechnology

571
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is our Taiwan

572
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
more important

573
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Can provide many of our needs

574
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So

575
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Humans just mentioned that humans will rely on

576
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
this

577
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
With the product as a source of food

578
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So

579
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The adsorbed ones are usually better than the road ones

580
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
regular chicken

581
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
This pork is more expensive

582
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
and

583
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
also many times more expensive

584
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So

585
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
economic development

586
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
The consumption of adsorption will definitely increase

587
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
so this

588
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
A statistic from the world's FAO

589
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It was 2007

590
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Everyone in the world eats it a year

591
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
16.7 kg of fish

592
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So

593
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
18.6 kg in 2010

594
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
About 26 kg to 28 kg in Taiwan

595
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We in Taiwan still eat fish

596
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
eat more

597
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
so

598
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This consumption is increased

599
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
but

600
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
fish eaten here

601
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
some fish

602
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Some are from aquatic products

603
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There are two sources

604
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
then you can tell

605
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The blue piece of the egg

606
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
yes

607
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
worldwide

608
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Doubts about compensation

609
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,200
so far probably because of resource management

610
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,800
probably it doesn't grow much

611
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,500
A little bit can probably replenish the amount

612
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,300
About 90 million metric tons

613
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
Doubtful

614
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,400
Then it's this piece

615
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,200
In the past, the amount of breeding was very small

616
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,000
You can tell it started almost 20 years ago

617
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
This growth rate is rapidly increasing

618
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Can you see this number?

619
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,400
8% annual growth rate

620
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
2012 is last year

621
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,400
Farmed production is 66 million metric tons

622
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,900
70,000 metric tons this year

623
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,900
So by 20 years maybe 20 years

624
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,400
The yield of farming will be higher than that of old fish

625
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
So this industry is developing

626
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,800
demand is rapidly increasing

627
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
so it's a trend

628
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,700
Just mentioned it is until 2018

629
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,460
Then farming will exceed the amount of catch

630
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,760
Well so these only depend on so although farming to provide

631
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,960
Then let's see where Taiwan ranks

632
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,360
Taiwan although we have a large fleet catching fish

633
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
still catch this squid

634
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
But we have limited fish species to catch

635
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
So even though we are like this

636
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,660
Taiwan catches fish all over the world

637
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,160
Up to 15 million tons in China

638
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,860
Taiwan is 850,000 metric tons

639
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,360
That fights against the one percent of the world

640
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,760
In fact, we don't catch much

641
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,220
But what we catch is more expensive fish

642
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,120
This is how much we make up

643
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,320
What about breeding?

644
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,560
What about us in Taiwan?

645
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,160
Because we are limited to our area

646
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,160
but what about our output

647
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,000
About 310,000 metric tons

648
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,420
Then China is more than 47 million metric tons

649
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,020
So this amount is very large

650
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,260
Then Taiwan and world production is 0.10%

651
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,520
So but we use small things to make big things

652
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,980
We have good industrial technology

653
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,540
Then let's replace our yield

654
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,540
So our quantity is definitely small

655
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,640
But the level of technology we have to present

656
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,900
So

657
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,480
So look at the world

658
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,500
Not only Taiwan

659
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,260
From the perspective of the world

660
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,300
This is the maximum yield

661
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,600
because oysters

662
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,380
It is only 12 million tons

663
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,660
but in terms of fish

664
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,460
The first one is mostly because of China

665
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,480
keep a lot of carp

666
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,020
3.5 million tons a year

667
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,080
The second most is this shrimp

668
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,880
3.8 million tons

669
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,160
The third is no abalone

670
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,440
is 2.85 million tons

671
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,260
Salmon is 1.7 million tons

672
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,040
probably can see

673
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,360
When your fish species are all million tons

674
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,920
output to develop

675
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,720
so so we this

676
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,520
exist

677
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,080
In terms of the world or Taiwan

678
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,380
Then it can be seen from the above analysis that

679
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,660
The importance of nutrients

680
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,440
so

681
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,480
this

682
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,520
Because fresh nutrients

683
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,320
output can

684
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,860
with your amount

685
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,640
So

686
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
More importantly, in animal feed

687
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,560
We often say that cost is feed conversion power

688
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,760
It is Fit Conversion Ration, FCR

689
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,200
As for fish farming, the feed is very good now

690
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,560
Some 1.2 to 1.5 kg of feed

691
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
1 kg of fish will grow out

692
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
But what about the kilogram statistics

693
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
this, this

694
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,760
What about this, this grass-rock sports animal?

695
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,500
About 8 kg of feed

696
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,100
Is it better to add 7, it is 2

697
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,100
But the conversion efficiency of fish is more

698
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Then, more importantly

699
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,600
For the identification of farmed diseases

700
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,900
Disease detection, what about medical technology?

701
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,100
It's quite mature now

702
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,900
What about research in this area in Taiwan?

703
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,100
A considerable amount of research has also been invested in

704
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,700
Well, for the health mentioned just now

705
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,400
and food safety

706
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,900
That aquatic product is very important

707
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,100
In particular, we mentioned that apart from talking about high-quality protein

708
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,100
This, this fish meat still has very elegant

709
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
collection

710
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
then this is

711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,200
There is no way to provide the meat we are talking about

712
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,560
So in terms of health needs

713
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,100
it is very important

714
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,360
so i mention one more number

715
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,560
just mentioned numbers

716
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,560
is our seed balance

717
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,600
then 1.2 million metric tons

718
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,560
Then there are about 300,000 to 450,000 metric tons in breeding

719
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,100
About 28%

720
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,460
What about the output value?

721
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,500
Taiwan's remaining output value is about 100 billion

722
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,360
Breeding about 38 billion

723
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,160
That output value accounted for 35.7%

724
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,960
Indicates the value of the rest of the breeding

725
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,760
Slightly higher than Yu Lao's calm value

726
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,760
We understand Taiwan's international

727
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,060
We farm

728
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,860
some of our status

729
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,960
After this pros and cons

730
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,560
Let's look at Taiwan in

731
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,760
Sorry

732
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,560
Strategies for development in this area of ​​marine biotechnology in Taiwan

733
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,460
Of course we usually talk about strategy

734
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,260
usually do a

735
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
Analysis of some pros and cons

736
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,800
digital analysis

737
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,400
Just now I mentioned that Taiwan has these characteristics

738
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,100
We are often proud to say

739
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,600
Taiwan's farming technology

740
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,400
and feed technology

741
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,300
The technology of the viewing instrument is carefully selected

742
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,900
This is not a problem

743
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,400
Second we have a lot of talent

744
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,600
The third one is that we have very close cooperation in industry, relations and academia

745
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,200
our chance is

746
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,800
We are able to develop multifaceted outcomes

747
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,100
including industrial applications

748
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,200
Applications in the medical industry

749
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Ours is structured

750
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,100
Asia-Pacific's Aquatic Total Second Center for this condition

751
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,800
Because regardless of mainland China

752
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,100
or Southeast Asian countries

753
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,700
They all went to Taiwan to ask for talent

754
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Need technology

755
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,500
This is indeed where we are going to develop

756
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,700
But we also have some points

757
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,100
for example

758
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Industry relocation

759
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,900
Technology integration is not good enough

760
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,300
insufficient funds

761
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,600
Natural resources are scarce

762
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,000
We've been trying to find ways to overcome him recently.

763
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,840
The third is research strength

764
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,800
I want to report to you about my research strength

765
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
is our laboratory

766
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,200
I went to such a long time for a study

767
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,000
in manor circle

768
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,800
Because I just said as the Generalissimo

769
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,200
There is also some burden on aquatic technology

770
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,600
We do part of the planning and promotion work

771
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,200
So our laboratory is of course still based on

772
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,000
molecular biology

773
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,600
economic research

774
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,900
to study important aquatic farmed animals

775
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
animal with pattern

776
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,800
then research

777
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,500
Then we address important topics

778
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,300
boneless fish

779
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,100
Grouper

780
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,300
and zebrafish

781
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,900
ornamental fish etc.

782
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,100
These are the objects of our research

783
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Then the subject will grow against it

784
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,400
Because of raising this animal

785
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,000
growing

786
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Speed ​​is an important source of determining its income

787
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,700
You grow fast, it has a yield and payback will be quicker

788
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,200
Second, as environmental changes and disease risks are reduced

789
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,700
So growing is, usually breeding

790
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,700
No matter from breeding to feed flowering is the most important part

791
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,000
The second is disease monitoring and disease prevention

792
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,500
Often breeding inside now the world statistics

793
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
About 40% of losses due to disease deaths

794
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,700
So the disease can sometimes even reach 100%

795
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,300
Therefore, disease prevention is very important

796
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,700
Ornamental instrument

797
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,500
Taiwan is a viewing instrument and is currently on the top of the international

798
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,300
still the most competitive country

799
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,700
Competing with us is mainly Singapore

800
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,400
Singapore used Southeast Asia for its Forte acquisition

801
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,700
it transfer center

802
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,800
We in Taiwan really have four to five hundred kinds of ornamental instruments

803
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,000
in Taiwan

804
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,300
That is exported from Taiwan

805
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,200
So we are actually more advanced than Singapore and more advanced in the industry.

806
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,500
Then we have our advantage

807
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,100
Then the question of guilt

808
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,700
Then I just mentioned that there are some unsuitable technologies to be imported

809
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,500
Then let this industry develop

810
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,700
The following are the topics

811
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,100
let everyone know

812
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,000
Therefore, our research topic will be selected from this excellent tracing

813
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Especially for those who have no national interest

814
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,900
The second one is that we build this technology of gene transfer

815
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,600
Then the third is the growth path

816
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,300
Low temperature resistance is also useful for industrial development

817
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,900
Especially fluorescent viewing technology

818
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,200
Our team does a pretty good job of working with the industry

819
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,400
That's because it's a gene rotator

820
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,300
So we need a suitable platform to build

821
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,700
It is more important that we do a good job in technical research

822
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,300
So let's look at this excellent

823
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,900
This is what everyone needs to know

824
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,000
any of us

825
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
You need to produce economically for this animal and plant

826
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,360
Then you have to go through preseeding

827
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,900
What about pre-planting?

828
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,460
Then you have to inherit the genetic method

829
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,160
that is, selected

830
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,800
genetic traits

831
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,860
Then your characteristic, for example, is to grow.

832
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,160
Wait, what about the different features you want to choose?

833
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,860
Then you have to go through its quantification

834
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,060
Then look at its gene, this

835
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,160
its this trade

836
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,980
What about the mark of this gene?

837
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,360
can identify it

838
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,020
as pre-seed

839
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,760
For example, if you grow up, you want to

840
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,960
fast growing

841
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,560
large fish

842
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,160
the fish

843
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:37,820
no fish

844
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,060
Then you pick the front end

845
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,560
That can grow up to 800g fish

846
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,620
streaming fish

847
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,160
then continue breeding

848
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,260
so you can

849
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,160
You can pre-seed

850
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,760
grow fast

851
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,260
big fish

852
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,960
Then you can produce it

853
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,360
What about the other inherited traits?

854
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,860
We can also pass this

855
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,960
this this this genetic this

856
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
mark to filter

857
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
that due to the development of molecular biology

858
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,100
This property of genes can be established

859
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,040
So now combine

860
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,800
molecular genetic marker of DNA

861
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,400
Generations of genetic variants can be shortened

862
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,300
That is, the time can be reduced

863
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,900
So in the past, for example

864
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,800
It takes 8 years for you to inherit the inheritance

865
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,000
Inherited markers combined with DNA

866
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,700
Can shorten the time by about half

867
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,400
So accelerated genetics

868
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,800
Allows the industry to develop

869
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,000
So it is the auxiliary relic that becomes the mark

870
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,900
there is a marker

871
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,500
In the past there was no marker

872
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
then inside

873
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,300
The old man who defends me is advanced enough

874
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,400
That's before you grow up

875
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,300
I have a marker that says

876
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,200
With this marker, it will grow bigger

877
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,700
So for this marker, you first use the firmness of DNA

878
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Then you can leave this

879
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,500
Huanli Next Generation

880
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,000
So by doing this you can also reduce

881
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This total time

882
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
so we

883
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
We cooperate with aquatic leads

884
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
it has the same time

885
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
These two body types can be different

886
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
nearly 50%

887
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So we use

888
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
For example, using traditional DNA

889
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
This marking of the RF LOP

890
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
it can be seen

891
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
this grows fast

892
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
use this two different

893
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Limiting beauty of DNA to cut

894
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The pattern that these two become

895
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Same as this original

896
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
it's different from total

897
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So we went after these two

898
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
This cut of HINF 1 and RASA 1

899
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
fragments of DNA

900
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Then you can have a marker

901
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
This is already considered traditional

902
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
There is a way

903
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Then use a markup like this

904
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
then you can also choose to say

905
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Why choose no national language

906
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
All-male stateless

907
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Because there is no national language

908
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Everyone says it's good

909
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
wonderful period more exciting

910
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
but there is

911
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
XY's

912
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
male

913
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
words with XX

914
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,540
What about when only sexual fish are together?

915
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
Wu Guoyu is almost four months old

916
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,040
He copulates as soon as he is sexually mature

917
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,040
So if the fish is not big, he will only be the next generation

918
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,540
That's a big one

919
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,540
need to provide all

920
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,340
All the energy provided by him is

921
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,340
Won't you go after your girlfriend?

922
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,840
so he grows big

923
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,640
so so say look at us

924
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,840
the quarter before the event

925
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,040
There are so many Wu Guoyu

926
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,340
Then they will all come after girlfriends

927
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,340
live with him

928
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
In this round tide

929
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,680
you have a chance to see

930
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Extremely fun

931
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,880
that now means

932
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,380
How big does Wu Guoyu have to be?

933
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:39,880
Wu Guoyu can be raised to more than three kilograms

934
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,080
Three kilograms

935
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,480
So I'm going to Jiaoxi this weekend

936
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,680
there is a restaurant

937
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,880
because tv said

938
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Wu Guoyu can become a restaurant's family

939
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,080
and very expensive

940
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,580
One customer needs to go alone

941
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,680
Of course not eating Wu Guoyu directly

942
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,180
He still eats class ten

943
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,880
Nine holes and so on

944
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,080
But Wu Guoyu is playing the main role

945
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,720
he just wants

946
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Fish over 2.5kg

947
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,500
He said that such a big fish is good

948
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
will be strong and delicious

949
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
really good

950
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
too small fish

951
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,000
Turtle meat is soft

952
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,500
After arriving there, it will be full of this angular diameter

953
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
And the fish is quite sweet

954
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
i mean

955
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
super male turtle fish

956
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
That's also sifting with potato marcos

957
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,500
So of course we've also been using the new Marco lately

958
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
is called microRNA

959
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
fragments of microRNA

960
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,500
as a new marker for growth

961
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,000
So we analyze

962
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,500
also get the new tag

963
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,500
can be used as molecular marker screening

964
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,500
related to growth

965
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
the second one

966
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,000
Because of the first rotor technique

967
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,500
like everyone said a lot

968
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
How to use it in fish

969
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Let us introduce to you

970
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,000
this is very beautiful

971
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,500
Because Taiwan can be said to be the only one in the world

972
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
the fastest

973
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,500
It is through the precise technology of fish

974
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,880
Trained from small chairs to medium chairs

975
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,960
even to large chairs

976
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,460
in various colors

977
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,240
green, red, yellow

978
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,960
we can become a beautiful

979
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,500
And very vivid new colorful world of fish

980
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:21,960
So goldfish eggs are not just for ornamental fish

981
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
We can also use it

982
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,560
If you grow faster

983
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,140
disease resistance, resistance

984
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,540
Increase feed conversion

985
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,040
basic research

986
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,120
can also be promoted

987
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,000
Increase nutritional value

988
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,540
genome research, etc.

989
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,340
All kinds of fish can play different roles

990
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,160
role of research purpose

991
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,700
Understand the technology of the new transfer

992
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,740
we know in simple terms

993
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,100
It is the color body of our plastid

994
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,840
you cut through the first known

995
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,400
you can put the gene you want

996
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,800
Put it in this plastid

997
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
into this plastid of such a recombinant BNA

998
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,500
So, for example, we put in the genes of foreign aid

999
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
For example, the production base will grow fast

1000
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,700
Or this epitope that we put in Star Qiannian

1001
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,300
Then there will be vaccines and so on in the future.

1002
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,500
Make medical protein

1003
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,300
What about after putting it in?

1004
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,600
What about this plastid?

1005
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:24,000
Beat into the egg box of the fish's fertilized eggs

1006
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,600
So what happens after the gene for foreign aid enters?

1007
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,200
The gene of this foreign aid

1008
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,200
For example production base then it will cut into this fish

1009
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,400
For example, this case is salmon

1010
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,000
Then it goes inside this dyed bottom

1011
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So because of the production base

1012
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Imported this salmon, it grows faster

1013
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
In fact it's already licensed to do this in the U.S.

1014
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,400
This genetically modified fish should be transferred commercially

1015
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,600
What about the conversion technology?

1016
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,200
I'm just going to talk to you guys very quickly.

1017
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
earliest start

1018
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,800
Started with this microinjection method

1019
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
The straight DNA just mentioned

1020
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,200
you load in very thin capillaries

1021
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,560
Then its capillary is very stretched 0.1-0.5

1022
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,400
microscopic glass needle for microphone

1023
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,000
that's under the microscope

1024
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,900
The DNA you hooked this pin

1025
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,600
Plastic eggs beaten to one cell stage

1026
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,500
Then you don't care about it after typing in

1027
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,100
let it float

1028
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,500
Next, the identification of DNA and the screening of its appearance

1029
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,600
Can it grow faster

1030
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,700
Or are they more resistant to disease?

1031
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:43,700
This micro-injection is not the most technical

1032
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,100
So besides this technology

1033
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,900
What about the second technique?

1034
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,900
because we know the egg

1035
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,500
It's an egg membrane and a cell membrane

1036
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,700
So use the film to create space

1037
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,500
Just use Electoral Polition

1038
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,900
is to use instantaneous high voltage

1039
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,560
For example, 2000V, 3000V

1040
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,000
Use the non-second method

1041
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,660
electrical stimulation

1042
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,280
electrical stimulation

1043
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,640
you put the indented egg

1044
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,880
Soak in the hands of straight DNA

1045
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
easy inside

1046
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,480
After electrical stimulation

1047
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,800
The cell membrane will fluctuate momentarily

1048
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,400
DNA goes into the egg

1049
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,440
So this can also achieve fast DNA transfer

1050
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,000
soak in the egg

1051
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,400
The third method is to compare artificial cell membranes

1052
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
That is to say

1053
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:47,400
We know that the structure of the cell membrane is a

1054
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,760
gelatin membrane

1055
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,120
The gelatinous film can be artificially made into a

1056
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,920
Pointing style is Legislative Shuang

1057
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,760
So this Lipson, we'll take the DNA,

1058
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,320
Plastid DNA is packed inside this Lipson

1059
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,720
So its structural properties are similar to cell membranes

1060
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,560
then our cells

1061
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,400
then when this, this, this

1062
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,240
What about this plastid?

1063
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,640
Then put it in this, this, this

1064
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,880
What's inside this substance?

1065
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,640
What about when it hits the cell membrane?

1066
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,960
We undergo either electrical stimulation

1067
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,200
Either or use, use this

1068
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,520
This PEG is

1069
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,320
The diameter of Polyacin glycol

1070
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,960
it fuses, the cell membrane fuses

1071
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,320
Then the DNA is sent into the cell

1072
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,400
this is, this

1073
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,520
It can be achieved by the method of cell membrane fusion

1074
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,680
What about this commonly used one?

1075
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,440
It is the method of using, using viruses, vectors

1076
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,640
there are some viruses

1077
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,320
it can

1078
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,440
Infection, what about the genes of foreign aid?

1079
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,240
Through the infection process?

1080
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,000
Then it goes into the cell

1081
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,920
For example, like viruses, Novirus

1082
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,960
Then it can be loaded with the genes of foreign aid

1083
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,900
So we can put the gene of our foreign aid

1084
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,360
loaded in this viral vector

1085
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,860
Let it infect this sperm or egg

1086
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,960
Then the gene can be transmitted in

1087
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,360
so there are various ways

1088
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,160
Because the development of scientific research can be re-applied

1089
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,960
But basically everyone is still the most commonly used

1090
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,260
with this microcolumn method

1091
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:28,800
Or this radio wave method to do gene transfer

1092
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,600
then in the research

1093
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Because of Yilie's research

1094
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,800
Everyone is trying their best to explore the function of genes

1095
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,900
technology that can be combined with genetic modification

1096
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,500
to study the function of genes

1097
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,700
That was developed first in Iliad

1098
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,300
Then Gene proposes several methods

1099
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,800
Then they are very useful in research

1100
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,100
Well, of course I won't go into details on this side.

1101
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,900
Nucleus method with Zinc Finger

1102
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,300
Or Titan's method or Christophe Cass

1103
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,800
These methods can all cause specific genes

1104
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,100
for example

1105
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,000
So which gene of your fish destroys it

1106
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
What impact would it have to demonstrate the function of these genes

1107
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
We use this technology

1108
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Let's look at the research on growth promotion

1109
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
what we know best is

1110
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Growth of our vertebrates

1111
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It's the regulator that makes the lice nectar

1112
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
the regulation of the endometrium basically it has an axis

1113
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It is the square base of growth hormone is GHRH

1114
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It is secreted by Xia's ball in the brain

1115
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Xia's ball releases these religion hormones

1116
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It is to release the base to the pituitary gland

1117
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
The pituitary gland talks about this GHRG4G

1118
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
It starts to produce growth base is GH

1119
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
After the growth base is released, it will be sent to the whole body

1120
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,680
especially sent to the liver

1121
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,880
What about the liver?

1122
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,880
It attacks this transgenic growth factor in the liver

1123
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,480
it also secretes

1124
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,880
that send to the muscles, bones, organs of the whole body

1125
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,600
So what about this IGF?

1126
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,520
It's been half a year

1127
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,080
A very important function of promoting cell proliferation

1128
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,280
So this becomes an axis for the growth of an inner honeyhog

1129
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,680
So what do we do based on this axis

1130
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,840
let's discuss

1131
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,920
So what the hell is Gross Hormone in the fish?

1132
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,920
to promote growth?

1133
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,920
How to apply its physiological mechanism to do research

1134
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,520
That's what I mentioned just now

1135
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,320
through

1136
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,920
The earliest of this growth base

1137
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,520
What about job transfer?

1138
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,920
into the mouse

1139
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,920
By 1980

1140
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,720
then it can make the mouse

1141
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,320
This Gross Hormone that accepted the outer circularity

1142
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,920
It's long

1143
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,120
It's this original this this this this this mouse

1144
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
two to three times as large

1145
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Proof that genetic modification

1146
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
The growth technique through gene expression

1147
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It can grow individually

1148
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So this technology is a dream for everyone

1149
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Then we can wave to other animals

1150
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
A similar technique can be used

1151
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
so this is

1152
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
the first to meet

1153
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
The growth of idioms

1154
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So they put the growth technology

1155
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
get the rules

1156
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
so at the same time

1157
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It has the greatest difference

1158
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
so big

1159
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So of course this should

1160
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Compliance with biosafety assessment

1161
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
their individual stocks are fixed

1162
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Hingel standard

1163
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That technique has been used

1164
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
the carp

1165
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
this big

1166
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
this is the original

1167
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Or Channel Catfish

1168
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's an anchovies

1169
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
or turtle fish etc.

1170
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So to prove a theory like this

1171
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
with technology it is feasible

1172
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
So

1173
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So we first

1174
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
also come

1175
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Look at this just-like guideline growth factor

1176
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
IGF

1177
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,400
unbroken growth

1178
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,400
Then we use this injection or oral method

1179
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,200
also prove these

1180
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,600
it uses it to compare growth factors

1181
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,200
It promotes growth without heal

1182
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,400
In terms of weight and length

1183
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,800
Probably more than 20%

1184
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:24,400
Growth and weight gain in ten weeks

1185
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,400
means that we regulate growth

1186
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,600
Nemi's system

1187
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,000
Can achieve the effect of promoting growth

1188
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,600
Then, due to the development of the genome research

1189
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,000
we feel like saying

1190
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,400
Except IGF

1191
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
Get stimulated by Brosch Hormone

1192
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,100
to promote growth

1193
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,500
Are there any other factors

1194
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,500
So what we express through our genes

1195
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,200
screening of the system

1196
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:58,600
Then we found a new growth factor

1197
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,000
is it coley

1198
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,880
Protein premise, the name is a bit longer

1199
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,220
We call it Provenaning

1200
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:07,680
Then this is considered Chinese after typing

1201
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,580
This granule protein will be expressed if it is

1202
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,500
that expresses what we think it has to do with growth

1203
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
So we're going to prove it's functional

1204
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,840
We transfer to this zebrafish through the elite

1205
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,600
so so live a carrier

1206
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,800
Then after elite transfer

1207
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,260
It is also found that whether public

1208
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,340
or female zebrafish

1209
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,200
If elites who exhibit this granulin premise

1210
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,500
words that can show

1211
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,040
It can gain up to 48% of its body weight

1212
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,440
Weight can be increased by 18.6% or 13.6%

1213
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,440
So there is a function like this

1214
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,300
So of course we're going to talk about it

1215
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,680
Mechanisms through which cellular transmission

1216
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,080
to allow muscles to accelerate growth

1217
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,980
So we also identify it after MET

1218
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
The growth of COVID-19 outbound

1219
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The second is disease

1220
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We know that Taiwan raises dead panfish

1221
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
is the most famous internationally

1222
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Vaccines for Dead Squid

1223
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
often die from viral infection

1224
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
in the vaccine phase

1225
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It is the stage of corruption

1226
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Most important viral infection of the nerve necrosis virus

1227
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So we check for it

1228
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Research on vaccines related to novel RNA

1229
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We did some new research

1230
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
neuronecrosis virus

1231
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Almost a vaccine against dead panfish

1232
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
in the fisherman's stage

1233
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
90% or even 90% will die

1234
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So immigration has always existed

1235
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So how can we develop healthy vaccines

1236
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
is an important subject

1237
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So for vaccine development

1238
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
becomes a

1239
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Vaccination is an important issue for viral infection

1240
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So this becomes an industry

1241
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
but you have to avoid some research

1242
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
fish immune system

1243
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
to be able to understand

1244
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So I won't go into details

1245
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
It really can become an industry

1246
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
then another

1247
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
People or pigs or chickens

1248
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You can keep playing for a second

1249
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It is very troublesome to keep fighting fish

1250
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
If you grab it, it won't collapse

1251
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
maybe it's possible

1252
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
under too much pressure

1253
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
so go to the body

1254
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
it cannot adapt to life and death

1255
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
So I must develop

1256
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
no injection

1257
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
is it possible to use this

1258
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
deduction method

1259
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So we have something like this

1260
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
so we put

1261
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
The vaccine is loaded in the

1262
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
This nanoscale

1263
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
This Lipso

1264
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Feed this zebrafish inside

1265
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
then we have this one time

1266
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,300
Then I saw this red and silver light, which means it has eaten it.

1267
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,600
Then after 20 hours still

1268
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,940
In those 28 hours, it will slowly go to other parts of the body

1269
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:08,700
place to go

1270
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,760
means that we use nanoscale

1271
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,280
this this topic

1272
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:13,560
then you can put

1273
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,340
through

1274
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,380
The absorption of Tibetan coins can enter

1275
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,180
inside the body for teleportation

1276
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,220
So we put this virus

1277
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,780
fragment of this RNA

1278
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,120
Then as the development of vaccines

1279
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:26,880
So

1280
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,420
selected a different segment

1281
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,720
Then look at its ability to resist disease

1282
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,780
So we use this intrusive

1283
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,560
the nucleic acid

1284
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,360
What about RNA vaccines?

1285
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,640
So

1286
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,420
if this virus

1287
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,460
to infect

1288
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,020
Shiban can do this too

1289
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,800
Its survival rate is 39%

1290
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,120
What about the treatment of the RNA of the Kouwu vaccine?

1291
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,420
survival rate

1292
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,200
can be increased to 67%

1293
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,500
This is what we are declaring

1294
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,280
can be seen

1295
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,560
new like this

1296
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,380
Development of Vaccine and Delivery Technology

1297
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,660
can come come come

1298
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But how much virus

1299
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:13,000
With a company that has this reduction technology

1300
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
comparative physical techniques

1301
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Simply put, it uses iron oxide

1302
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Becoming a Nanoscale Chef

1303
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
The chef can pick up the antibody of the virus

1304
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Antibodies will catch the virus

1305
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
So catch more viruses

1306
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This magnet is iron oxide

1307
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
When starting in the magnetic field

1308
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
turning fast

1309
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It is of course combined with the virus later

1310
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
it turns slower

1311
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So we can use this technique to quantify

1312
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
This technology must be used now

1313
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The thorough network method of immune nucleic acid is different

1314
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
and faster

1315
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
So this company it has

1316
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Or foreign virus testing

1317
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,300
The platform of instruments and services

1318
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
The third thing to talk about is

1319
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,100
like winter

1320
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,100
Taiwan is often

1321
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,100
No milkfish, no abalone

1322
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,200
This grouper is dying in large numbers

1323
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,400
sea ​​scales and so on

1324
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,000
what about this situation

1325
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,100
just because of the low temperature

1326
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,400
if continued

1327
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,000
heaven smokes above

1328
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,300
our farm animals

1329
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,700
Responsible for great loss

1330
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,800
this mass death

1331
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,500
So let's think about it

1332
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,900
some fish are ugly

1333
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,900
Let's say we know

1334
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,700
like a carp it is just very ugly

1335
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,500
you are still in winter

1336
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,600
So this one in the fish tooth is living happily

1337
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,900
so we think

1338
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,300
Like sea scales, without abalone, life is hard to see

1339
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,600
because of its genetic

1340
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,800
one

1341
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,100
So we try to say

1342
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,900
prove that

1343
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,200
which genes

1344
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,400
genes associated with ugly

1345
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,300
fish

1346
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,600
Then we filter through the genes

1347
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,000
transfer of genes

1348
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,100
and then prove that

1349
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,500
this

1350
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,800
which genes

1351
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,000
It's related to the unsightly appearance of fish

1352
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,100
Through this research we

1353
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,240
In fact, we can identify it

1354
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,740
One base acid for muscle beauty

1355
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,240
special form

1356
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,440
Especially the form of M3

1357
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,240
under low temperature

1358
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,000
it allows zebrafish

1359
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,740
improve its resistance

1360
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,540
So we use a graph like this to say

1361
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,740
zebrafish

1362
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:23,040
Wild cooking and gene transfer cooking this base acid muscle beauty

1363
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,040
bring it down to 13 degrees C

1364
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,740
this boiled fish

1365
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,140
it passes a minute

1366
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,340
look at its fish

1367
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,840
It barely moves the pattern

1368
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,300
that is

1369
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,300
Sure enough, there is no fixed file

1370
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,800
But the genetically modified fish

1371
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,300
This pattern keeps changing

1372
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,300
It means that fish can adapt to this low temperature

1373
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,800
So specific numbers

1374
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,800
Wild fish at 13 degrees C it only

1375
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,640
we measure

1376
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,300
Its length is the perpetual motion of 20 centimeters

1377
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,300
But genetically modified it can move 190 centimeters forever

1378
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,460
Indicates that it has acquired the ability to resist containing

1379
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,760
because it provides enough energy

1380
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,200
make it this movement

1381
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,760
As far as positive exercise can be maintained

1382
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,560
Of course it starts from this energy

1383
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,600
So we know that this fish

1384
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,400
especially the sea fish

1385
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,860
What about ocean fish?

1386
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,600
It's this OmegaSpray

1387
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,860
Very large

1388
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,900
That's like we know the turtle fish below

1389
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,160
Other fish OmegaSpray

1390
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,760
It is EPA DHA

1391
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,560
Most oils with DHA are especially rich

1392
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,820
So it has something to do with the anti-sea

1393
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,760
At the same time it has the function of improving our human health

1394
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,020
This effect has been very

1395
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:43,420
proved very clearly

1396
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:44,420
Sorry

1397
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,660
that we often say

1398
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,160
EPA it's twenty carbons

1399
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,560
There are five from this

1400
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,860
left this

1401
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,120
Kabocha Look like

1402
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Combination with five double swords

1403
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,500
This is the EPA

1404
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
to DHA is 22 carbons

1405
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,500
It N3 has a combination of six double swords

1406
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,000
So these two types of Omega3

1407
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,500
proved

1408
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,000
This is positive

1409
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,500
For example, toddlers

1410
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,500
DHA is very important for brain development

1411
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:29,000
or health care for eyesight

1412
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,500
also very important

1413
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,000
but for disease

1414
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
prevent neovascular disease

1415
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,500
Prevention of Excellence

1416
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,500
prevent slow cancer

1417
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,000
or resistance garden

1418
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
or anti-brainization

1419
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,500
Finally, there are specific numbers

1420
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,500
so the tv turns on

1421
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,000
Both advertise EPA and DHA

1422
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
U2 turned out to be interesting

1423
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I don't talk about which one

1424
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
what kind of sword

1425
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,500
Omega3 is about to advertise

1426
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
They say in Taiwan

1427
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,460
sell fish oil in food

1428
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,160
Is it to be bought or written

1429
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,240
it is in taiwan

1430
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,240
The other party is selling the third

1431
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,240
So there are many people who say they eat fish oil

1432
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,400
But if we start from this

1433
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,160
Get it from this food

1434
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,500
is more important

1435
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,340
then let's discuss

1436
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,660
Synthetic EPA and DHA

1437
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:24,600
Where is the PASWARE it synthesized

1438
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,200
then we're going to discuss

1439
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,160
Well this is already proven

1440
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,660
That is to say, in the liver

1441
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,920
to synthesize EPA and DHA

1442
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,520
Then also through fat loss beauty

1443
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,920
or go fishy

1444
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,520
Drive with this delicious food

1445
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,200
From this Sparktan

1446
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,320
This Nino-Legacy

1447
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,400
from vegetable oil

1448
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,500
EPA that can be turned into 20 carbons

1449
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,760
With 22 carbon DHA

1450
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,000
This N is Omega3

1451
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,460
So so we use genetic modification

1452
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Yanchangmei is combined with the still fund Meilai of different styles

1453
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So we set up different gene transfer values

1454
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Let it be able to express the Diata IV, Diata V, and Diata VI just mentioned, and still come in from the fund

1455
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,000
We use molecular sound, electric current to prove its existence and gene expression

1456
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
It's important that we measure the zebrafish we've transferred

1457
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
EPA DHA, and its intermediate EPA

1458
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
This is WallTimes

1459
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
As a result, the amount of transfer value can be increased several times

1460
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
It can be increased to 3 times to 5 times, which is probably the established number

1461
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
That's a published paper, and its performance is very low compared to ours

1462
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So we can behave like this to fish like this

1463
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,500
Gene expression we have unique place

1464
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,940
Then through this performance

1465
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,080
Then let's see if this can increase

1466
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,780
its disease resistance

1467
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,500
Just now has the ability to improve anti-inflammation and anti-disease

1468
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,180
So this graph tells us that

1469
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,240
Omega-3 job transfer language

1470
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,680
It is strong against trauma

1471
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,200
is the viability of the VIP infection

1472
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,280
18% can be increased to 80%

1473
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,560
So disease resistance increases

1474
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,120
Resistance to staining at 12 degrees C

1475
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,680
It turns out that the death power is almost 100%

1476
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,320
Then it can be raised to a survivable temperature

1477
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:47,080
So this indeed introduces the gene for Omega-3 synthesis

1478
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,220
Then it not only can increase the amount of EPA

1479
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,380
At the same time, it improves the disease resistance and infection resistance of the animal

1480
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,480
More importantly, our purpose is the future

1481
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:58,120
These transfers look like a

1482
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,960
Can we provide our

1483
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,260
EPA and DHA for good health

1484
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,160
So increasing the body would have no national benefit

1485
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,160
is synthetic without EPA DHA

1486
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,040
Will it be available in the future

1487
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,240
source of this

1488
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,540
Here's what we're going to do next

1489
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,460
The fifth item we are talking about now is the viewing instrument

1490
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:21,660
The viewing instrument may be more pleasing to everyone.

1491
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,040
The industry of this ornamental instrument in Taiwan

1492
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,280
Then there are currently about four or five billion in output value.

1493
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,500
That's pretty impressive

1494
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,000
then the industry

1495
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,840
The government especially in Pingtung's National Agricultural Biotechnology Park

1496
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:45,280
It is the center of gravity of an ornamental instrument

1497
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,780
then raise it there

1498
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,580
Quarantine clearance over there

1499
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:52,080
Kaohsiung

1500
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,880
Not by Kaohsiung Tiny Airport

1501
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,040
directly to countries around the world

1502
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,440
I hope that Taiwan's technology for Impression is quite

1503
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,320
In this officialdom in Taiwan, there are people from all over the world

1504
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:07,000
It must be in the hands of the electrician within 72 hours

1505
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,400
So so, this one like this

1506
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,960
This has production and sales in a park in a country

1507
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,200
it is a very important part

1508
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,160
So so such a technique

1509
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,760
is genetically modified from Molecular Biology

1510
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,520
It has been developing all the way

1511
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,480
So about 10 years ago

1512
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,280
this this this this

1513
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,880
As for the Taiwan and Hong Kong company, it took this silver

1514
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,560
As far as the green silver light, turn until the rice field chair

1515
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,680
So it led to this and this in Taiwan

1516
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:41,040
The development of this industry of turning straight silver chairs

1517
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,680
So what about this command company in Pingtung?

1518
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,720
know that we have genetic modification and

1519
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,880
this gene this this this

1520
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,520
What about the silver gene?

1521
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,720
Then transfer these genes to medium-sized

1522
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,680
For example, Angelfish, Jiujianpolou

1523
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,160
or

1524
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,680
This is another fish

1525
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,200
Such fish species are the most leading in the world

1526
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,080
And it has attracted the attention of the media of various countries

1527
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,640
just to report

1528
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,920
So

1529
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,040
Hey, it's so slow

1530
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,400
that's pink

1531
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,320
genes from coral

1532
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,000
go to angelfish

1533
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,040
then changed the color of the fish

1534
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,200
I'm not advertising for the company

1535
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,520
I brought his video

1536
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:28,320
so everyone

1537
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,520
inside

1538
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,640
to the point

1539
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,040
with different fluorescent proteins

1540
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
At present, fluorescent ornamental fish with two viewing modes, day and night, have been released

1541
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
in the exploration of life

1542
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Fluorescent fish not only have aquarium ornamental value

1543
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
In academic research with the help of fluorescent fish

1544
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Come to understand the high-tech genetic engineering and gene transfer technology

1545
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And explore and learn the mysteries of biotechnology

1546
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
in drug research

1547
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Using gene transfer technology to do drug research

1548
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Can be used in biological therapy in the future

1549
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
in medical research

1550
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Fluorescent fish can grow organs that glow in specific parts

1551
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
such as heart, liver

1552
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
To observe the evolution of the disease and the use of drugs

1553
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
is it effective

1554
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Agricultural biotechnology is a hot new industry

1555
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Estimated four years later

1556
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The global agricultural production technology output value will reach 63 billion US dollars

1557
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
is a new trend in global agriculture

1558
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Taiwan is appreciating the difference in biotechnology

1559
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,560
Strong potential and advantages in industrial development

1560
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,400
in government support

1561
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,520
and the technical integration support of the Agricultural Biotechnology Industrialization Promotion Office

1562
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,480
There will be huge business opportunities in the international market in the future

1563
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,000
OK so let me explain

1564
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,440
Computing from lab research

1565
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,360
Indeed, the industry

1566
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,960
They find new business opportunities to develop

1567
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,000
But just now the vice president mentioned that

1568
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,920
If this fish is still the next generation

1569
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:38,720
If he buys it once, he won't buy it

1570
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,400
It is more important to comply with biosafety issues

1571
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,880
Can not affect the ecology

1572
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,600
So for these unlucky platforms

1573
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:52,920
Required for applications in genetically engineered and modified fish

1574
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,200
And it is required by the regulations

1575
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,560
so gene transfer you run outside

1576
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,800
Of course it will affect the ecology

1577
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,080
everyone knows

1578
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:06,880
To be able to prevent it from affecting the environment and ecology

1579
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,880
in case it escapes to wild conditions

1580
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,320
so let's think

1581
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,200
In this reproductive line of the flower chair system

1582
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
what's so special about fish

1583
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,640
When the fertilized eggs of fish start to wear flower chairs

1584
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,640
it has this dead germ cell

1585
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,640
germ cell precursor

1586
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,880
It is in the early stage of this flower chair

1587
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,880
Cells in these PGCs begin to differentiate

1588
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,480
After these 20 days

1589
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,080
It differentiates and begins to resemble orgasm

1590
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,880
egg trough structure

1591
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,880
before the sex ropes

1592
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,880
It will be turned into a sperm and egg trough

1593
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,680
egg trough

1594
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,080
essence

1595
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,680
is such a layered

1596
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,720
so can we try again

1597
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,720
Cells in PGC

1598
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
or soft cells

1599
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,500
Expression of this specific gene using Molecular Biology

1600
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,000
If its cells can destroy it

1601
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
What about a fish like you it won't become non-hard

1602
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,500
But the female fish has to be able to get pregnant

1603
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,000
So this system is to be able to control the verbal

1604
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
This expression of this gene

1605
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So there is a kind of fish that can live forever

1606
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,500
Then do a specific treatment for the fish you want to sell

1607
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,000
performance with enzymes

1608
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
or lighting method to deal with

1609
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,500
So we develop two methods

1610
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,000
So let's destroy its PCC

1611
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
One is the method of blowing with enzymes

1612
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
we one this this

1613
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Make it not easy to dampen the beauty of the ring

1614
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
import into this glowfish

1615
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,500
So this blowing with this enzyme

1616
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,000
What about making PCC cells

1617
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,500
it will kill it

1618
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,000
So there is no doubt about ejaculation or soft tide

1619
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
or we express luminal protein to it

1620
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,740
photo sensitive protein

1621
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:04,800
it is irradiated with red light

1622
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,280
it will sharpen the free machine out

1623
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,580
also kills cells, soft cells

1624
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,980
So the result of our approach like this

1625
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,780
You can probably see the final result

1626
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,480
Elimination cyclase

1627
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,780
to stimulate

1628
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,680
normal female soft

1629
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,080
full of health

1630
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,780
In fact, you can see one by one

1631
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,440
But after soaking in this machine

1632
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,420
cyclase

1633
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:34,880
This is when Nitro Reductase comes into play

1634
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,620
Its metabolites let soft cells kill

1635
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,220
Therefore, soft frying will shrink and have no business force

1636
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:42,720
Bright protein is the same

1637
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,220
As a result, after the light is illuminated, after the red light is illuminated

1638
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,040
Shrink after soft frying

1639
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,180
This is a normal soft fry

1640
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,840
So in this way it can be achieved

1641
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,240
Should not control

1642
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,240
However, we also cooperate with the industry for unsuitable technologies.

1643
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,380
Inappropriate off-coder and normal help

1644
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,840
it is exactly the same

1645
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,040
The color, body shape, vitality, health and sobriety are exactly the same

1646
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,840
So we hope that technology like this in the industry can enter this market

1647
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,200
Just mentioned why GMO is doing this biosafety assessment

1648
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,760
Because one is concerns about environmental biosafety assessment

1649
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,200
This is usually managed by the Council of Agriculture

1650
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:28,440
In foreign countries, plus the Environmental Protection Agency will govern this part

1651
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,440
if you want to eat

1652
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,600
In the past, health was first and foremost the Ministry of Health and Welfare

1653
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,840
It is to manage this food safety

1654
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,840
Both must be eligible for gold transfer

1655
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,280
If you are an official

1656
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,560
As long as the Council of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency can agree

1657
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,720
If you want to use food, you still have to go through the food hygiene control of the Ministry of Health and Welfare

1658
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,960
Only after passing the test can it be used

1659
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,600
Therefore, these studies must return to basic research

1660
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,480
Then our basic research

1661
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,920
i feel full

1662
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,700
That is to say

1663
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,900
Doing fish research always thinks

1664
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:08,400
Fish research is relatively backward

1665
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,700
Behind the scenes of doing mouse studies

1666
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,600
but 30 years ago

1667
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,200
That's starting to see the zebrafish feature

1668
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,500
that can be used as a model animal

1669
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:18,700
So what about the zebrafish?

1670
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:19,900
It has several characteristics

1671
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,300
It's its plastic egg

1672
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,700
it is transparent

1673
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,700
So it's an outside mouse again?

1674
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:30,100
You can watch the change of its fluid at any time

1675
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,300
to the formation of organs

1676
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,800
So these two days the fish floated out

1677
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,600
What about when the first day is over?

1678
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,800
Happy to have some organs

1679
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,300
Like the heart starts to drop

1680
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:43,900
Then its blood starts to flow and so on

1681
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,100
these can see this

1682
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,900
what about the fish

1683
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,700
It not only has a short melting time

1684
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,500
It can make it soft every week

1685
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,300
Every week can send soft

1686
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,900
200 to 400 pieces

1687
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,200
so what time

1688
01:11:59,200 --> 01:11:59,900
Material

1689
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,320
I even extended this piece to primary and secondary education

1690
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,200
You don't have to kill frogs before

1691
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,840
Then it's cruel to do these floral research, isn't it?

1692
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,200
Now my name is Taiken Corporation

1693
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,360
It was developed as a teaching material for primary and secondary schools

1694
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:19,960
Do it with this zebra chair

1695
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:22,800
because we have to

1696
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,040
Are zebra chairs the same as people?

1697
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,000
This is a very important subject

1698
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,560
You want to be a model animal to study human diseases

1699
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,280
So in terms of cancer

1700
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,360
Let's say it's human

1701
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,800
Pathology section of this different cancer

1702
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,240
this is the zebra chair

1703
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,080
You can use this type of long way

1704
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,640
Then it's almost very similar to

1705
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,960
or this clinical cell carcinoma

1706
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,680
Its structure is something like

1707
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,520
The pathological mechanism is also similar to

1708
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:59,080
So the zebra chair was created to be an animal for human diseases

1709
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,680
Some kind of disease, I think besides the disease of the lungs

1710
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,660
Is it because it is a language that breathes with gills?

1711
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:11,640
Other probably you see these physical diseases

1712
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,200
including mental illness or toxicity

1713
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,800
Dr. Ma can provide us with good

1714
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,080
The material of this study so the new technology of these studies

1715
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,960
Functional research and development have also constructed a very complete

1716
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:31,920
Academia Sinica takes the lead in developing different technologies in China

1717
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,920
Reporting to you means that Congress will support it.

1718
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,120
Our Academia Sinica built a core facility for horse medicine

1719
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:42,420
So we use the core of Academia Sinica

1720
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:47,080
Like a laboratory in Taiwan that helps horse medicine do research

1721
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,760
We counted 110

1722
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,260
that's quite a lot

1723
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:58,420
We feel that there are so many research teams like this in Taiwan

1724
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,180
is it possible

1725
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It can be used to present our Taiwan application on the neighbor’s house

1726
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:05,800
Is that actually

1727
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,440
In fact there is already this system

1728
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:13,300
Intervention as a drug screen using zebrafish

1729
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,840
Then these foreign laboratories

1730
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,000
Or the pharmaceutical company has already done

1731
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,600
There is no way this small Taiwanese kitchen can do it

1732
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,840
This high-throughput screening

1733
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,940
Usually, our drug screening is to use cells to screen

1734
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,900
its efficacy or toxicity test

1735
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,300
Then jump to the mouse experiment

1736
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,600
But the cost of experimenting with this intermediate mouse is very high

1737
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,800
And the requirements for animal support are also very strict.

1738
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,500
So now I have a new idea

1739
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,200
from cell culture screening

1740
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,600
Before entering the experimental animal screening of mice

1741
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,800
can help barbarian fish can intervene

1742
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,700
Speed ​​up and reduce costs

1743
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,700
So let’s talk about the object of this screening

1744
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,500
Say from 1000 you win 1000 screenings

1745
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,500
You can help the fish

1746
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,100
you take 100 tests

1747
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,300
Among them, the best 12 need compounds

1748
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,500
Only after entering the system of Oster

1749
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,400
so the system

1750
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,000
Zebra Doctor's screening system has entered such a stage

1751
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,800
So a couple of examples

1752
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,800
one is

1753
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,800
this suppression

1754
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,340
active ink

1755
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,800
Talk to Zai about this medicine

1756
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,000
this chemical

1757
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,600
this is

1758
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,200
it has zebra doctor pattern

1759
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:33,200
It is similar to the main plug of our blood vessels

1760
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,500
So the blood can't get out

1761
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,900
After soaking it with this medicine, the blood cleared

1762
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:39,900
So this color means the blood vessels are circulating

1763
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,100
This means that such a drug

1764
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:48,200
It is indeed possible to re-live the situation that Mo Zai said actively

1765
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,500
the second is

1766
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,400
particle means

1767
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,800
This medicine it's a Tyrotin-Kan's inhibitor

1768
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,300
That's actually a medicine

1769
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:00,100
it can suppress this

1770
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,760
anti-angiogenesis

1771
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,720
Because of cancer you also want blood vessels not to regenerate

1772
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,000
Tissue from cancer cells shrinks

1773
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,400
So this is a normal vessel aorta

1774
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,600
Then the branching vessels

1775
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,400
After getting this medicine in

1776
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,700
Some blood vessels are different

1777
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:24,900
Said that this can be directly analyzed by image

1778
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,800
Let's see if the medicine works

1779
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,200
This is an in vivo effect that can be observed with zebrafish

1780
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,700
So like this I'm giving two examples

1781
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:36,800
So many automated systems have been developed

1782
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,000
then i will say too fast

1783
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,300
Then our Sense is more interested in the liver

1784
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:46,800
Because the flower chair of Urman's liver is made by very few people

1785
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,000
in fish

1786
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,600
The second one is related to our Taiwan, especially the liver disease in Taiwan

1787
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,600
Aspects of the liver can be linked

1788
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,200
So we're going to do live liver

1789
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,120
Suspicion of the liver Before we have to find a professional liver

1790
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:10,740
priming mass

1791
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,540
So the genetic modification on our side

1792
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:19,720
The liver is indeed only the liver has pronunciation light

1793
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:22,280
This way we can directly observe changes in the liver

1794
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:25,860
Is it sick or not? The suspected condition is normal or not.

1795
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,420
we can discuss it

1796
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,240
If combined with human liver disease

1797
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:36,100
We know that if it's a viral liver disease

1798
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,920
Liver that has undergone thick liver and thin liver

1799
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:43,780
Liver disease can cause fatty liver

1800
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,860
hepatitis liver fibrosis

1801
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,160
If unlucky, it will become cirrhosis

1802
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,460
Liver cancer

1803
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,780
Is the zebra doctor in these processes disadvantaged?

1804
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,600
we will establish such a mechanism

1805
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,860
Indeed we put this

1806
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,400
Antigen protein of blood-sucking liver refining or nosebleed liver refining

1807
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,700
go to zebrafish

1808
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:08,200
when to observe

1809
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:13,100
Here's what happened to the mouse's liver cancer incarnation

1810
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,300
from normal

1811
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,700
hepatic fibrosis

1812
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:19,700
Then adenoma tumor and liver cancer

1813
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,500
About 68 weeks, about one year and five months

1814
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,600
The zebrafish system we specifically built

1815
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,900
If it is treated with carcinogenic TAA chemical drugs

1816
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:37,100
It is 12 weeks, about three months will produce this ACC

1817
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,500
If you want to turn straight to this ACV

1818
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,200
It is the core protein refined by blood-sucking liver

1819
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,900
About 6 weeks to 8 weeks to see the changes in the organization with ACC

1820
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,800
So the time is shortened a lot

1821
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,500
This facilitates our discussion as disease

1822
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,500
So we also observe

1823
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,900
It's the virus that we use to separate the liver from the liver

1824
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,400
HBX and HCP are transferred until the zebrafish performs

1825
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:09,400
We saw that its pathological section showed short tube abnormalities

1826
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,700
Then the short pipe anomaly

1827
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,000
ICC between us and human

1828
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,300
This is what we call this short-to-carcinoma ICC in the liver

1829
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:20,000
its unusually short structure

1830
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,200
the pathological conditions are quite similar

1831
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:29,000
So let's go over the disease pattern study

1832
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,400
We are very interested in exploring these mechanisms

1833
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,200
When I have a chance, I will report the details to you again.

1834
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,200
In addition, we have

1835
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,700
because our digestive tract

1836
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,700
So long that we actually wanted to study

1837
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,600
For example, it can be linked to colorectal cancer

1838
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,800
That research is moving bowel cancer

1839
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:51,800
We can make this gut only bonus silver

1840
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,700
we use kongfokou

1841
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,600
This is what the Chinese call Kong Fokou

1842
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,600
highway treat

1843
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,900
This risky technique taught by industry

1844
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:08,400
Then let's crosscut its long structure

1845
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,000
So we can see the long tube from different parts

1846
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,200
It is very uniform and can express red and silver light

1847
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,200
So the fish if it has been processed

1848
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,600
or genetic changes

1849
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,200
If there is a tumor on the long road

1850
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,600
These changes are coming

1851
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,100
So we can do these experimental studies

1852
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:33,300
This is the platform we hope to be able to express with the light of the digestive organs

1853
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,500
Studying the Mechanism from Digestion to Formation

1854
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,000
we pass this

1855
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,300
So we have built this zebrafish

1856
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,900
It is red and silver light

1857
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,000
Dry Tibet is green and silver light

1858
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
the same fish again

1859
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,200
so we can study their two different organs

1860
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,800
The relationship between interaction and disease

1861
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,300
I'll finish speaking in about ten minutes, okay?

1862
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,700
We will then

1863
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:55,000
then industrial innovation

1864
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,100
this is the government

1865
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:59,000
then please let me take charge of this project

1866
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,100
the adoption of agricultural biotechnology

1867
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,160
Promote programs wishing to bring academic research

1868
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:03,760
Can be imported into the industry

1869
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,160
The needs of industry can allow academia to interact

1870
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:12,240
So this plan starts from an innovative productization platform

1871
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,000
We are doing both with commoditization

1872
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,600
We, the Chinese and British communities, are responsible

1873
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,800
There are various parts to come together to participate

1874
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,400
We have a calibration focus in aquatic products

1875
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,400
Just mentioned again and again is

1876
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,960
Grouper, Taiwan sea bream, ornamental fish and shrimp are our focus

1877
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,400
So there are a lot of successful

1878
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,960
Through plan matchmaking and plan transfer

1879
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,200
There are many successful cases to carry out

1880
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,760
The grouper industry

1881
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,560
There is also the industry chain of sea bream

1882
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,920
Industrial chain of ornamental fish

1883
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,960
There are already successful companies in the shrimp industry chain

1884
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,920
or start making money

1885
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,400
So I'll let it pass quickly on my side

1886
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:00,240
So, for example, this one just talked about molecular markers

1887
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,160
Just mentioned there are several techniques to perform

1888
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:08,100
Like in addition to the research results of our laboratory

1889
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,200
we also see

1890
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:14,200
We have combined one of Taiwan's largest companies that export products

1891
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,600
And Taiwan is number one and number two

1892
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,400
Belonging to all feed companies

1893
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:19,960
to bring them together

1894
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:22,800
A company, a feed company, let it raise fish

1895
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,800
Then this accompanying product company

1896
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:28,160
It will be processed and exported to the world

1897
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:35,960
Therefore, Taiwan Eagle can be established to internationalize its products

1898
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,960
You can learn about companies like this

1899
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,960
Big grower he told me

1900
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,560
He employs more than 1,000 people abroad

1901
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,760
The talents we train in Taiwan are no better than others

1902
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,760
So it can be seen how big the industry they see

1903
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:59,760
The following aspect has this technique from detecting

1904
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,220
The disease agrees that he is also close

1905
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:07,800
as well as with Rakyo Marine, which makes the instruments.

1906
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:10,120
Nazang Nanya did very well

1907
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,500
I just talked about the technology that shouldn't be

1908
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,840
our continuous development

1909
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,600
This is the technology of the fluorescent chair

1910
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,200
So let's talk about this technology in particular.

1911
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,200
Russian Academy of Sciences

1912
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,100
In the past few years, the Chinese Academy has also booked a cooperative project

1913
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:24,920
he saw and said

1914
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,120
My deep sea club wants to build a marine museum

1915
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:31,120
In particular, Taiwan's ornamental instruments will be displayed

1916
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,920
Because seeing Taiwan's innovative technology

1917
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,920
Vaccines Against Emergencies

1918
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,320
Detection Reagent

1919
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:46,920
This technology can use immune weight gain as a data additive

1920
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,320
Let's take on this again to talk about his development

1921
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,720
He is only the five companies involved in this plan

1922
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,920
we count for him

1923
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:59,720
His transfer income has exceeded 50 million

1924
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,440
So it can create a lot of output value

1925
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,960
So we hope that such technology can be biased to the

1926
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,040
Can be applied in markets all over the world

1927
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,240
augmentation is data

1928
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:13,440
Transfer and processing

1929
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,880
DHA is cultured in the early column

1930
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,840
This is also the technology achieved by Weidan Company

1931
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,080
it has been certified

1932
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,640
Many foreign manufacturers have come to Weidan to say

1933
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,640
You are producing DHA very well

1934
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,240
Cultivated and extracted from the early column

1935
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,280
So it has become an industry

1936
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,040
Collagen

1937
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,840
is my past student

1938
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,320
his own company

1939
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,480
he does diabetic couple

1940
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:40,080
to apply the growth of entertainment thus

1941
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,600
Can be used as a couple with diabetes

1942
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,080
I have entered clinical trials

1943
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,280
further

1944
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,520
turn into medicine

1945
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,080
We also work with this company

1946
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,120
Never Too Much Neighbors

1947
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:57,880
can be extracted

1948
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,880
Can make successful angle mold

1949
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,460
What about this technique?

1950
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:02,580
we are training him

1951
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:05,740
We want to raise more than 3 kg of five countries fish

1952
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:07,580
The scales are over and we've seen it

1953
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,280
Then they plan to compete with Germany this year

1954
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:13,580
Clinical trials at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Cologne

1955
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,380
Then we hope that if this works out,

1956
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,740
to human health

1957
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,580
This should be of great help

1958
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:21,420
So you can't imagine saying

1959
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,420
How can fish things be used by people?

1960
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:27,000
That's because of the collagen in fish scales

1961
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,700
it is most like a person

1962
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,700
The first, the second, fish and man

1963
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,500
it has no common infectious disease

1964
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,400
It's a virus

1965
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,000
So its safety is higher than other animal sources

1966
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
So they have this consideration

1967
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Then as cosmetics etc.

1968
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,200
The third is our aquatic products

1969
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,000
We often go abroad

1970
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,700
Although the government has various regulations

1971
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,900
We have production and sales experience

1972
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,200
There is also CAS certification

1973
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:00,200
Some

1974
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:08,700
Only then can ordinary people and consumers be able to use it domestically

1975
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,700
But there are different certifications in foreign countries

1976
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,400
For example, the European Union has ASC certification

1977
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:20,400
North America is also this Europe and the United States, it has its BAP certification

1978
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:25,000
Then our certification is still not up to their certification standards

1979
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:29,500
Japan has JAS certification

1980
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:36,000
Therefore, food safety certification standards in these countries have various certification standards

1981
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
So our Taiwan certification in the past is that this grows fast

1982
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Then the cost is low, and this harmless substance can be used.

1983
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,500
But the international standard it requires is higher

1984
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:54,500
So how to comply with international certification is very important

1985
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:59,000
Another one is for the environment of the earth and for the welfare of animals

1986
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
for...

1987
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,200
social stability

1988
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,040
International farming new crown

1989
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,440
Not just Yangyi itself

1990
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,440
Certification of our grooming

1991
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,080
Have you entered social responsibility

1992
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,760
Have you paid attention to the health of the fracture?

1993
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,120
with his well being

1994
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,880
Have you met the food safety requirements

1995
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,840
Have you caused damage to the environment

1996
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,200
Do you meet the standards of the green industry

1997
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,640
Wait for these certifications to be added one by one

1998
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,360
So we hope that Taiwan's industry

1999
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,200
Can have an international perspective

2000
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,920
In order to maintain the invincible position of interests

2001
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,640
Just mentioned these different national certifications

2002
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,160
The strictest ones seem to be the European and American markets

2003
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:49,800
So we need to get these recognitions

2004
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:53,520
our chance is there

2005
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,400
Finally, because of the proposed marine biotechnology

2006
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:00,120
Research on the development of industry for us in Taiwan

2007
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,300
Taiwan's future is very important

2008
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:07,840
So our colleagues in many domestic academic circles

2009
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,500
under active efforts

2010
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,700
We established the Taiwan Society of Marine Biotechnology the year before last

2011
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:15,640
So this society

2012
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,540
We did what we learned to do

2013
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:22,000
We are also willing to go to the Fisheries Vocational School

2014
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,040
to his teacher

2015
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,640
Bring them the development of new technologies in marine biotechnology

2016
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,740
I also hope that their students can participate in this kind of event

2017
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:36,340
laboratory work

2018
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:42,140
We also extend to the education of high school vocational education

2019
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:52,140
We will also host the 10th Asia-Pacific Marine Biotechnology Conference in May this year

2020
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:55,140
They have suggested that Taiwan has such a foundation

2021
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,740
so i take the responsibility

2022
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,940
with the domestic academic circles

2023
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
to cooperate

2024
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
So our positioning is this theme

2025
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
not only science

2026
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Our new challenges to food, medicine, energy and the environment

2027
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
is the subject of our discussion

2028
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Then in the end, we have to deal with our Taiwan

2029
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
What is the prospect of the next life

2030
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
So

2031
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
run back

2032
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Sorry

2033
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
we run back

2034
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
because of time

2035
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I hope this is OK

2036
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
so the first

2037
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Although we are with what we eat every day

2038
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
eat well

2039
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
eat healthy

2040
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,000
eat well

2041
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
This is very important

2042
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
so i often say

2043
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
we eat delicious food

2044
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Or delicious aquatic products

2045
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
all feel very happy

2046
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
People of this generation are better than those of 50 years ago

2047
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
we are the same

2048
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
people who only live in Taiwan

2049
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So happy

2050
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,460
too much, right?

2051
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,760
you see it so

2052
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,620
Look at this from snapper, snapper fillet, eel

2053
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:07,000
right this eel

2054
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
this perch this oyster this mullet roe

2055
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Grass Shrimp Grouper Milkfish

2056
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,720
soup mound toad toad

2057
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:16,920
everything, right?

2058
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:19,960
very happy very happy

2059
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,000
Some people used to eat these

2060
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,260
So our last hope is

2061
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,680
our marine living resources

2062
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,680
We must explore through research

2063
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,180
and understand it

2064
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:39,680
find it this feature

2065
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,380
find its mechanism

2066
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:44,180
find it this function

2067
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:46,680
So use biotechnology

2068
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,460
sustainable development of marine biological resources

2069
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:51,060
we can achieve this

2070
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:56,380
We humans live on this earth

2071
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:59,380
Only then can it be very evil

2072
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,680
There are conditions for this development

2073
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:08,140
To maintain the food and health of such a large population

2074
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:12,040
Well this wishes all his distinguished guests

2075
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,860
Then everyone is healthy and happy

2076
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,960
so auspicious

2077
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,160
Then we hope that our ocean Taiwan

2078
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,920
just active perpetual

2079
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,000
Then I'll come here with you all to make a conclusion.

2080
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,000
thank you all

2081
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
We are very grateful to researcher Wu Teping

2082
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Secretary-General Wu gave us this brilliant speech

2083
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
There is a section on this one about aquatic biotechnology

2084
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
That's because the content is quite substantial

2085
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:44,000
so maybe some of you in the audience

2086
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
the audience is not very clear

2087
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
so if there are some problems

2088
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
we can ask

2089
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,000
that if there is

2090
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,000
please raise your hand

2091
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
And then here's the microphone press the green part

2092
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
this gentleman please

2093
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Thanks

2094
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Thanks

2095
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Teacher Wu's very wonderful speech

2096
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
There was a place that was very impressive just now

2097
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
That is, Mr. Wu is not just studying

2098
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Moreover, it is also noted that the business needs to protect and obtain

2099
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So there is research on this issue of not shipping politics

2100
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
but i thought of saying

2101
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
we except this

2102
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
But besides this technology, Mr. Wu

2103
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
There are also fluorescent fish

2104
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Do cornea again

2105
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
and nutritious

2106
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
anti-disease

2107
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
immune to disease

2108
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
many techniques

2109
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
None of these technologies seem to

2110
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Protect it like Buyunzheng

2111
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,000
That is to say

2112
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
We sell light fish abroad

2113
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
people can't reproduce

2114
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
buy from us again

2115
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
But the recent corneal technology

2116
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
anti-disease technology

2117
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,000
anticancer technology

2118
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
anti virus technology

2119
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
It seems that there is no protection

2120
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I just want to ask

2121
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
we taiwan

2122
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Even Mr. Wu's own technology

2123
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
The protection against the outflow of technology

2124
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
is there any way

2125
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
or measures

2126
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Thanks

2127
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Thanks

2128
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Thanks

2129
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,500
The question we ask is that

2130
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:04,160
How to protect the technology we develop

2131
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:05,760
Our biggest concern is exodus

2132
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,000
good technique good seed outflow

2133
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,660
I can't come back after going out

2134
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:12,000
Instead, it arrived in Taiwan, right?

2135
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,500
What about this situation?

2136
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:16,460
Agriculture, forestry, fishery and animal husbandry have all happened

2137
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,660
then this so

2138
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:19,960
one is to say

2139
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:21,160
what about these technologies

2140
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:24,260
If able to have patent protection

2141
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:26,260
Then we all encourage the industry to say

2142
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:29,700
Only those with patent protection will give priority to doing calculations

2143
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,400
So this technique

2144
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,900
after it turns around

2145
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:35,500
What about the technology of its industry?

2146
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,300
not easy to lose

2147
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:38,200
just not easy

2148
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,600
People may be able to counterfeit

2149
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,600
But what about our cooperation in Taiwan?

2150
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,000
not a one time cooperation

2151
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,400
It is attribute forward cooperation

2152
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,500
So work with the industry

2153
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,300
industry-leading technology

2154
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:52,900
So we are standing here

2155
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,800
Foundations for Pleasant Research

2156
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,100
come work with it

2157
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,200
So part of the industry

2158
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:00,300
We all let the industry pay attention to the development of the district

2159
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,400
So it is very important to obtain a patent

2160
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:11,000
The second is to say that the past patents are all patents

2161
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,560
So for example, will you predict

2162
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:18,960
But your detection of the disease, the development of a disease vaccine

2163
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:21,760
or additives to test materials, etc.

2164
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,560
We hope that these key technologies will be integrated

2165
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:27,640
For example, for this Shiban chair

2166
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:32,760
We start from the detection of pre-total disease

2167
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,560
then vaccine development

2168
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,600
Then special samples

2169
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,640
and breeding environment

2170
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:42,240
We need to integrate several technologies together

2171
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,760
system integration

2172
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,320
So if you are just a technical vent

2173
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,400
He can't compete with Taiwan abroad

2174
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:54,760
Therefore, the integration of technology is important for the protection of our Taiwan technology

2175
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:56,320
is very important

2176
01:34:56,320 --> 01:35:00,160
So this piece must become

2177
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:00,920
teamwork

2178
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:02,600
So we just mentioned a few examples

2179
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,400
It was promoted in our fancy office

2180
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,600
For example, Dachangcheng and Jiafeng

2181
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,660
These are two companies with different business objectives

2182
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:12,300
It has different technical expertise

2183
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:13,600
plus academia collaboration

2184
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,300
Although it is tied together

2185
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,100
So if this is the case

2186
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:20,200
You say my Jiafeng this part

2187
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,860
I want to go out and get it

2188
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:24,600
The part about adopting an aunt does not have a source of good aunts

2189
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,560
It can't be taken away, right?

2190
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,700
the same situation

2191
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:30,200
Therefore, it is very important to be able to integrate technology

2192
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,860
So we have to break through the past and say we fight alone

2193
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:35,000
In the past, if Taiwan went out alone, there would be no

2194
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,060
Now it's time to integrate the technology

2195
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,700
not easy to lose

2196
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:41,860
And it will be sustainable in Taiwan

2197
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,000
this is my personal opinion

2198
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,500
how does it look

2199
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,300
this side in front

2200
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,060
Okay, then there's that one

2201
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:50,760
Teacher Qiao Qiu

2202
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,260
ask the teacher

2203
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:54,560
to the one just mentioned

2204
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:57,400
Ultra-masculine nothing too much interest

2205
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,060
Then, since this is gray, adjust it naturally

2206
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,120
bred by the conditions

2207
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:05,120
How to breed this little female bird

2208
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,800
And that is to say, from a traditional biological point of view

2209
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,800
That is to say, the performance-related body is not as good as X can be involved in the body.

2210
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,160
won't grow up or die

2211
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,800
How to overcome this problem

2212
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,560
In other words, this technology is in addition to no abalone

2213
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,600
Is there another one that can be used as well?

2214
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,160
Thanks

2215
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:28,000
ok i'll go back to zai

2216
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,600
can you go back quickly

2217
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,400
That's the superhero line

2218
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,000
Yes yes X Y that one

2219
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,200
what about this

2220
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:37,200
it this

2221
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Thanks

2222
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:08,600
This means that all male fish are used to mate here.

2223
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,520
The male fish thus becomes pseudo-maternal

2224
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,720
That means your XY fish is male, right?

2225
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:19,200
It can use this sex hormone, type X to feed it

2226
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:24,320
So it turns into a warm tide, not just a warm tide

2227
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,440
So it's transgender, transgender fish

2228
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:32,480
So it's transgender, but it's an XY chromosome

2229
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:36,640
But it's sexual, it can be soft, there's sperm on this side

2230
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,600
So after it was born, after it was bred

2231
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,040
XY and XX are not half and half

2232
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:47,880
Only 25% of XX, 75% of male

2233
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:53,580
XY is still 50%, but YY is 1⁴

2234
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:57,040
So this is hypermale, so males will be 75%

2235
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:00,040
So Chaoxiong uses it like this

2236
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,400
In this way, I became this YY and cultivated it like this

2237
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:04,760
but it only has one generation

2238
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:08,600
That's why we have to return to the previous one every time.

2239
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:15,200
So this is just for breeding purposes

2240
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:18,840
In turn, I just mentioned mullet roe

2241
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,960
Then you want pee, right?

2242
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:25,520
So it is to make it turn bears into males

2243
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:28,960
So the whole teeth are raised by males

2244
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,200
The tortoise is feeding the bear

2245
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,600
So this breeding

2246
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,800
In fact, these technologies in Taiwan were developed more than 20 years ago.

2247
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,680
Well it starts a bit like Try and error doing

2248
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,640
Then slowly we will enter the import comparison

2249
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Biotechnology methods can identify

2250
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:46,680
Well wait these can be done

2251
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,200
am i currently

2252
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,840
Good Mr. Qiu

2253
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,680
Secretary-General Wu, thank you for your one-page research on Taiwan

2254
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,200
communism in development

2255
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Thank you for giving us this opportunity

2256
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Let's think about this question of fisheries development

2257
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
i have two questions

2258
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
The first is how do we define Taiwan eagle heels?

2259
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Wu Guoyu

2260
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I think a lot of people want to know

2261
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Myself I just said Wu Guoyu

2262
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
The second one is when we are studying

2263
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
while doing scientific research

2264
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
We also understand

2265
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
We are going to talk about the sustainable development of fishery resources

2266
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
can't leave the environment

2267
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
But I have been in the US for about ten years

2268
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Then back to Taiwan I saw

2269
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Because my family lives next to Zhuowei Creek

2270
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Then I saw the whole side of Zhuowei Creek

2271
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
It turns out that the one that can be used for fish breeding

2272
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
the tide environment

2273
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
has been replaced by that cement

2274
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Now many physique cases are made of cement

2275
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
not only so

2276
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Then on the fine coast I want you to see

2277
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
The so-called master of cement that is all cement

2278
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,000
something

2279
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,440
then we're going to talk about sustainable development

2280
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,940
we can't leave the environment

2281
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,880
So what I'm wondering now is that

2282
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,940
How can we change this

2283
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,200
the trend of this development

2284
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,560
Let the reproduction of this fish be able to

2285
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,080
fog as much as possible

2286
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,420
Chicken wings can't be completely fogged

2287
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,420
i wish to say

2288
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,480
able to keep some

2289
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:22,560
Relatively surplus fish breeding

2290
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,560
like a rainy-breeding environment

2291
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,100
we can talk about sustainability

2292
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,560
Otherwise we can only say

2293
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:29,860
From the environment has been pushed down to the laboratory

2294
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,760
In this way, I am actually the reverse

2295
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:34,460
We should develop outside

2296
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:37,940
So I'm here to listen to you today

2297
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:39,500
that's why i want to know

2298
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,840
That is how we can improve the environment

2299
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:45,340
before being able to

2300
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,740
To maintain a more sustainable development

2301
01:40:47,740 --> 01:40:48,340
Thanks

2302
01:40:48,340 --> 01:40:50,340
i think this is a big issue

2303
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:53,180
Our land and resources in Taiwan

2304
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,480
this childcare issue

2305
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,380
The first question is more scientific

2306
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:57,620
business issues

2307
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,780
What is a Taiwanese sculpture

2308
01:40:58,780 --> 01:40:59,980
because we all convey

2309
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,500
i think abalone is a cheap fish

2310
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,500
But the black abalone has a characteristic

2311
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:09,000
Abalone can adapt to fresh water

2312
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Can also adapt to sea water

2313
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
you know

2314
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:15,500
So Taiwan especially has red black abalone

2315
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:17,000
After pre-planting

2316
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,000
before they bring the fish to market

2317
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,500
They slowly transform it

2318
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,000
form in seawater

2319
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
So it forms in the sea water

2320
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
it has added value to the product

2321
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Not only is red turned into a vulture

2322
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Eagles are expensive fish

2323
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
The second very important thing is

2324
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:37,000
it's in the sea

2325
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:40,000
it will remove all kinds of earthy taste

2326
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
To get rid of organic pests

2327
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
The third

2328
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
fourth fish

2329
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
it will become stronger

2330
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
because it will reach the sea in pursuit

2331
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
So then what do we do carving

2332
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
You can make Sasimi

2333
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Why Ubalone Can Be Sasimi

2334
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Because it has been transformed by sea water

2335
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
so

2336
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
The head of the family said that this is called Taiwan sculpture

2337
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:06,900
Let everyone change their image and become this advanced

2338
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:08,900
so we get to this

2339
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,700
Especially this restaurant that speaks by mouth

2340
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:16,900
Its business film must have Taiwanese carvings, right?

2341
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,300
There are also supermarkets

2342
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:19,800
So where is the Taiwanese sculpture?

2343
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,400
This is a product specially developed in Taiwan

2344
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,800
basically it's a hybrid

2345
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:29,700
This is the Oreos Mozambica

2346
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:32,300
Not Oreos Nelotica and Oreos

2347
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:35,700
Oreochromis

2348
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:39,300
Oreos and Nelotica are hybrids

2349
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:45,900
Then the purpose of its hybridization is to produce the offspring of this all-bear

2350
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,600
so it's not treated with hormones

2351
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:50,200
it is hybridized

2352
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:51,800
Second your question is very good

2353
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:55,300
That is to say, the river bank and coast of Taiwan

2354
01:42:55,300 --> 01:43:00,000
So for this some protection proposals

2355
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,840
Huang Hong and so on are forced by Ba Zhang's phone call.

2356
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,840
The proposal is to combine and assemble

2357
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,840
Well, I think if the Taiwan government is determined

2358
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:14,640
The first one is to restore the ecological engineering method

2359
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,640
That is to say, your verification case is to

2360
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:20,260
There is no way to fully return to nature

2361
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:23,840
It is a quasi-ecological environment to be exposed

2362
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,440
That is to say, no hard cement blocks

2363
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:27,840
this way to do this

2364
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,840
step by step i saw

2365
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:32,440
Maybe Mr. Qiu is from Neia

2366
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:33,800
I can't talk nonsense

2367
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:36,940
For example, using stones of different sizes

2368
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:41,900
Then it is similar to returning to the state of the river

2369
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,800
so let it suck

2370
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,000
Let these original aquatic organisms fish and shrimp be classed

2371
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:56,680
It has four environments that allow it to survive

2372
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:57,880
Then this environment is subject to

2373
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:00,040
The second most important thing is not to pollute

2374
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,420
man-made pollution factory pollution

2375
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:04,720
Pollution of this household etc.

2376
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:05,920
this can't come in

2377
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:09,120
I think these two can do

2378
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:13,320
Of course the third item is the pollution of alpine farmland

2379
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:17,520
Fertilizer Pesticides wash down

2380
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,720
If these can be prevented

2381
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,900
Taiwan can recover really is

2382
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:24,000
I see Taiwan is beautiful

2383
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,320
To see beautiful Taiwan, no

2384
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:31,320
Taiwan that has been devastated by this

2385
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,320
I think this question is very important

2386
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:40,320
In this way, our biological resources can be sustainable

2387
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,320
this development

2388
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,320
Thank you

2389
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,320
ok come here

2390
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,320
ask the secretary general

2391
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:50,320
The genetic modification of the fish just mentioned

2392
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,320
that technology

2393
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:56,320
Is this similar to the genetic modification of soybeans

2394
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:10,500
In the same industry, we actually talk about genetic modification

2395
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:15,140
I often have to speak the real meaning from the original English

2396
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:19,460
You know that an organism has about 25,000 to 30,000 genes before

2397
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:23,540
In fact, when we talk about transformation, it is as if you said four years a day

2398
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:25,340
Huang Zi wants to reform, what is reform?

2399
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:28,660
Maybe keep the basics and replace all the others to be remodeled, right?

2400
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:31,980
In fact, in this translated noun

2401
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:35,260
I think the first one is that there is a considerable gap

2402
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:39,980
We call GMO in English is Genetically Modified Organism

2403
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:45,180
It is based on genetically modified organisms

2404
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:48,660
It seems that the eyebrows are too thin

2405
01:45:48,860 --> 01:45:50,420
I want to draw thicker, right?

2406
01:45:50,620 --> 01:45:52,380
It's okay to talk about modification, right?

2407
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:53,660
this micro

2408
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:55,780
But our transformation

2409
01:45:55,980 --> 01:45:58,620
Remodeling is like a revolution, I will replace them all for you

2410
01:45:58,660 --> 01:45:59,980
actually this

2411
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,840
Caused the public in our society to this

2412
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,400
The knowledge of this technology

2413
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,120
It actually deviates quite a bit

2414
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,040
The first and the second means

2415
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,560
We import the genes of foreign aid

2416
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,160
go inside a creature

2417
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,640
It's all GMO

2418
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,160
Na GMO

2419
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,320
The history of our human development has existed

2420
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:23,040
Human beings have been farming since the beginning

2421
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,400
For example, your kind is genetically modified.

2422
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,640
That transformation is better than ours

2423
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:30,600
with this particular gene

2424
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:33,480
change to a greater extent

2425
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:35,240
degree of self-exchange because of a

2426
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:35,760
right

2427
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:37,480
so we

2428
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,680
If it is to return to us

2429
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,360
8,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago

2430
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,400
our ancestors

2431
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,480
You said I ate all the wild ones

2432
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,280
That's fine

2433
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,120
is you to wild to

2434
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:49,680
or wild

2435
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:51,600
back to the times

2436
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:52,920
So our concept

2437
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:54,800
even scientific

2438
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:56,360
i often say

2439
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,000
When discussing or recognizing GMOs

2440
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,040
have science

2441
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,800
based discussion

2442
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,000
Only then can there be a way to truly understand GMOs

2443
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,700
In particular, I am talking about this life safety assessment

2444
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,700
that's very strict

2445
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:13,800
Then this piece is linked to this

2446
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,500
Why does the Council of Agriculture in Taiwan say

2447
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:19,700
Watch this GMO that is all medicine

2448
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:21,400
it allows us to do

2449
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:25,300
So why did we come to this viewing instrument

2450
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:26,900
We put this technology

2451
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:29,300
build a theory like this

2452
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,400
But just mentioned that the human population has increased so much

2453
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,000
right

2454
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,100
We in Taiwan don't seem to feel it

2455
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,500
food pressure

2456
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:38,300
but in the world

2457
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:42,300
20% of the world's population is still

2458
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,800
it is on the verge of activation

2459
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,300
Then the supply of these foods in the future

2460
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,500
I personally feel

2461
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:51,900
Humans still have technological development

2462
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:53,400
follow human development

2463
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:56,200
It seems that it goes along with the development

2464
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,800
When the human population is 9 billion

2465
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,100
i don't believe that

2466
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,700
What we eat every day is not GMO

2467
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:08,700
Because this feeds nine billion people

2468
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:11,700
Thirty-seven years later Thirty-six years later

2469
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:17,700
So this is the time to start a rational discussion

2470
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:18,700
have scientific knowledge

2471
01:48:18,700 --> 01:48:21,200
I personally do it from the point of view

2472
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:23,100
do this

2473
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:29,700
Sometimes our government departments will consider saying

2474
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,000
This will affect our export

2475
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,100
For example, GM's papaya is actually the world's leading technology

2476
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,400
But the Agricultural Committee is not the only one

2477
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,800
He said you planted a bad

2478
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:42,400
Foreign countries say I will not buy your papaya from Taiwan

2479
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:47,700
I think you use a specific coin to grow this papaya

2480
01:48:47,700 --> 01:48:49,800
You are the guarantee that none of this is leaked

2481
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,300
It was required by law

2482
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:54,900
you can't assume say

2483
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,300
because when you planted

2484
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,700
export can't

2485
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:00,100
People Think You Might Have GMOs

2486
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
inside

2487
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,680
How does this look like getting certified

2488
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:06,000
This letter of acquisition of citizenship

2489
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,000
I think this government needs to work on it

2490
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Here are some of my personal advances

2491
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
okay, is there anything else

2492
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,500
can ask a question

2493
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:18,000
yes come please

2494
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
i want to ask

2495
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
That is, the types of fish you just mentioned

2496
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
all belong to that is to say

2497
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
local small fish

2498
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Is that because of it

2499
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,500
But the love of the whole ocean

2500
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:30,500
it has some large return fish

2501
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,500
like you mentioned

2502
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:34,500
The tuna factory where Musko and the others make it

2503
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:35,500
that's like this

2504
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:36,500
that is why

2505
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,500
this biotechnology

2506
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,500
Is it possible to do the same

2507
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:41,500
used in the kind of large return oil fish

2508
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,500
Then if from a

2509
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:43,500
Research unit's point of view

2510
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,500
why only do

2511
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:47,500
That is to say, do not do the above

2512
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,500
OK, what he's talking about is that

2513
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:53,500
This is the top

2514
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,500
upper fish

2515
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:56,500
like tuna fin fish

2516
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:58,500
these this

2517
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,600
Costs involving the environment, technology, and investment

2518
01:50:06,660 --> 01:50:07,680
Why tuna?

2519
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:09,220
because tuna is in

2520
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:13,560
What they raise is mainly exported to the market in Tokyo, Japan

2521
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:19,200
Although tuna can be successfully bred in captivity

2522
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:20,740
But the amount is still not enough

2523
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:22,520
so their tuna is

2524
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,860
Mexico or Australia

2525
01:50:26,120 --> 01:50:27,140
they have that

2526
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,680
Fishing boat, Tuna boat

2527
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:29,640
arrive

2528
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:30,940
school of tuna

2529
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,000
this little school of fish

2530
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:35,800
We are talking about little fish

2531
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:38,620
This 35kg tuna

2532
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:39,900
tuna grow big

2533
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:40,920
they are tuna nets

2534
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:42,020
Then

2535
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:43,220
after tuna net

2536
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:44,240
after shrinking

2537
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,280
put in

2538
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:47,060
In this Xiangwang

2539
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,880
The Xiangwang in the sea is very active because of the tuna

2540
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:51,160
very big

2541
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:53,980
So the tuna from Xiangwang

2542
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,260
this diameter

2543
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,040
must be more than 50 meters

2544
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,780
so this

2545
01:50:59,040 --> 01:50:59,800
Taiwan because

2546
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,840
There are so many in Taiwan, you must be in a place without Taiwan’s waves

2547
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,720
Only when the impact is too large can there be a solution

2548
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:09,000
So they pass through this way

2549
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:12,760
should allow him enough room to return oil

2550
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:16,400
To be able to raise a fish like this tuna

2551
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:19,480
Then the rest is no way this captive breeding

2552
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:22,720
Then Taiwan was not what it used to be, and now it still exists

2553
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,480
We are raising sea sharks

2554
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,520
Sea shark in Penghu in Xiaoliuqiu

2555
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,600
There are industry players who cooperate with the Water City Office

2556
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,560
In fact, it was very successful

2557
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:37,000
But here comes the problem, that is, there are two reasons

2558
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:42,000
One is a typhoon, it may die and be easily damaged

2559
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,560
the second is

2560
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:50,360
some he wants to protect his fish from being stolen

2561
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:54,200
Some people in Taiwan say that night is the king of tuna

2562
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,400
where does he go to make water

2563
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:57,840
He said I was caught at sea

2564
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
A businessman in Taiwan said this

2565
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
how to say this this

2566
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
There's no way this security can do a good job

2567
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
So now raise Hailey

2568
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:14,000
It's only in Penghu, maybe Mintong is relatively simple there.

2569
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:18,000
There is no such transparent clothing in the sea

2570
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
The Clothes Festival is coming, although there is still

2571
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
But Xiao Liuqiu has almost shrunk

2572
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
that's a pity

2573
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
because haley

2574
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
It can grow up to ten kilograms

2575
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Moreover, some politicians can export Japanese

2576
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
There are still, but the quantity is no longer

2577
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
then as popular as five or six years ago

2578
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
we used to say

2579
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
The Council of Agriculture also hopes to raise Haili from Taiwan

2580
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Like this, this Norwegian salmon

2581
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Become a fish species representing Taiwan

2582
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Then it slowly evolved into raising grouper

2583
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
So now take the grouper as the

2584
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
our main this this

2585
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
a sign is

2586
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
But recently the problem is like this

2587
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,600
Xi Jinping slapped his tongue after coming up

2588
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:06,760
So originally Spani was expensive in mainland China

2589
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:09,040
You can't treat guests with Spenny now

2590
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,720
The harmful immigrants not only breed

2591
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:15,480
Our Spani is live fish transport

2592
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:18,480
is a live fish that is operated by a boat

2593
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,160
Shipping to Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai

2594
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:23,720
Previously only created Hong Kong

2595
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:26,120
Now it is a few ports out of the way

2596
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:27,840
But our price is underground

2597
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,200
So you are very lucky

2598
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,640
Spanney is much cheaper now

2599
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:34,040
I asked a few days ago

2600
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,920
like a normal shift

2601
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,560
The side price of one kilogram is only 180 yuan

2602
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:40,360
More than 300 yuan before

2603
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,040
it dropped the general price

2604
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:43,560
so encourage everyone

2605
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,000
It's all us Taiwan Spenny

2606
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:48,640
Our immigrants will not learn without loss

2607
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:52,120
Are there any other questions?

2608
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:53,880
I want to ask Secretary-General Wu

2609
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Thank you Secretary-General Wu for giving us a wonderful speech

2610
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,500
let's applaud and thank him

2611
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,000
thank you all thank you
