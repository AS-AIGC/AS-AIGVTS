1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,220
Employed Wangfu Dean and our

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,020
Please, vice presidents, ladies up front.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,820
and our Dean Wu

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,100
Dear colleagues, fellow students

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,260
Good morning everybody

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,620
Good morning

7
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,300
Today is after I take office

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,160
Organized academic lectures for the first time

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,820
Very happy to organize this

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,160
about us

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,700
An academic lecture by the former principal

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,200
The former headmaster is something we admire very much.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,400
a principal

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,240
Because he was in the 40th to 59th years of the Republic of China

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,900
Served as principal for 19 years

16
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,900
The fifth principal of Zhiwen School

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,800
He is overall in the administration of our school

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,040
done a lot of work

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,500
Especially the administrative system of our whole school

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
and recruitment

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
On the other hand

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,540
Thematic planning and cooperation with outside property rights

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,300
established a very complete system

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,440
Even the work of the China Merchants Association

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,840
He built it

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Therefore, the 19-year principal has contributed a lot to the school

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I am careful, everyone has seen it in my newspaper

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
People say I've been doing administrative work for a long time

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From the director to the dean to the current principal

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In fact, I haven't been doing it for 19 years

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I did it for 17.5 years

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So your ex-principal also played music

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Especially after I was elected as the principal

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Start to keep in mind the school rules

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Only then did I know that being the principal

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The president of National Taiwan University is also very lenient

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we can appreciate that the former headmaster

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's not easy, of course, the 19-year-old president of National Taiwan University

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Because NTU itself is a representative of Taiwan

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So not just administrative work in schools

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
in the overall political system

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Response to government Response to international

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
due to our old loss

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a very, very difficult job

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
so i'm really happy today

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will host

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We invite the principal to give a lecture

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then we will do it with you today

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It is our Zheng Yue'e who gave the speech

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Our Academician Zheng

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He is also our chair professor at National Taiwan University.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I am very interested in the topic he talked about

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because he talked about the evolution of Chinese characters

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Academician Zheng Academician Zheng I'm sorry

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
sorry so he himself

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think Academician Zheng's voice is

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't need to talk

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
everyone knows everyone

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
he is mainly in this

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Combining Five Points of Literature

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Western literature

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think he's a very good example of a domain

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In particular, he put the western space

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
or body

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Combined with Five Points Literature

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What he said today has something to do with this

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Just look at the evolution of our Chinese characters

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think today's speech is also very exciting

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
really happy today

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
especially when we passed a year

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It was very cold during the Chinese New Year ahead

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Today looks sunny

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sure I heard a very wonderful story today

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
once again i thank you all for your attendance

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I also wish you all a healthy, safe and happy new year

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
thank you all

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is what our central government posted about configuration considerations.

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In fact I don't need to rely on this thinking

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm for this

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
to former dean

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Our former dean is very respectful

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
all admire him

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In fact former principal

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
former principal

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
our dean

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Both have served very long in both academic institutions

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
13 years in Central

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is by far the longest serving dean

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So he has a lot of buildings

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
during his tenure

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Five research institutes were established

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
information center

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't care

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
To prepare another five

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Places like this human center

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So for the center to lay the next one

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
very solid foundation

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,260
That's why we continue to carry forward his contribution today

99
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,460
Central physicians should have the scale of today

100
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,060
I don’t want to talk about being in National Taiwan University

101
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,360
He has countless talents

102
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,860
Therefore, many teachers and students of National Taiwan University are very grateful to him.

103
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,020
Lecture by the Dean of the Former Faculty Principal

104
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,460
As for the Central Research Institute and National Taiwan University

105
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,300
Today we specially invited

106
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,800
Special Professor of the Chinese Department of National Taiwan University

107
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
Academician of Justice

108
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,400
He is also an amalgamated professor at our Central Research Institute of Philosophy

109
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,100
His achievements in comparative literature

110
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,060
It is obvious to all in the International College

111
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,100
I'm also very close to him personally.

112
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,400
I think we'll just leave the rest of the day to the Justice Fellows

113
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
come sing his academic

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,740
I wish my heartfelt love and share it with everyone

115
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,240
Thank you all, happy new year and good work

116
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,640
President Chen Vice President Huang of Central Hospital

117
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,140
Today's keynote speaker, Academician Zheng

118
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,940
Dear teachers, students, distinguished guests

119
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,640
Good morning everybody

120
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,540
good

121
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,540
It's a great honor to be here today

122
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,980
Academic lectures in memory of the late father

123
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,080
This year is the 43rd and 39th

124
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,840
Thirty-ninth time

125
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,280
For forty years since my father passed away

126
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,940
I think today's lecture has two characteristics

127
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,840
The first feature we at National Taiwan University are very happy about

128
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,480
And we have a very good new principal

129
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,280
President Chen Wenwen

130
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,020
We would like to take this opportunity to express to him

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Gong Hyuk means

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I also hope that National Taiwan University will be under his leadership

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
To be able to come here to go one step further

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The second is today's chief general

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Academician Zheng

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The topic he spoke was very definite

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Just now the headmaster said no

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But as far as my personal memory

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Because the last 34 years

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
america back

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
every year i attend

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
past 11 years

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Every lecture is a natural science

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and biological sciences

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's hard today

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Come to a Humanities and Social Sciences Come to

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And to find such a wonderful speaker

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So I think today's lecture

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
we can expect

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Today is the eleventh day of the first lunar month

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
remember

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,640
the eleventh day of the first lunar month of a certain year

153
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,960
haven't burnt yet

154
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,800
So I still have the opportunity to say goodbye to everyone here

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,280
I wish you all good luck in the new year

156
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,400
happy family, good health, good luck

157
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,280
Thanks

158
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,440
former dean

159
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
Then Dean Huang Hu

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,720
And our patriarch, Principal Chen

161
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,160
Good morning, my friends

162
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,600
really honored today

163
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,800
Can serve as Mr. Si Liang, the former principal of Gu

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,080
115th Memorial Academic Lecture

165
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,920
In fact, in 2007, I personally

166
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,080
Also met the former dean at Yale University

167
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,280
I really admire his demeanor and eloquence.

168
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,360
So today we can actually meet

169
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,120
I'm glad too

170
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
About the topic I want to talk to you today

171
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,040
Actually the main

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,520
I want to share a bit of my own research experience

173
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,720
it was at the beginning of the twentieth century

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,200
Some Thoughts on the Transformation of Chinese Characters or Chinese

175
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,400
So in particular, I will focus on the issue of heterosexuality

176
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
What about this question?

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
I think we'll go back to language

178
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,000
The underlying assumption that is often referred to

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,200
For example, if pragmatism prevails in the

180
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,840
We will ask what is the use of language

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,560
When you ask what is the use of language

182
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,880
Two basic assumptions emerge

183
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,600
The first is that language is a tool

184
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,640
When you use language as a tool

185
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,520
we imagine

186
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,160
That could be, say, a truck carrying goods

187
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,080
So as long as he can carry

188
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,680
any car will do

189
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,480
It seems that each session itself is not so important

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
because he is just a tool

191
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,120
the second will involve

192
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,360
The second imagination is language

193
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,520
probably just neutral transparent

194
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,000
like looking through a glass window

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
Because don't we see through it at a glance?

196
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,720
So in fact, this pregnant or existing

197
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,000
or the idea of ​​neutral transparency

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,760
In fact, it affects our daily life

199
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
a lot of thinking and judgment

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
therefore

201
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,640
If you think that the original text is just a tool for communication

202
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,040
is neutral and transparent

203
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,000
but you in your daily life

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,920
obviously often heard

205
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,240
why don't you understand my feelings

206
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
so why don't you understand

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
these things are not

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
Just treat the original text as a tool

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,280
it can be solved

210
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,960
So I thought I'd take that angle today

211
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,840
the one everyone knows

212
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,720
Thoughts about the original text

213
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
to go

214
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Then in the early twentieth century

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Chinese characters

216
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,680
Transformation especially in China

217
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,720
make an example to illustrate

218
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,160
for example

219
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,000
Everyone knows the second two yellow butterflies

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
written by Hu Shi

221
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,800
Also considered the first heart poem in the vernacular

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
what do you know about butterflies

223
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
In these two contexts of classical and modern

224
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,840
it's not just a butterfly at all

225
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,840
For example, the first one is familiar to everyone

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,760
Learner Zhuangzhou dreams of being a butterfly

227
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
It is the story of Zhuangzhou Dream Butterfly

228
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,280
look at the end

229
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,440
I don't know everyone knows that Meng is a butterfly fish

230
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,320
Butterfly is a dream for Zhou Yu

231
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,280
You know this punctuation mark is a posterity

232
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,880
It turned out there wasn't

233
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,360
How does it break the sentence?

234
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
it uses virtual characters

235
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,560
For example, wild, fish, fish, etc.

236
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,400
it uses these to make sentences

237
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,480
so you can find butterflies here

238
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,080
Of course not just butterflies

239
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,600
because it actually says

240
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
between people and things

241
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,480
I can communicate with each other

242
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,600
But in this butterfly poem by Hu Shi

243
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,440
It obviously really wants to talk about why the two butterflies

244
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,680
Because the poem was written when it was in New York

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
It's different from when I was studying in college

246
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,960
the apartment facing it

247
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,000
Facing the Hudson River

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,680
it sees two butterflies

249
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,000
fly around

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Are these two butterflies

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
number of two

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and causally

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
because how so how

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This perfectly echoes

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hu Shi himself is very particular about

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
In fact, language expression

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
can only be precise

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and must be precise

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Therefore, there must be a specified symbol

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
have grammar

261
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to be obvious

262
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
and meaning

263
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to be sure

264
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Here we can find

265
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Actually the word butterfly

266
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
in different uses

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
polymorphism

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Originally heterosexual

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In traditional Chinese characters

270
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
no problem

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
but from now on

272
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
there is a problem

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why

274
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's look at a lot of the background of the year

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
in 1933

276
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I found a popular science unique

277
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Science Pictorial

278
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
science pictorial is

279
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Science founded by the Chinese

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Confederate Sole

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Inside the science pictorial

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
One of them is called

283
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
where for example

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
treat the human body as a machine

285
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,360
The brain is the general management office

286
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,000
The mouth is the mouth is the entrance for the fuel

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And the nose is like the fragrance blowing

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
In this mechanical view

289
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,240
It has something to do with the entire machine civilization.

290
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,200
Also 1930s

291
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Louis Monford

292
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Inside Technics and Civilization

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,960
The most famous is the classification of space-time

294
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,280
He said time can be used in minutes

295
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
seconds, days, years, etc.

296
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,560
plan a computational

297
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,280
independent events

298
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,280
This is no longer the experience of the event

299
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,800
For example, we often say

300
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,000
That evening when the gorge was full of sky

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,160
no you tell me now

302
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,400
what time am i now

303
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,040
it's totally different

304
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,760
perception of time

305
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,200
And another example is the space

306
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,880
no longer through the relationship of things

307
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,640
figuratively symbolic or religious sanctity

308
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400
let's talk about space

309
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,880
For example, the most famous

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Perspective to talk about space

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,300
If we talk about space from perspective

312
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,700
It is the same as anything that is familiar with everyday religious values

313
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,500
Actually it doesn't matter

314
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
every time i'm flying

315
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
I like to see its route map the most

316
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,200
Then you'll find out that

317
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,700
Oh, this is how Jinweidu drew it

318
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,300
Oh so we are here now

319
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,300
wait to get there

320
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,300
You will find that this is an event composed of spacers and lines

321
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,000
Here is a chart of the golden scale

322
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,400
Indeed, people pass through this partition line

323
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,700
Conquered or rediscovered the universe

324
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,600
But should we be careful

325
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,000
Conversely, people accept that these squares and lines

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,200
arrangement and arrangement

327
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
This is when polygamy becomes a problem

328
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Obviously in 1911

329
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
General Encyclopedia Xingda Dictionary published by Huang Ren

330
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
can be seen inside

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
General Encyclopedia Xingda Dictionary

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,500
It is also a very important reference book for us

333
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,700
but it's very cooked

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,080
There is only one left in Taiwan, there should be only two or three left in the world

335
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,080
Then this one is now hidden in the National Library of Taichung

336
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,480
In this general encyclopedia new dictionary

337
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,920
It mainly explains all new disciplines

338
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,640
So it's called a discipline, like a discipline manual

339
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,560
For example, psychology, literature, gold studies, etc.

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
that's interesting

341
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,840
It specifically says in the preface

342
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,560
Leishu in traditional Chinese

343
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,240
These are too hesitant and vague, we don't want them

344
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,600
at this point in time

345
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,680
Definition and ambiguity become differences that must be chosen

346
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,440
You'll find it categorized and numbered by stroke

347
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,160
Sort by number of strokes

348
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
In classifying this mainstream

349
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,160
Originally the mainstream of the development of Western natural history

350
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,840
Then under this classification

351
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,600
we have to be careful what it might lose

352
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,360
For example, it may lose its overall structure

353
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,120
I give one

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
one example

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,880
In the whole ordinary Hundred Stars Big Magnetic Spot

356
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,000
There is no star magnetic stripe

357
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,880
that he put us through the stars might think

358
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
feeling, feeling

359
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,680
It's all in psychology

360
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,280
And specifically

361
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
through natural science

362
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,000
to understand feelings or feelings

363
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,720
But when we use star in Chinese

364
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,800
what he might be involved in

365
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,080
I'll just name a few

366
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,880
The star may be related to the star system

367
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,200
Xing may be related to Wen Xing

368
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,320
Because we know writers are stars of literature

369
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,400
when you speak and write

370
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,120
In fact, it is expressed through text

371
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,600
That's why we call Wenxing

372
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,240
Then in science

373
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,360
We know there is also astrology

374
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
But when the magnetic stripe of the star is removed

375
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,520
This series of connections is gone.

376
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,840
you can't see at all

377
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,520
Also in 1915

378
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,840
Hu Shi is a man who sees the extreme

379
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,960
What about after he went to America to study?

380
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,300
Because he wants to teach Chinese characters

381
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,400
then he said

382
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
we should have grammar

383
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,800
Otherwise it is very difficult to teach

384
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,700
So the previous sentence

385
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,500
to specify to be obvious

386
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
It is not easy to determine

387
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,000
It is from this experience of teaching foreign languages

388
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,300
So we can find from this data that

389
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,100
He mainly focuses on foreign language teaching

390
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,900
with Chinese education

391
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,400
In fact, there should be a difference

392
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,900
This is what I just said

393
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,400
There are a group of people like Hu Mingfu in China

394
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,200
or Ren Shuyong

395
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,400
In order to emulate him, he was influenced by the American Science magazine

396
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,900
Therefore, Science magazine was also established in China.

397
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,800
in this magazine

398
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,400
Hu Shi's article on punctuation marks

399
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
Published in January 1916

400
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
That is what he wrote in 1915

401
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Then this article is called "On Sentence Fighting and Character Symbols"

402
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,500
What he's talking about is actually the punctuation we use today.

403
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,300
You can find this issue inside the drug tomb

404
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,840
let's say algebra

405
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,940
Then this scientific spirit talks about machine skin eggs and so on

406
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,500
It's very very scientific and mechanical

407
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,060
or a technical magazine

408
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,640
What about the characters and symbols of Hu Shi's drama dramas?

409
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,720
It's actually a small part of all his ideas.

410
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,500
Of course it is also an important part

411
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,320
He once said that if you sort out old books,

412
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,140
Be sure to segment and punctuate

413
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,700
And it should be written like a mind

414
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,720
get together

415
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,260
Then one by one

416
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,300
What about this view?

417
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,700
In fact, Hu Shi is a sword fighter

418
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,460
Like I said he's very, very passionate to push a lot of things

419
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,000
So we can find

420
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,080
In 1916, he published On Judou Ji Character Symbols

421
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,360
I just said that

422
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,160
Then successively

423
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,940
Especially in 1920

424
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,040
Many people let the Ministry of Education announce the implementation of mind punctuation

425
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,360
Then Tongling National Primary School Grade 12

426
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,100
To change the language style of the national language

427
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,020
Abolish ancient Chinese

428
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,840
And finally more importantly

429
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,380
1921

430
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,940
He finished a very long article

431
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,480
two or three articles

432
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,000
finally published together

433
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,060
On the Reform of Guoyu Grammar

434
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,400
Since then, he has promoted the vernacular movement

435
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
to a more hierarchical

436
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,960
and

437
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,300
implemented through government measures

438
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,620
So if we're talking about a literary revolution now

439
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,680
We can't actually ignore

440
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,260
Take the forty or fifty years from 1970 to 1920

441
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,360
On the one hand, there is a world revolution that adds new words and new themes

442
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,160
But more importantly, emphasize

443
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,740
We have a literary revolution in grammar and punctuation

444
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,560
And if you go back to the source

445
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,900
It is related to the technological civilization of a certain technological system

446
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,240
A Value Framework Based on Scientific Machines

447
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,760
he compared to the traditional

448
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,860
re-established the modern method of reading composition

449
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,120
Also opened Chinese

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,640
and a new page in psychological self-reflection

451
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,540
often we hear

452
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
Literary Controversy Literal Controversy

453
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,740
But in fact, these four words are too simplified

454
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,880
why

455
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,240
Because we actually missed a lot of thinking and discussion in the middle

456
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,720
let's say the first

457
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,180
What I'm talking about is based on these few items

458
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,720
Let's say the first grammar

459
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,520
We feel we didn't spell a word

460
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,620
At that time, a group of people felt that this was our shame.

461
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,080
So we should look to English grammar

462
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,580
we need grammar

463
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:37,420
But there are no Chinese characters in English grammar

464
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,360
How will it continue to develop in the future

465
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,620
This is the question that people continued to think about at that time

466
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,500
What if there is no English grammar, Chinese characters?

467
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,060
second rhetorical

468
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,340
you might ask

469
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,040
Well, if grammar is so important, with English grammar

470
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,440
why do we need rhetoric

471
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,240
Why were there so many fake grammar names back then

472
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,280
Some Discussions about Rhetorical Words

473
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,100
Well, if you have Wen French

474
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,240
Why do we still have the so-called semantics of rhetoric

475
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
Hope to develop into a discipline

476
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
Why is there still semantics?

477
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,960
because they want to ask how meaning comes about

478
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,920
This is of course related to the most fundamental problem of language

479
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,440
Finally, I will talk about the issues of polygamy and modernity.

480
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,360
Okay, first point about grammar

481
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,040
At that time, of course, the first book about Chinese characters

482
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,280
It is Wentong, it mainly uses classical Chinese

483
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,440
But the first grammar book on the national language was

484
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,640
Li Jingxi's New Mandarin Grammar

485
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,880
published in 1924

486
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,160
After publication, it caused a lot of discussion

487
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
In 1942, Liao Shuqian made a summary

488
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,680
in the process

489
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,360
There are at least two key points in the discussion of Chinese grammar

490
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,360
The first point is

491
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,400
when we talk about Chinese grammar

492
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,840
It is true that it is not necessary and impossible to imitate the West

493
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,360
He didn't say no need

494
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,320
No need to imitate Xifa

495
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,600
we must break

496
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,360
Limitations between polytheory or word theory

497
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
For example, what is word theory

498
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,560
Are you singular or plural

499
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,440
Are you present tense or ongoing tense

500
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,600
Then Jufa is presiding over verbs, numerals, etc.

501
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
it is we going to break this

502
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,760
Pay attention to English grammar

503
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,240
Chinese grammar has such a recognition

504
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
In fact, we only need to talk

505
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,920
think for example

506
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,440
Airframe, Maodian, Moon, Man-Machine, Banqiao, Frost

507
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,440
This is completely inconsistent with the giant law of Western English

508
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,680
Withered vines, mice, faint cliffs

509
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,240
it doesn't fit at all

510
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,320
But in China it is a sentence

511
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,000
Another second point

512
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,280
Lee Kyung Hee expressed it in a convex solution

513
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,960
Jufa should be divided into various parts and functions

514
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,880
what is his mission

515
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
This is a theoretical sequence

516
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,000
However, many discussions at that time put forward this

517
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,720
there is a breach

518
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,960
where is the order of literature

519
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What is a concrete representation of the image

520
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Sentences with thoughts and emotions of things

521
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That is the lively element in the article

522
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
This reminds us of Li Qingzhao's

523
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This search for secrets is in a cold mood

524
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
seven seven miserable seven seven

525
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you will find out

526
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It's totally ungrammatical

527
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But these seven sets of spy characters at the beginning

528
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
the pain of ruining his family

529
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
push to the top

530
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Therefore, traditional calligraphy

531
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Everyone knows Mr. Yang Mude

532
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Mr. Chen Shixiang thinks

533
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is the most winged moment

534
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
When you speak out these seven sets of spy sentences

535
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
so from here

536
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It makes sense to reflect on these two points

537
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
These two reflections are accompanied by

538
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
late nineteenth century to early twentieth century

539
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Some phenomena of rhetoric discussed in the name of grammar

540
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
often someone will say

541
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
i know rhetoric

542
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
it was 1932

543
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,240
Is Mr. Chen Wangdao's rhetoric extraordinary?

544
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,720
But I want to emphasize here

545
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,120
It's not just about the founding of a discipline

546
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,680
In fact, if we compare grammar with rhetoric

547
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,200
You know that rhetoric has a purpose

548
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,840
and most importantly

549
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,920
The first point

550
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,960
When Grammars Don't Talk About Categories of Meaning

551
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,320
When making words and plots related to it

552
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,800
So who is going to talk about the complex relationship between self-containment and meaning?

553
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,320
rhetoric

554
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,120
Second point

555
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,000
When Grammar Becomes a Measure of Parts of Speech

556
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,480
Or when the play structure of the active soldier

557
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,680
Who comes outside the standard form of this expression

558
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,400
Reconsider Chinese or Chinese

559
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,280
The Rhetoric of Diverse Possibilities in Emotional Expression

560
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,120
so i remember we were in college

561
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,800
The Department of National Taiwan University seems to have no rhetoric

562
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,300
But I know there are many teachers

563
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,800
made important contributions to rhetoric

564
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,500
then i felt

565
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
In fact, we need a new view on rhetoric

566
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,500
If from late Qing Dynasty to early Ming Dynasty

567
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,800
Corresponding to Western English Grammar

568
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,300
when it strikes

569
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,000
The rhetoric of how we respond

570
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,300
had its important place in that century electricity

571
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,300
What is the Grammar of Change

572
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Can Grammar Be Changed?

573
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Here we will see a book

574
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Very important is Tang Yue's rhetorical revolution in 1923

575
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Everyone sees that this is 1923

576
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Earlier than Chen Wangdao's rhetoric was published in 1932

577
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Tangyue is not someone else

578
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,300
She is a good friend of Hu Shi at Cornell University

579
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,300
Youth witnesses how she started

580
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Her vernacular or literary revolution

581
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,300
The three words of psychology we are talking about now

582
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Tangyue too

583
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It was his translation that made the final decision

584
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
He later really became a very important psychologist

585
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But he is this Hu family, whether it is the piano-pushing literary revolution

586
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
or sorting out the history of the country

587
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
very important partner

588
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Then he has a book called Xiuci

589
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
grammar of change

590
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
The so-called grammar of change is

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
unusual everyday tone

592
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He said that in rhetoric or composition

593
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Using the original text is not just a matter of conforming to grammatical guidelines

594
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
He says it's just the cognitive function of understanding communication

595
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But there is a more important role

596
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
is to elicit an emotional effect

597
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
In particular, he gives a lot of examples that are all about metaphors

598
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The example of this metaphor is very interesting

599
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
is what we use now

600
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
like one of his hearts

601
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
but why say

602
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
his square heart

603
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Fangfang is the way of dividing squares

604
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,200
Fang is often used to describe a woman's admiration or inner state of mind

605
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Why say a square star

606
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,000
It's better not to say one star

607
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Did you notice an important difference between

608
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,000
He turned the metaphor into a metaphor

609
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
it was just a metaphor

610
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
square star is a metaphor

611
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
But he became a metaphor

612
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
We often say Fang Xing

613
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,200
or be speechless

614
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
tell the truth

615
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,600
The truth is that you have broken your trust

616
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,000
why tell the truth

617
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,200
In fact, it is only a metaphor or a metaphor

618
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
Now it's a metaphor

619
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
not to mention

620
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,800
For example, anthropomorphic

621
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
wind blowing and falling

622
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,200
Blow is our exit

623
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,600
blow the breath out of your mouth

624
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,200
In addition, descending is from a place where the mountain is relatively high.

625
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
to a lower place

626
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,600
This is an anthropomorphic metaphor

627
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,000
But now we also say

628
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
the wind is blowing

629
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,400
In addition, you can also use nature to talk about people

630
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,600
For example we often say

631
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
the person's thoughts or thoughts

632
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,540
very profound

633
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,100
The depth originally refers to the depth of the water

634
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,540
That distance was originally a telescope for talking about the road

635
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,740
But we use natural phenomena to talk about human beings.

636
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,640
so what about these metaphors

637
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,580
It's almost become intentional

638
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,240
let's say you want to think deeply

639
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,780
pondering itself

640
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,180
is a metaphor to become

641
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,780
Situations where everyday spoken English can be used

642
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,420
This is probably what he said

643
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:25,020
inside the grammar of change

644
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,420
There are many examples that we still use today

645
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,320
If we look at the grammar of change

646
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,660
Then the part of speech in the grammar

647
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,460
really only marks a part of things

648
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,000
Let's say we define the word as an adjective

649
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,900
Then he can only express the nature

650
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
This word is the progressive tense

651
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,740
he said action

652
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,140
This is only part of the representation

653
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,180
But we clearly found

654
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,520
so much deep understanding

655
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,680
The situation of multiple variants of one yin or multiple variants of one word

656
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
these kinds of

657
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,560
Between sound and concept, between shape and meaning

658
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,660
You will find that there is not only one correspondence

659
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,160
definitely not just a correspondence

660
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,560
If this is the case

661
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,000
In fact, it has already exceeded the norms of parts of speech.

662
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,660
So the linguist Zhang Shilu at that time

663
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,660
He also translated some of Gao Benhan's Chinese works

664
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,540
he just said pointing

665
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,660
The word finger turned out to be your toe

666
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,160
That is, he turned out to be a hieroglyph, toe

667
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,660
He said what does the word toe conjure up?

668
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:41,160
Toe-up, toe-in, middle toe, toe, etc.

669
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,660
What does this mean about the toes?

670
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,660
There is no way to only see the word toe

671
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,660
It can be judged by determining the role of its part of speech in the play

672
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,660
You have to deliberate and identify from the context

673
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,660
That is to say, in the process of writing Chinese or interpreting Chinese,

674
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,760
Aware of the diversity of Chinese

675
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,560
thus presenting Chinese or Chinese

676
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,240
Maximum possibility in heterogeneous expression

677
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,840
It is why people at that time had to think hard, Jin Si, deep thinking

678
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,560
very important topic

679
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,800
Then we will progress to our heterology

680
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,000
you may find it strange

681
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,600
rhetoric is a science

682
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,240
But why did they promote the so-called heterodoxism at that time?

683
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,160
This was also in 1933

684
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,760
Different and Different Studies is a book written by Li Anzhai

685
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,200
In a moment I'll explain why he wrote the book

686
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,960
he talked about

687
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,480
We must pay at least a few percent attention to the application of language and characters

688
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,960
First, grammar or logic is currently being promoted enthusiastically

689
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,520
But he actually paid little attention to the relationship between language and thought.

690
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,400
At the same time, he pays little attention to the relationship between language and external things.

691
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,600
in graph theory

692
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,940
What's more, he doesn't care

693
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,940
what readers and listeners say about language

694
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,840
what kind of attitude

695
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,840
I think the last point is very important

696
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,700
I think right now we're working on a lot

697
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,500
Whether it is the study of psychology or linguistics

698
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,740
neuroscience research

699
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,640
Or even the AI ​​artificial intelligence we're driving now

700
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,600
this is actually very very important

701
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,640
It is also a very hard part

702
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,480
This last point actually tells us that

703
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,140
our psychology

704
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,940
all the process

705
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,480
Whether it's emotions, thoughts, emotions, etc.

706
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:41,380
will not be all under the control of symbols

707
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,140
we just have to think

708
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,180
Even we often say that the meaning is beyond words

709
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,940
So it's not just the grammar that doesn't regulate our

710
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,280
even many words can not express

711
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,380
So what about meaning generation?

712
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Li Anzhai wrote Semantics

713
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,080
this is very important

714
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,560
Then Li Anzhai was affected by the responsibility

715
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,120
In fact, it was influenced by I.A. Richer

716
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,660
this person is not someone else

717
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,240
He was actually considered to be one of the ten groups of New Criticism

718
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,840
Then he once gave lectures in China from 1929 to 1931

719
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,400
He has a very very famous article

720
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,460
It's called Minnin of meaning

721
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,520
This one looks weird

722
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,800
In fact, he directly

723
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,340
The word Minnin

724
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,680
He analyzed at least 16 meanings

725
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,800
That is to say, the word Minnin is not only available to you by looking it up in the dictionary.

726
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,600
He speaks the word Minnin

727
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,920
For example, his station in the system is the most important

728
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,200
We say he has point

729
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,220
he has meaning

730
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,040
Or it is related to our future expectations

731
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,320
we say he makes sense

732
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,880
or affirmation of my past efforts

733
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,160
we say he makes sense

734
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,720
Or I imagine my acceptance first

735
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,520
my audience

736
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,820
The part he wants to know the most

737
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,100
i think he makes sense

738
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,100
So in this article he is

739
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,200
He actually put forward a very important theory

740
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,600
it's about context

741
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,800
Theory about context

742
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,300
in this article

743
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,100
He talks about grammar

744
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,500
often just sees itself as a normative system

745
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,800
Analyze the so-called correct usage

746
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,000
He said that this is actually a matter of minor details.

747
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,700
he gave an example

748
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,500
He said that a French scholar

749
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,000
Brunaut

750
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,300
Already shouted in 1903

751
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,200
part of speech

752
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,200
That is, the teaching or research method of distinguishing verb names, etc.

753
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,000
There is a very interesting sentence

754
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,700
He said we must make up our minds

755
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,800
thought-based

756
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,700
rather than the study of linguistics based on signs

757
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,000
Then what about I.A. Richards

758
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,700
He actually published a book in the 1930s

759
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,300
Called Science and Poetry

760
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,700
a very important book

761
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,000
He later used this book as a basis

762
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,360
published another

763
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,700
The Definitive Edition is Poetry and Sciences

764
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
in this book

765
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
two languages

766
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He said that there is a scientific language

767
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
is the language of science

768
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
the language of pure science

769
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I hope he is not affected by personal emotions

770
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
There is also no need to consider the subject referred to by the symbol

771
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Can the music listener be restored?

772
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
sensory perception

773
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
he said it doesn't need

774
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But if it's summoning language

775
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
This was in the 1930s

776
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
translate it into emotional language

777
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
For comparison with science

778
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
But I think it might be better to summon

779
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
in the calling language

780
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
but through the rhythm rhyme

781
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and past rhymes experience

782
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
For example, you read a lot of ancient poems

783
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You immediately know where to break the sentence with these seven characters

784
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
etc.

785
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
In the memory of the situation

786
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
emotion born of association

787
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
then calls out on the reader

788
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
emotional longing feeling

789
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
or an attitude

790
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,460
He said we should have two languages

791
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,080
not just one language

792
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,380
He did not deny the language of the preceding science

793
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,680
But he thinks there should be two languages

794
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,120
So if we find that from China

795
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,880
Heard the development of rhetoric from grammar to semantics

796
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,080
Reachers' point of view is actually very important to pay attention to

797
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,800
First, he clearly pointed out the grammar

798
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,560
not the main way to understand semantics

799
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,160
is a way

800
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,440
but not the main way

801
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,560
Instead, close reading of the text

802
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,080
to replace standard grammar teaching

803
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,360
the second

804
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,600
say or write

805
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,200
In fact, their psychological structure is very complex.

806
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,440
In this ambiguous and contextual poetic language

807
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,520
Only then can we be able to distinguish the differences in the expression of poetic and scientific language

808
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,280
he said the poet

809
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,520
Often we have a poem in our hearts

810
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,920
will return to the reciprocating protagonist

811
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,840
several years

812
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,400
The playwright is deeply moved by people's affection

813
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
will have such an important role

814
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,600
because he first used the movement and sound of his own words

815
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,000
to pique our interest

816
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,600
What is the movement and sound of Zici?

817
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,440
We can say that the main thing is actually

818
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,400
structure and rhythm

819
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,800
how did he get together

820
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
Why is this word put in front

821
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,000
Why is that word put at the back?

822
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,800
etc.

823
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
It's what piques our interest

824
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And what about this deep emotion?

825
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,400
It is indeed a science of logic

826
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,200
factors to be ruled out

827
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,600
Ritchard immediately communicated with the alien

828
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Discuss differences in language use in poetic science

829
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Obviously since 1920

830
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,200
What about the trend of discussing Mandarin grammar?

831
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,600
There are some discrepancies

832
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,200
because he turned

833
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Meaningful expression based on meaning or emotion

834
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,800
What is the significance of this in the whole zeitgeist

835
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,400
Grammar

836
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,820
beyond standard discourse

837
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,160
reveals the development of another Chinese language

838
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,720
mind language

839
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,300
Of course, in the end we talked about how to modernize

840
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,120
How to be modern is not the only direction I just talked about

841
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,740
On the Modernization Project of Chinese Characters Since the Literary Revolution

842
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,280
has many angles

843
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,800
For example, we want to pinyinize

844
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,080
Acousticization

845
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,360
we want to simplify

846
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,680
Even if we abolish Chinese characters

847
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,040
Let Chinese characters combine with civilization and science

848
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,620
There are many differences in the location of these calligraphy

849
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,220
Perhaps the most famous example is Lin Yutang's Bright Typewriter

850
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,520
It's very clear and fast

851
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,340
In this Chinese character typewriter

852
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,180
He is a part through romanization and strokes

853
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,000
The part of the stroke is not the hand, the hand is meaningful

854
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,080
The parts of this stroke don't necessarily make sense

855
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,840
he

856
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,860
The method used is the number let's say

857
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Mr. Wang Yunwu's four-corner number

858
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,360
He used this number to further modify the four-corner number

859
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,760
He said that a word only needs four numbers

860
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,880
These four numbers are not in stroke order

861
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,280
is the stroke that starts with the two tallest ones on the upper left

862
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,840
with the two strokes on the lower right

863
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,360
to form four numbers

864
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,760
then on the ice cube typewriter

865
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,640
Lay the parts up

866
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,960
so you type

867
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,480
In fact, it is combined with mechanized stroke configuration

868
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Professor of Golden Animals at Yale University

869
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,320
He once had a book about Lin Yutang's typewriter

870
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,040
He said that this is the meaning system of Chinese characters

871
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,760
system of conversions to letters

872
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,840
is the Western alphabet system

873
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,080
This is a very interesting study

874
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,240
It also tells us that Chinese characters have the possibility of diverse development

875
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,320
But this development is worth thinking about here

876
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,480
If Chinese characters are pinyinized or symbolized

877
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,380
That is to say, Chinese characters are like Western letters.

878
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,580
It can be constructed and spelled out the speaking voice arbitrarily

879
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,840
But there is no way to spell it out

880
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
with font, meaning

881
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,000
so that speaking organisms connect

882
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,160
what's the problem

883
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,700
That is, it ignores the basic nature of Chinese culture

884
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,540
When I construct such a set of Chinese

885
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,380
what is my lust

886
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,760
is a person with complex perception

887
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,720
Instead of the pinyin system for the convenience of quick and simple communication

888
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,260
In fact, through a person with complex perception

889
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,960
to construct a Chinese system

890
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
become the essence of culture

891
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,960
In fact, the question of modernity

892
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,260
We most often think of Fockeau's word thing

893
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,460
He said that since the 17th century

894
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,040
We often record, classify, configure

895
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,400
constructed horizon

896
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,200
Then this field of view

897
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,000
it's called the order of the modern sight

898
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,400
what does this contain

899
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,600
this contains a lot

900
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,200
Museums we frequent

901
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
natural history we see

902
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,200
The financial analysis report we look at

903
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,000
The libraries we looked at Department stores

904
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,100
and what we talked about today

905
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,400
Grammar and Disciplinary Institutions for Knowledge and Language

906
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,000
These establishments are classified into

907
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:29,000
juxtaposed or cut in a field of view

908
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,300
This is the modern line of sight, the underground line of sight

909
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,700
but

910
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,700
did you find out

911
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,300
This is the existence of knowledge prior to man

912
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
The construction of this knowledge system

913
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,800
prehuman existence

914
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,500
it manipulates our look

915
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,600
what we see what we think

916
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
feel

917
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,100
So dominate people

918
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,600
So human knowledge

919
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,000
Hawko even said very pessimistically

920
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,300
This is an inhuman study of the humanities

921
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,600
inhuman is possible

922
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,200
The essence or nature of non-official people

923
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,200
here

924
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,760
The last sentence of the book of words

925
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,720
it is a little mournful in nature to say

926
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,820
people will be erased

927
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,160
like a face in the sand by the sea

928
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,080
He said there is no way

929
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,920
exist in the essence and nature of man

930
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,560
If we have been using the framework of modern vision

931
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,720
Let's see what people and the world say

932
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,400
In fact, the problem of heterosexual Chinese

933
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,080
Putting back the architecture of the modern sight where the grammar resides

934
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,160
You will find that heterosexuality is definitely not just a language problem

935
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,680
It's not just a matter of language

936
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,400
It is more a question of how modern

937
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,000
From the point of view of modernity

938
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,440
We found that there are many

939
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,160
Especially since the so-called scientific enlightenment, rationalism

940
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,960
We will emphasize that we are going to modern

941
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,480
We are going to mechanize

942
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,640
This seems to be a very progressive orientation

943
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,240
But if you look at the original culture

944
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,840
grammatical rhetoric down to these discussions of polysexuality

945
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,900
you will find

946
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,440
It turns out that in the language revolution of Chinese

947
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,500
Has a flipped modern angle

948
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,080
Inside this angle that flips modern events

949
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,540
it provides another mode of feeling

950
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,240
or another affective construct

951
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,020
for example

952
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,080
We're about to talk about Zhu Zhiqing

953
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,220
Zhu Zhiqing says

954
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,380
we really need a new language

955
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,420
So where do we start with this new language?

956
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,300
Zhu Zhiqing is also I.A. Richard

957
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,660
Colleagues who were teaching in China at the time

958
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,500
He is from the Department of Chinese and Richard is from the Department of Foreign Languages.

959
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,100
So Zhu Zhiqing once wrote an article called

960
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,300
Versatile examples

961
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,600
I guess it has something to do with the influence of I.A. Richard

962
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,840
he just said

963
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,600
In one of his articles he talked about

964
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,140
Europeanization of Chinese language and grammar or new ideas

965
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,400
What kind of connection should we have with each other?

966
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,100
Finally, there is a very simple conclusion that

967
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,840
The biggest difference between Chinese and Western poetry

968
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,440
not in grammar at all

969
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,240
Thinking and Feeling Patterns

970
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,580
He said the new sensory style of Chinese poetry

971
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,920
must be fresh

972
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,920
metaphor hint contrast

973
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,080
This is the key to the development of Chinese

974
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,960
He does not deny that grammar is necessary

975
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,320
but he thinks

976
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,000
There must be metaphors, hints, contrasts

977
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,460
this concise

978
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,300
even a bit economical syntax

979
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
to write poetry

980
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,500
Then such a new poem

981
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,600
Only then can it lead to more rich meanings

982
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,640
should we

983
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,980
Everyone knows that Zhu Zhiqing's prose is very famous

984
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,880
Then let's take a look at a poem by Zhu Zhiqing

985
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,580
okay

986
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,420
1922

987
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,920
this very long poem

988
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,320
I only cited one of them

989
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,320
He said like evil beasts

990
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,520
Instinctively feel like some blood and flesh

991
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,960
They also seem to be driven by something

992
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Think of these dull copper plates

993
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,460
Bai Liang's role

994
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,860
In their eyes, the warehouse is crowded and piled up

995
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,340
It's these homologs and toes

996
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,460
It's just a doll

997
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,660
from everything in kokura

998
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,620
I got to know each other quietly like this

999
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,220
That self-authored Xi Si is modern

1000
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,740
this is very clear

1001
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,540
he talks about capitalism

1002
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,700
There are three sources of economic modernity

1003
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,860
The first source is capitalism

1004
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,980
So if a man becomes a beast

1005
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,140
just a decorative figure

1006
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,660
is this the modern we want

1007
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,740
In Zhu Zhiqing's "Modern Times in Xiaocang"

1008
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,100
he shouted like this

1009
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,820
or question like this

1010
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,060
Another poem is also modern

1011
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,940
Chi Zhijun's very famous peach-colored cloud

1012
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,740
He said that in the details of Shenxia

1013
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,460
from chimney spirit

1014
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,500
big peachy cloud

1015
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,940
Made of a beautiful smokeberry

1016
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,260
transparent peachy cloud

1017
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,940
the last paragraph he said

1018
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,140
Girls who really create stressful problems

1019
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,640
The girl from the nose

1020
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,600
when the iron gate poured out

1021
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,440
beautiful peachy clouds

1022
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,640
become in the summer valley

1023
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,360
brewing madness rainstorm

1024
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,880
heavy and terrible dark clouds

1025
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,880
you know the original one

1026
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,480
Peach-colored clouds made of smoke mold

1027
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,080
about industrial development

1028
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,480
But why does industrial development

1029
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,920
Feminines from that

1030
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,480
After coming out of the narrow iron gate

1031
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,080
will become a rainstorm

1032
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,320
What about the heavy, terrible dark clouds?

1033
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,840
you know here is talking

1034
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
possible industrial development

1035
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,040
significant impact on people

1036
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,160
so it's economical

1037
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,840
Now a very important source in my heart

1038
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,080
industrial development

1039
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,360
third Feimin

1040
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,640
That was the famous

1041
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,920
Another Poet Feng Wenbing's Street

1042
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,880
he himself said

1043
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,280
He later wrote this

1044
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,600
flash text said

1045
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,080
I myself walked to Wangfujing Street

1046
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,240
Standing on the street and seeing these scenes

1047
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,960
He said that there is no car pool on the street

1048
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,560
no oil barrel is lonely

1049
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,480
oil drum P.O.

1050
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,120
come to pray

1051
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,760
Throw away the car's code X

1052
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,160
How can Arabic numerals be lonely?

1053
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,720
car lonely

1054
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,120
lonely street

1055
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,520
human loneliness

1056
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,680
this song is very simple

1057
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,160
corpses are called streets

1058
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,160
He said I just stood on the street and saw

1059
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,640
But you will find that he is lonely again and again

1060
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,840
It is no longer in Chinese

1061
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,360
lonely sandbar cold

1062
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,200
Or the loneliness is as deep as the loneliness of autumn

1063
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,800
The loneliness that I understand is not

1064
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,240
On the contrary, there is a distance between things and me

1065
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,880
The more objective I am, the more subjective I am

1066
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,280
The more I get separated from you, the new loneliness

1067
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,960
And what is this loneliness talking about

1068
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,480
is city life

1069
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,440
This is also an important source of economic modernity

1070
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,760
So let's take a simple example with three hands

1071
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,360
Discover how Chinese is modern

1072
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,640
In fact, Chinese poets are pioneers

1073
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:55,960
He does a lot of work that looks like alchemy

1074
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,680
Through these poems we

1075
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,480
Chinese poets can be seen

1076
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,120
how

1077
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,820
Facing the modern times, attempting to enter the modern times

1078
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,420
And how to brew a new modernity while wandering

1079
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,020
Finally I want to ask the question at the beginning

1080
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,060
maybe we don't have the answer

1081
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,860
But through these arguments

1082
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,660
Maybe we can have a preliminary solution

1083
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,720
After the whole discussion, you will find that

1084
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,560
The Pull Moment Between Precision and Multi-Benefit

1085
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,360
Perhaps the first of these we can say

1086
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,160
Language is not just a tool

1087
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,000
It is an organ that shapes the inner mind

1088
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,960
So you see so many commentators

1089
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,660
how they use language to establish themselves

1090
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,320
Understand what others drive their ideas

1091
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,320
Language is definitely not just on the truck

1092
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,580
the second

1093
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,160
We need the language of logical cognition

1094
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,480
It is also necessary to seek a language for cross-domain co-editing

1095
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,100
Cross-domain co-reform We have been talking about cross-domain

1096
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:56,960
cross field

1097
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,960
in the interdisciplinary process

1098
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
how do we express

1099
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,820
How do we properly understand others

1100
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,140
and the ability to incorporate new sympathies

1101
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:09,220
I think language also needs empathy

1102
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,260
not just cognition

1103
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,540
third point

1104
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,840
From this discourse

1105
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,920
We can see that language is constantly in transition

1106
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,980
and different cultures

1107
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,780
From the process of handover and reflection

1108
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:26,620
It is ancient and modern, China and the West borrow from each other

1109
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,960
Mutual construction and handover of cross-border civilizational achievements

1110
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,040
So what we call Chinese now

1111
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,320
not only belong to a certain era

1112
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,760
a political entity

1113
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,420
only a certain generation

1114
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,120
It actually keeps us in the process of transformation

1115
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,000
This is the real development of language

1116
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,640
The development of Chinese language will not only be in China

1117
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,840
If you notice that Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam

1118
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,240
should be an important one

1119
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,440
We can even say that it is another

1120
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,840
The scope of the study of modernity

1121
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,300
part in japanese

1122
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,700
like professor kim munjin

1123
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,400
He put his own Japanese

1124
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,900
translate into chinese

1125
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,900
It is about the relationship between Chinese and the East Asian world

1126
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,300
Speaking of Japan and South Korea

1127
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,800
how to use your own way

1128
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,700
to interpret classical Chinese

1129
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,400
For example, reverse word order

1130
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,500
add some special symbols

1131
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,700
So he doesn't just have one transformation

1132
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,400
There is not only one way to face modern times

1133
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,900
I think what I offer today is

1134
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,000
China

1135
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,300
How to build through the mutual construction of China and the West

1136
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,400
to achieve

1137
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,600
not to say that achieved

1138
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,900
To continue to promote the transformation of Chinese

1139
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,900
report here today

1140
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,600
thank you all
