30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
nutritional epidemiology

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,420
His field of very distinguished research is

32
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,100
Cardiovascular disease and nutrition

33
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,100
I think he will share this topic with us today

34
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,500
has published more than 300 papers

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
He also received many awards

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,300

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,200
One of the highest honors in academia

42
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Alright then we welcome Professor Pan Wan now

43
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,200
good night ladies and gentlemen

44
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
first of all thank you very much

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,600
Thank you, Vice President Liu, for inviting me to the feast of knowledge

46
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Let me share with you today's topic

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
Vice President Liu is actually my old officer.

48
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,000
is the director of our Institute of Biomedical Sciences

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,200
So he recommended me to speak

50
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,000
I also cherish such an opportunity very much.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,700
To be able to work with colleagues in our hospital

52
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,800
Or some friends from the community to talk about

53
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
Citation vitality eats out this topic

54
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,700
This is a very important topic now

55
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,900
because of medical advances

56
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,400
the improvement of economic life

57
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,800
Now everyone pays more and more attention to health

58
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
So the elderly are very, very

59
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
very many

60
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,300
But what about some of the health problems encountered by old age?

61
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,400
actually some

62
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,200
In other words, there is no way to go deep into the research.

63
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,600
there are many things we don't know

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,500
I am very happy to talk about this topic today

65
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,260
So today I mainly tell you about this content

66
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,060
Layer these parts

67
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,760
when i will start

68
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,960
because we speak of vitality

69
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,460
In fact, another aspect of vitality is weakness.

70
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,660
how not to weaken

71
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,560
Maybe it's the other side of vitality

72
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,160
So I'm going to tell you first

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,100
incapacity

74
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,600
and the phenomenon of geriatric syndrome

75
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,360
so you might be clearer

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,260
How can we make the Citing French family

77
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,160
still live with such vitality

78
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,360
That's another

79
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,860
For our comparison there may be some

80
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,600
What about the younger audience?

81
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,860
I can learn about the aging process

82
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,200
Changes in our bodies and our bodies

83
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,160
so maybe even middle age

84
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,260
followed by young

85
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,360
you can think at this time

86
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,960
how do i keep healthy

87
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,260
So when I go to Citing the French

88
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,520
I can be at my best

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
After understanding this

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Maybe we'll be motivated

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
there will be a motive

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So what am I going to do?

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
to avoid such an aging process

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So I will talk about some of the main content of today

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's something related to frailty

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Factors in a Nutritious Diet

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course I don't want to talk like a lecture

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Everyone just listened to the textbook

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
should be like this should be like that

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
so why do i say that

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Some of our empirical research

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I will also introduce to you a little

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that apart from debility

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll talk a little bit about coercion

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because of weakness and restraint

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is in geriatric syndrome

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
most common most important

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So these nutrients

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
After this knowledge is introduced

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll tell you a little bit

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We are currently applying this knowledge to the community

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A few simple photos to tell everyone

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we have some community residents

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
have begun to absorb this knowledge

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
do something like this one

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
a practical operation

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
ok that is

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Today's main content

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Finally, I will tell you

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Our Academia Sinica has an Academia Sinica nutrition information website

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The information in the middle can be used by everyone

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
in myself and in my family

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, what we're talking about today

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I also want to tell you

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
A lot of the knowledge we talked about today

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It is because of a sustainable project of Academia Sinica

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
so some get some new knowledge

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In addition, a lot of information is also from the National Health Service

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Some information from our Taiwan Nutrition and Health Survey

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Allows us to do some data mining

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In the community care base just mentioned

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We are already doing some dietary interventions

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's because the nutritional status and dietary patterns of the elderly from the National Health Service

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Correlation studies with various geriatric syndromes

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then here are some of my partners

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
A lot of what I'm talking about today is them with me

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
made

138
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,600
then first let me talk

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,000
Frailty and disability and geriatric syndrome

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Then let me tell you about us alone

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How do we human beings enter a state of incapacity or weakness

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And what is the relationship between disability and weakness?

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know if you can see this picture clearly

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That is to say, we humans can divide it into

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Use this line to make a distinction

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This place is an old man's function index

147
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So when someone with your better function

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you face a small illness

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
your function may be reduced

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's because he recovered from his illness and returned to health

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But if our body is in a relatively weak state

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I may have a cold, diarrhea or bad teeth

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Possibly the function will drop in a very short time

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
to a state where there may be no way to drop

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
into a state of dependence

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So everyone knows the geriatric syndrome we are talking about today

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In fact, he is not a problem encountered by people in their fifties and sixties.

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
but usually older

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
People in their seventies and eighties

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
that you have been very healthy all your life

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
no cardiovascular disease

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
nothing sick

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
a situation you will also encounter

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So is one such a reference method code by code

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We're talking about something like this

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
so that means

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
One should try to maintain one's own function

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
is in good condition

169
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so you don't run into little ailments

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
When challenged, it falls into a so-called

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
into a state of dependence

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
just dependent

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Then you have to rely on someone else's state

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Or lie in bed and never get up again

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But how do we approach this issue?

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What about the picture I showed you here?

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
is a state that shows the aging of us alone

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We are generally healthier people

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It is a gradual degeneration of function

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,600
Then it must be maintained under a normal life

181
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,860
probably such a very healthy energy

182
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,500
to very old age

183
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,960
it enters into a state of weakness

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
so that aging

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,460
What about the ones who sustain better?

186
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,800
It's the red line that's always been level.

187
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,160
May be there are some very healthy people

188
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
to one hundred years old

189
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,660
When I was over a hundred years old

190
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,160
It is possible that this function line will suddenly drop

191
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,460
and then move on to the next stage of life

192
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,660
But what if a person with a lot of pain

193
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,620
it follows the curve that tends to be

194
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,960
That is to say, its functionality degrades rapidly

195
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,520
when it's not too old

196
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,360
into a state of weakness

197
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,660
So because it's in a weakened state

198
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,220
It is easy to enter into incapacity

199
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,860
It's about reaching this final stage of life.

200
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,620
And so of course we want to say

201
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,920
to keep as much as possible

202
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,920
a state of robustness and vitality

203
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,160
Then maintain the red line to the highest

204
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,720
don't then finally if it's going to fall

205
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,780
also in the shortest possible time

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,560
fall down it's a so-called

207
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,300
Healthy

208
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,900
That is to say, health and longevity

209
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,600
means you can put your

210
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,920
this time of life

211
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
maintain a peak

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
the longer the better

213
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,300
Then if what is going to drop is in a very short time

214
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,720
If such a situation of falling

215
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,960
so aging

216
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,400
aging process

217
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
eventually debilitating

218
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,960
if you are in a debilitated state

219
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,720
if any event occurs

220
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,100
The event can be a fall

221
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,720
Cold or crab belly or bad teeth

222
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,620
What if you're in a debilitated state?

223
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,840
quickly become incapacitated and dependent

224
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,680
What about the topic we're talking about today?

225
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,420
that's how

226
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,720
let at a very old age

227
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,180
To avoid such a situation from happening

228
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,280
So it's called

229
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,020
such a state of vitality

230
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,220
Then I just took this one

231
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,820
Let me show you that there is a line in this picture

232
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,220
That's when you say it's because of various reasons

233
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,020
when young

234
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,020
not taking good care of your body

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
has entered a state of weakness

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
can you still reply

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
actually it is possible

238
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
which means you can still work hard

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
let this one of yours

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
This function curve comes back up

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So it's definitely a possible situation

242
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So we have bodies now

243
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't be discouraged by those who rub a little

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
can be used in some ways

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Lifestyle Ways to Get You Back

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then you walk in a

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Very good for a healthy one on the road

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Well, what I just talked about is

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
because we talk about vitality

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So we're talking about its inverse

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
weak

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Frailty and sarcopenia are two sides of the same coin

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think many of you have heard of sarcopenia

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
basically means

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Sarcopenia is when your body

256
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This muscle mass gradually decreases

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
reduce

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But it may not have reached a critical point

259
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
so you can function normally

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But in one case

261
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
less muscle mass

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Plus the quality of the muscle

263
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
if bad again

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
so-called debility

265
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Frailty is often closely related to chronic disease

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I just talked about frailty and disability

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
may cause disability

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Then if we look at some statistics

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If we look at the weakened group

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Half of him has various so-called chronic diseases

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
As mentioned by our vice president just now, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
various diseases

273
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Then these diseases will indeed cause the debility to occur earlier

274
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
One-fifth of the feeble

275
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
One in five is also paired with disabilities and comorbidities

276
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
About 6% are disabled but have no comorbidities

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Almost one in four people with only frailty alone

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
this is the situation

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So we can see that these conditions exist at the same time

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then I will use the slide below to talk to you

281
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
the health of the elderly

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What kind of problems do the elderly face?

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's not just the old people we often hear

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Have high blood pressure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, stroke

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Uh, these are not just one question.

286
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me explain to you from this diagram

287
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
each of us will age

288
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
even if you don't have any disease

289
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You too are on an aging path

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Possibly due to physical damage from some free machines

291
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
cell aging etc.

292
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Some DNA damage will lead to this aging path

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But this aging process if you have some

294
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the disease i just mentioned

295
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
it's going to be faster

296
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What about the state of aging?

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
uh when it happens

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Our bodies may be in a long-term

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
a low-grade inflammatory state

300
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
With some endocrine wet strips and metabolic changes

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
uh lead to

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But gradually, some phenomena will occur

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I just talked about frailty

304
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But before this debility

305
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Maybe something like these

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
In fact, there are also some mental symptoms

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
easy to say

308
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
melancholy forget

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Some anemia, lack of strength

310
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The problem with swallowing flames

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
wet urine

312
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
or insomnia, malnutrition

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Sarcopenia

314
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
often as i just said

315
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
because of disease

316
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
such a person in such a state

317
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
often used a lot of drugs

318
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
people who take a lot of drugs

319
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What about these risk factors?

320
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Later it will show a

321
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
debilitating condition

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
is that there will be several aspects

323
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
like sudden weight loss

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So we observed an old man

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Suddenly we said that it is not good to be too fat

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But if you are already fat

327
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you observe a fat old man

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
suddenly lost weight

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
that's not a good

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
if he is not there

331
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It seems to be eating healthy

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
or love sports

333
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sudden weight loss is a warning sign

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's a warning sign of weakness

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
sudden weight loss

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Then he often feels exhausted

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
His hand grip is not strong enough

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have no strength to hold things

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,260
It's natural that I don't want to go out.

340
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,320
I used to take a walk, but now I don't take a walk anymore.

341
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,820
I don't do some things normally

342
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,420
Walking, the speed is getting slower and slower

343
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,520
These phenomena are the so-called swerving

344
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,120
when this happens right after

345
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,920
susceptible to injury and infection

346
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,200
easy to fall

347
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,280
that leads to disability and death

348
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,880
So basically it's an old you health issue

349
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,960
so i'm talking about

350
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,320
It's really full of problems behind

351
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,640
But I think people in their fifties and sixties

352
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
should start to understand the problem

353
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,640
Even people in their thirties and forties

354
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
you can also follow

355
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,320
You can also help the elderly in your own home

356
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,960
So the phenomenon just now

357
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,800
In fact, it is what I just called the elderly positive group

358
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,920
Here's what I just said

359
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,600
It broadly refers to health problems that are common among the elderly

360
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,880
The problem with these forces

361
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,920
Weakness Forgetfulness Depression Malnutrition

362
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,040
cognitive function problems

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
urinary incontinence etc incontinence

364
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,400
And even some pain in the window

365
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,300
these are included

366
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
But we just talked about these phenomena

367
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,100
It means that of course there are some

368
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,800
Not necessarily only for the elderly

369
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,700
So do this for the elderly

370
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,400
When discussing geriatric syndrome

371
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,600
We will focus more on frailty

372
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,700
Sarcopenia and falls

373
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,700
This is the three persons who are the three sides of the same one

374
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,900
Dementia is a little different

375
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,000
just a little bit different

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,400
This is a system of muscles and balance

377
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,800
This dementia is a direction of our brain brand

378
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,200
geriatric syndrome

379
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,100
We found a strong correlation with nutritional status privacy patterns

380
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,900
So what I'm going to talk about today is

381
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,600
Some of our international literature

382
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,100
Some information we have seen and our Taiwan

383
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Especially the research done by our sustainable project

384
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
first let me tell you

385
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Papers we have published in 2017

386
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We use Taiwan's Nutritional Health Survey

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Found that we Taiwan's elderly over 65 years old

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The so-called robust in the middle is completely fine

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
40% without any signs of weakness

390
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
7.8% over the age of 65 are already frail

391
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What is weakness?

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The five aspects I just talked about

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If there are three such phenomena in the middle

394
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
so-called weakness

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What is it?

396
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
walking too slowly

397
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
weight loss

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
always feel tired

399
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
reduced physical activity

400
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't have the strength and don't want to go out to do it

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
three is called weakness

402
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
then one or two words

403
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
pre-frailty

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In fact, people over the age of 65

405
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
we look like this

406
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Sixty percent already have

407
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,560
A phenomenon of more than one weakening

408
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Then I will

409
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
OK, what if I get here?

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,640
I'm just telling you

411
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,000
It's one of my main axes today

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
geriatric syndrome

413
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,160
Then I will talk about the following

414
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
as the body ages

415
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,680
What kind of situation is the change with the body

416
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,840
Then this might get some younger people thinking

417
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,400
I will

418
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,800
That is to say, how do we develop as human beings?

419
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,960
It will develop into the weakened state I just mentioned

420
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,920
let's take a look

421
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,920
the body mass index

422
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,480
Both waist circumference and waist circumference are well-known indicators of obesity

423
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
That obesity indicator

424
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,680
On the left is body mass index

425
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,840
We all know the weight

426
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,320
In addition to height

427
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
divide twice

428
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Or divide by the square of the height

429
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
In our impression

430
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,160
That is, whether people have followed from the student days

431
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,120
just getting fatter

432
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,160
Is it in our impression?

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Look at the books in the nutrition and health survey

434
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We see ages from 19 to 44 to middle age 45 to 64

435
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Inside this frame are the elderly

436
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He sure is only going to get better and better

437
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But after entering the age of 65

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
In men, he actually falls down

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
After the age of 65, the weight will come down

440
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Many people may be very happy when this comes down

441
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
but it's not

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
shouldn't be too happy

443
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
you should pay attention

444
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
because it might be a

445
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the mass of your body

446
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
some parts have been reduced

447
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that's what it means

448
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the same waist

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You see the waist was thinner when you were young

450
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
getting thicker

451
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
At the age of 65 to 69

452
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
still in the upper body

453
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But after the age of 70, it will come down

454
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The man saw a phenomenon

455
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Then women are different

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
women age

457
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So the old lady is very obedient when she arrives.

458
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is a phenomenon in Taiwan

459
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But will women go through this process later?

460
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
because we investigate

461
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
when doing this national

462
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
but the very old are less

463
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So there is no way to watch it after this 80

464
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In fact, when women are old

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Maybe after 90s

466
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They are also weight will BMI physical acceleration

467
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
will come down

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So a drop like this is a sign of aging

469
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's a sign of geriatric syndrome

470
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Women are on this picture also see the upper

471
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Because our last grouping is 80 years old

472
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It also showed a rapid loss of body mass in women

473
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is later than men

474
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Men are earlier

475
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There is such a phenomenon

476
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So let's look at body mass index

477
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
with our bones in the middle

478
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
have our muscles

479
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
and our fat all put together

480
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It is not easy to make an understanding

481
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,720
What about our muscles?

482
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,120
That is, the blue above is male

483
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,240
the following is female

484
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,520
If our men are young people from 19 to 44 years old

485
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,400
What about over 80 years old?

486
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Muscle is 6 kg less

487
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,840
The current situation of Taiwanese

488
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,240
Then the female is less than 2.2 kg

489
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,240
that debilitating condition

490
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,720
Appearing here is the weakness I just mentioned.

491
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,320
Early asthenia and no signs of asthenia

492
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,960
you can see weak people

493
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,840
How about compared to people who are not weak?

494
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,840
It's 6kg short

495
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,120
There are old people here

496
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,040
because in young people

497
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,040
We didn't do his debilitating assessment

498
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,440
such a young woman

499
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,200
For older women, the difference is 1.5 kg

500
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
but i want to emphasize

501
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,680
just let everybody see us from this young adult

502
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,600
to old age

503
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,480
You see our muscular men lose 6kg

504
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,040
Women lost 2.2 kg

505
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Of course women and men at the beginning

506
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,440
It's about 20kg short

507
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,000
men and women have big muscles

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So women often have muscle soreness, these things

509
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
because women have less muscle, that's one reason

510
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The other thing is hemoglobin, which is an indicator of normal blood.

511
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
We can see males as young adults versus this middle aged

512
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
His hemoglobin is very high, maintaining around 15

513
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But as soon as he enters old age he declines

514
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Therefore, it is very difficult for men to level blood. Men only have two points to level blood.

515
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
One is around the age of 12 when he grows very fast he will flat blood

516
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Then when they grow into adults, men will no longer have flat blood

517
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It wasn't until he was old that he started to have flat blood.

518
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Well women are not, women are a problem at a young age because of the need to reproduce

519
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Therefore, when women are young, their hemoglobin is only a little over 12

520
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
After menopause, women's hemoglobin will rise

521
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I no longer feel dizzy and lack of energy.

522
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But after the sixties

523
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
will also slowly decline a little bit

524
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This range is very small

525
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But it is a significant drop

526
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So what does this tell us about the problem?

527
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's about energy

528
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
means no strength or anything

529
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
This is related to the aspect of anemia

530
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
also have some relationship

531
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
So there's this one

532
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
A phenomenon we should pay attention to

533
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The other one is lung function

534
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
inhalation of this oxygen

535
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Inhalation is the same as we often use

536
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The so-called maximal forced expiratory volume

537
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
forced expiratory volume in the first second

538
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Then this is related to a

539
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
spirometry problems

540
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
then this is a

541
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This is the so-called trachea

542
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
A question on Tongtong

543
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
you can see that is to say

544
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
in young adults

545
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
He has a lung capacity of four liters

546
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
In the eighties, there are two liters left

547
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
dropped by half

548
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,560
This is also quite influential

549
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,000
Women drop from 3 liters to 1.5 liters

550
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Then this forced expiratory volume in the first second

551
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
also dropped a lot

552
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,300
If some prospective data

553
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,800
you can see that is to say

554
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,700
This waste activity volume and this exhalation volume in the first second

555
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,500
When the degree of a person's weakness

556
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,800
are very relevant

557
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,000
It is also related to the amount of a person's muscles.

558
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,700
Of course, this causal relationship is difficult to say

559
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
Is it because your muscles are lacking

560
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,000
so your breath

561
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,500
You can't have such a large amount of waste

562
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,500
It should be said that it may be the cause of the muscles

563
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
muscular cause

564
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
so this

565
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
one theory is this

566
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
exercise your muscles

567
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,000
Also includes this waste activity

568
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,500
Because the muscles of the whole body and the transverse lattice

569
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
These muscles are all related

570
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
This is also weak

571
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,000
is very closely related

572
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
In addition, it is often used to measure

573
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
It is the five aspects I just mentioned

574
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
It's Linda Freed's five facets

575
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
One is walking speed and the other is lying force

576
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
You can see this green is male

577
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,260
gray is female descended

578
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,860
This is because we only test the elderly

579
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,000
So from the age of 65 to the age of 80, it has dropped by 1.4

580
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,700
down by 1.3

581
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,500
What about this power?

582
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
This place is in kilograms

583
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Lost 8.6kg from 60s to 80s

584
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Female dropped 4.2kg

585
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
So we look at a drop like this

586
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,000
so these are

587
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,500
The parameters I just talked about

588
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Everyone can pay attention

589
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
just like i used to

590
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,000
because I do nutritional surveys

591
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,500
Once I asked someone from my team to help me

592
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
i think i'm in good health

593
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Measured my waste activity

594
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
They said teacher, your amount of wasted work is below average

595
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
i was startled

596
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
I said it turned out that my waste activity

597
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
That part of me might need some work out too

598
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
Then there is also the reclining force that can be measured.

599
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Hemoglobin can also be measured

600
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,500
These are now with some tapering

601
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
start gradually incorporating these items

602
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
so everyone can understand

603
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
A health condition of my own

604
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
The development of this course of fear is generally considered to be

605
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,200
related to genetic and environmental factors

606
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,040
The other common interaction of these factors

607
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,520
damage some cells in our body

608
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,440
or a lesion at some molecular level

609
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,480
This damage will affect some functional decline of multiple system organs

610
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,680
Including brain, endocrine, immune, muscle, heart, blood vessel, breathing, kidney, etc.

611
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,160
I just mentioned things like breathing, muscles

612
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,120
after this drop

613
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,400
Without proper nutrition such a lifestyle

614
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,120
and use proper physical activity to maintain your body's muscles

615
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,040
and cell function

616
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,240
It is easy to develop symptoms of dread

617
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,000
This is what I just mentioned when something unexpected happens

618
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
metabolic syndrome

619
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,200
Next, I will use this picture again.

620
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
let me tell you about this

621
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,400
The vicious cycle of aging and disease

622
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,800
a state

623
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
so everyone can understand

624
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,600
Sometimes we also observe

625
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,000
some changes in your body

626
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,800
you may know

627
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,200
We are all aging

628
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,000
and there may be some diseases

629
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,600
sorry this is in english

630
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,600
This is really hard to change to Chinese

631
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,000
So I will speak clearly when I speak

632
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,400
So in the process

633
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,400
Did we just talk about it

634
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
our muscles will decrease

635
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
What about when we lose muscle?

636
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
It will happen that a phenomenon is

637
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,200
My so-called basal metabolic rate drops

638
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Because muscles are very energy-consuming

639
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,400
when you lose muscle now

640
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,200
you don't need so much energy

641
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,800
your metabolic rate drops

642
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,800
What about after a drop?

643
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
your need your this

644
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
You need to burn fewer calories

645
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
It means you are a person with less muscle

646
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,200
You just sleep over there and you drain energy

647
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So in this case the words

648
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
your appetite may be affected

649
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You don't need so many calories

650
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
your appetite is affected

651
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you start not wanting to eat?

652
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
you don't want to eat after

653
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Just slowly this nutrient

654
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
less will come in

655
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The cycle will continue after less

656
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
the so-called negative calorie balance

657
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
After negative caloric balance

658
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
after your calorie loss

659
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
do you have less muscle

660
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
you enter a vicious cycle

661
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The part that can't move

662
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
is to say

663
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
when you have less muscle

664
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
you have no strength

665
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Then your VO2

666
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
is your oxygen

667
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
VO2 will drop

668
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The amount of oxygen you can breathe in drops

669
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
like this case

670
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
you walk slower

671
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
when you walk slowly

672
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
your activity

673
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
you don't want to go out

674
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So you're less active again

675
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Then further reduce

676
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
caloric needs

677
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
eat less calories

678
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,820
what about less

679
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,520
Nutrients come in less

680
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,560
After that, you will have less energy

681
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,920
so it's a vicious cycle

682
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,800
So when we understand such a situation

683
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,520
If you find out that it is the old man in the family

684
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,800
when there is such a situation

685
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,120
you have to break it

686
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,480
Your cycle can be interrupted

687
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,160
you just have to give it some broken links

688
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,960
Start with the simpler of course

689
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,640
So exercise and diet are closely related

690
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,600
Although I am talking about diet today

691
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,000
But exercise is essential

692
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But because there are more sports information

693
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,520
Everyone knows how to exercise

694
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,560
So today I just focus on

695
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,440
I am more professional this is

696
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,560
part of nutrition

697
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,360
So what I'm going to say is

698
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,960
This vicious cycle can be broken

699
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,760
that may have to wait until the end to ask the question

700
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,080
we will continue

701
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,440
So when I talk about this side now

702
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,880
I'll start talking to you

703
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,000
besides sports

704
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,400
This exercise is definitely to do

705
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
and in motion

706
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,740
There are many tricks, there are many faces

707
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,440
All kinds of different sports we don't mention today

708
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,400
Let's talk about it later

709
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,440
Then I will start talking about it today. Good with exercise.

710
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,160
then how do we eat

711
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,640
Only then can this phenomenon

712
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,400
able to make a reply

713
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,640
then let me tell you first

714
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,240
is of course we have to take a look

715
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,240
current scientific literature

716
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,200
The current scientific literature is debilitated in this

717
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,700
What about the little part?

718
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,400
Basically most of them are talking

719
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,700
protein

720
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,700
that's ok i can say that

721
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,640
Whether transverse or forward

722
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,540
That is, you may not know the term

723
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,040
but it doesn't matter

724
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,700
or some interventional experimental research

725
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,500
Both have supported protein and frailty

726
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
is negatively correlated

727
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,640
mean to say

728
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,000
you eat more protein

729
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,540
you won't be weak easily

730
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,000
you eat less protein

731
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,700
you are more likely to weaken

732
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,300
This is especially about the elderly

733
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,200
so older people

734
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,240
That is to say, this protein cannot be ignored

735
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,520
I remember two days ago I was with a colleague

736
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,200
so-called advanced intellectuals

737
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,880
We all happened to be vegetarians.

738
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,800
Be vegetarian because when we eat out

739
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,160
I think vegetarian bento is safer

740
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,400
Because its oil will not be a bad oil

741
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,400
But this vegetarian bento happens to be inside

742
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,960
It's all vegetables without any protein

743
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,600
so i told the restaurant

744
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,480
can we have some protein

745
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,400
Then my colleague said

746
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,960
no no no no protein

747
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,520
I said why

748
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,720
He said the burden of winning is too heavy

749
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,200
Then I tell him it's important

750
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,480
He said it was especially important for the elderly

751
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,200
Then my colleague immediately told me that

752
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,840
I think old people just shouldn't eat too much protein

753
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,680
The burden of victory is too heavy

754
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,800
Then of course I'm not good

755
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,760
but i know

756
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,520
This means that many people have such a concept

757
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,160
That is to say, the elderly should not eat too much protein

758
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,800
May be physically taxing

759
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,960
Then I want to tell you that

760
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,080
The current scientific literature is

761
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,200
Supports the release of protein and herbal medicines Interrelated

762
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,500
Then these studies

763
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,400
I have no way to talk to you today

764
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,800
It's probably an egg balancing study

765
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
that is, discussing a person

766
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
how much protein do i give it

767
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
and see how much it excretes

768
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Which point will reach the balance

769
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,300
Most of these studies

770
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,200
Of course there are new ways

771
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,800
use this stable

772
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,400
Isotopes of ISO TOG

773
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,600
Add a label to that amino acid and eat it

774
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,900
Then look in the middle of the exhaled air

775
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,400
how much of this

776
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,900
These isotopes use this method

777
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
many ways to make

778
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,000
Well, we don't have such research in Taiwan at all.

779
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So in order to understand Taiwanese

780
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,400
How much protein should I eat?

781
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,300
We used another method

782
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,100
This method is to say

783
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,800
AI for Nutrients

784
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,000
AI is the so-called appropriate intake

785
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,900
this is a method

786
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,300
This method is acceptable in nutrition

787
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,600
it means

788
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,000
If you do not have the appropriate data

789
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,400
you just evaluate that

790
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,360
How much do those people who have no problem at all eat?

791
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,460
Because we do not have such research in Taiwan

792
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,780
Then these researches are being done by several groups around the world

793
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,380
The egg balance study I just talked about

794
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:18,720
So we use Taiwan from 2014 to 2017

795
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,000
This nutritional data in 2017

796
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,460
let's do the math

797
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,640
We just divide the elderly into

798
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,860
Frailty Non-frailty Early stage of frailty and frailty

799
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,820
Let's see, everyone just look at the data on the right.

800
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
Here is the number of people doing statistics

801
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,240
Then the most important thing for us to see is that there is no problem.

802
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,060
These elderly people without debilitating diseases

803
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,940
what is his protein intake

804
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,300
We see that it is 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight

805
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,860
1.21 male female is 1.22

806
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,100
this is a median

807
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,560
Of course, this is a concept of our statistics

808
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,780
That means I don't use averages

809
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,700
instead of the median

810
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,100
what does the median mean

811
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,220
is the most people

812
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,340
The most lack of people here

813
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
These people in the middle are all ingesting this amount

814
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,680
Then we dare not use the average

815
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,600
Why? Because people eat protein and some people eat a lot

816
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Incredibly many

817
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,720
So once you average down, the average value will be skewed.

818
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,120
So we use the median

819
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,000
We can see debilitated people who weigh a kilogram a day

820
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,200
eat less than a gram

821
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,480
Pre-failure is centered

822
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,280
Then this number may not mean anything to you

823
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
Maybe you see this number and think it’s nothing

824
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,360
but i want to tell you

825
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,320
Globally International Recommendations for Protein

826
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,400
almost all have a number

827
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,760
That number is 1.2

828
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,840
Doesn't matter if it's Canadian or EU people

829
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,360
he basically said

830
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,080
An old man needs to eat 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight a day

831
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,920
Then this 1.2 grams is meaningless to everyone

832
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
I don't know how much 1.2 grams is

833
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,480
I'll talk to you later

834
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,120
you can eat like this

835
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,000
So this 1.2 grams is a magic trick

836
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,400
Same as Magic Number

837
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,920
But now there are actually some other children

838
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,120
yes

839
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,820
Most people are like this, but if you are in a

840
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,660
For example, the state of illness, the state of lying down for a long time

841
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,480
In fact, your body's response to protein

842
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,300
Utilization is poor and you have to add more

843
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,820
Can be increased to 1.4

844
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,160
Even some people 1.6 can have such a guide

845
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,460
But one thing I'm happy to say is that

846
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,020
We use this AI's orphan algorithm

847
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,880
The figures obtained in Taiwan are similar to those obtained internationally.

848
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,920
Then this data we also

849
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,760
It is recommended to go to the National Health Service of our country

850
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,060
what does that mean

851
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,400
Then I will now test because of such a data

852
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,160
Taiwan

853
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,720
We all know the advice to the people

854
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,800
Our government promulgated a policy called the American-Japanese Dietary Guidelines

855
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,860
This American-Japanese Dietary Guide is precisely calculated

856
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,160
That is, if you keep eating

857
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,480
All your nutrients will be up to standard

858
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,260
But back then

859
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,320
when doing this

860
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,860
No one knows that the body weight of the old man's body is 1.2 grams

861
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,840
At that time, we used the target of 1.0 instead of 1.2

862
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,200
So now I want to say okay let's check it out

863
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,080
Will everyone be getting enough of what the country recommends?

864
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,840
So in fact, there are some recommended calories for each age group

865
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Make some suggestions according to the weight and height of our Taiwanese, you see

866
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,560
So in fact, the recommendations are very detailed for people aged 19 to 34

867
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,080
If he eats such 1850 calories

868
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,880
Or he eats 2150 to above

869
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,440
Is his protein enough enough to reach 1 kg 1.2 grams

870
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,040
Really boys are enough, 31 to 50 years old

871
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,640
It's all OK because even a 71-year-old

872
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,600
If he eats 1650 calories he will be enough

873
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,440
But we found that if it is on the female side

874
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,560
From young women he has some people who eat very little

875
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,760
1450 calories only

876
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,960
In old age, some women in their 70s only eat 1300 calories

877
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Everyone knows that many weight loss diets are 1200 calories

878
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,500
So Yiqiansan’s understanding of non-film and television is not far behind

879
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,700
So for those who are older and eat less

880
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,300
His protein is not enough

881
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,000
So here's a thing

882
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,900
In fact, there is usually a general rule

883
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,500
That is if you eat very little people

884
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,500
you are prone to malnutrition

885
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,100
So because in the past everyone was

886
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Have you ever thought about being fat?

887
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,500
I think it's better to eat less

888
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,100
But the fact here is that if you eat very little

889
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,800
In old age you are very prone to malnutrition

890
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,600
If there is not enough protein, it will enter the stage of weakness

891
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,300
So let me mention this to you first.

892
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,300
So now we are talking to the government

893
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:43,600
Your dietary advice for people who eat less

894
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,500
to modify

895
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,200
Otherwise these people may fall into protein deficiency

896
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,100
Especially the camp French

897
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,500
Then I will tell you more clearly later.

898
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,100
Because of this throughout my speech today

899
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,000
I just want to say that you don't just listen to some principles

900
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,400
You really can make a diagnosis of your own diet

901
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,840
so i'll make it clearer later

902
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,640
OK so now I'm done with protein

903
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,140
That is to say, protein is the most concerned in the world

904
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,640
to address the weakness

905
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,200
Then our Taiwan data

906
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,840
It seems to be consistent with the international data

907
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,600
Then in addition

908
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,000
Frailty is not only related to protein

909
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,940
Is it not related to other nutrients?

910
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:29,100
We found in the literature

911
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,900
I saw that it is related to many trace elements

912
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,540
And it seems that there is a phenomenon that

913
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
Nutrient deficient items

914
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,100
more words

915
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:43,140
the greater the chance that the person is debilitated

916
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,180
that phenomenon

917
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,700
Actually it's a bit paradoxical

918
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,200
That is, I see that in the literature, apart from protein

919
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,340
The lack of number one

920
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,700
Lack of document number B12 Lack of C

921
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,140
new lack

922
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,500
have some correlation

923
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,400
But this correlation

924
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
what does he mean

925
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,000
that's hard

926
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
We found information in our Taiwan Nutrition and Health Survey

927
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We use something called the 24-hour recall method

928
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
means meeting someone

929
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I clearly asked him what he ate 24 hours yesterday

930
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Made after accurate quantification by various methods of food model

931
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I just found out that people with sarcopenia in Taiwan

932
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Low protein number B2B12C

933
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Calcium manicure

934
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
30,000 tails of polyvinyl alcohol are low in fatty acids

935
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
When we see such a phenomenon

936
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Think from the standpoint of a nutritionist

937
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'd think maybe that's not the case

938
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It must be that he ate less.

939
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
so you can see everything

940
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Because it is impossible to say that all of the

941
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
it's hard to say

942
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
So one conjecture might be that

943
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Is it just eating too little?

944
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
will be such a phenomenon

945
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And if we know that these many nutrients

946
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
If I supplement all these nutrients with vitamins

947
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,500
can it be

948
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,160
So we have to clarify

949
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,960
what kind of reason

950
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
So we go one step further

951
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,300
let's discuss

952
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,500
It's the old man in Taiwan

953
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,000
If he is debilitated

954
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,700
his six categories of food

955
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,000
his overall diet

956
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
what is it like

957
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,460
then let me tell you

958
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,700
This is male data

959
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,000
I don't know if this will be a little difficult

960
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,460
but i said slowly

961
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,560
means you see this

962
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,460
Men without debilitating disorders

963
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,420
His average calorie intake is 2170 calories a day

964
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,720
But when it comes to debility

965
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,920
He is 1898 kcal

966
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,920
So about a 200 calorie difference

967
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,760
He used to eat less overall

968
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
In the early stage of frailty, I borrowed from the central

969
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,260
that you different heat people

970
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,120
he is different

971
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,460
In fact, the six categories of this proposal

972
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,720
What are the six categories of recommendations?

973
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,960
in fact

974
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,220
When we generally make dietary advice

975
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Divide food into six categories

976
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,480
It means that you have to eat these six categories

977
00:42:59,480 --> 00:42:59,980
these foods

978
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And if you eat all of these six categories of food in the amount I suggest you

979
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
You don't have to worry, you have enough nutrients

980
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
The teacher usually recommends that

981
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
What about when your calories are low?

982
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Your six categories of advice are less

983
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
For example, in this place, what I express with a forest-colored frame is its suggestion

984
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
In fact, all stocks here are our staple food.

985
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
That is to say, it is suggested that three bowls of rice may be enough

986
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But we noticed that these debilitated people eat a lot

987
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
He only needs three bowls

988
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But he ate three and a half bowls a day

989
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
He ate more than

990
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Then look at this, on the other hand, this normal person eats slightly less than what he should eat

991
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
his less

992
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But as you can see, this bean fish meat egg is the so-called protein

993
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
All kinds of meat, eggs, seafood

994
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
The weak man also eats less

995
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
he also eats less

996
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Normally, with this early stage of weakness, he simply exceeds the amount

997
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But are they too much protein?

998
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Actually they don't have much protein

999
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Another important source is milk

1000
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Then our people don't drink milk

1001
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So there's a lot of protein missing here.

1002
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and calcium

1003
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
so we can see

1004
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
if you're the one who didn't fall

1005
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Actually your protein is just right

1006
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
The amount you eat is to mix milk and this

1007
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Salmon are just right together

1008
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Of course because its protein comes from non-dairy products

1009
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Of course these people are

1010
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Almost all Taiwanese are calcium deficient

1011
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So our bones are a big problem

1012
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
For this male of these people

1013
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Then the fruit didn't meet the standard

1014
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And there is not enough fat

1015
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
because we young people

1016
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It's all too much oil

1017
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But these old people have not reached the level of fat

1018
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
This grease Taiwan's grease

1019
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The recommended amount is the so-called five servings

1020
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
This is six servings

1021
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
is very little is six teaspoons

1022
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
very little

1023
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
But the reason none of them reach is because

1024
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Old people dare not eat too much oil

1025
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So it doesn't have enough calories

1026
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
so you can see

1027
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
a diet is

1028
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
slightly too much rice

1029
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Not enough protein, not enough milk

1030
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
For men, it seems that vegetables and fruits are not enough

1031
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
low fat

1032
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So it's a situation where all kinds of things are not enough

1033
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Well, women have a similar trend

1034
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The female we see is that her heat is not that big of a difference

1035
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's weak, and it didn't say anything special

1036
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
She basically eats much less than men

1037
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But no, there's not much difference between the three

1038
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But this frail female is also what she almost should be.

1039
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Eat an 80% full meal, three bowls, that is, almost 2:4 bowls are enough

1040
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But she ate nearly three bowls of rice

1041
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
She also has less protein

1042
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I don't drink this milk

1043
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Very little fruit and very little fat

1044
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But we can see that women eat more vegetables

1045
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
So it feels like protein is really a key

1046
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So we see such a diet pattern

1047
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
there is an understanding

1048
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So one of the properties just mentioned

1049
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That is to say, it seems that it is the time when the French people start to grow old

1050
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Don’t still use the concept of serving food with vegetables

1051
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Because especially Taiwanese food

1052
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's still rice

1053
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Nutrients in it

1054
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
are not so rich

1055
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
protein doesn't seem to be enough

1056
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
There is also too little fat

1057
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
too few calories

1058
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
We know these characteristics

1059
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Then we use another angle

1060
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
to explore the so-called dietary pattern

1061
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Just to see how rough these six categories are.

1062
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
What kind of food is that person choosing?

1063
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He's not weak

1064
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So we're going to look at this issue

1065
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Of course, first of all, look at the international

1066
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
what kind of information

1067
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Everyone knows the famous Mediterranean diet, right?

1068
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
because he is so famous

1069
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
so almost what disease

1070
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Everyone take this Mediterranean diet

1071
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
let's discuss

1072
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
So even debility

1073
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
These ten are now internationally

1074
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
The most important thing to discuss about dietary patterns is

1075
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Mediterranean Diet Discoveries

1076
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
You eat more when you are middle-aged or when you are old

1077
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Long-term intake if it is in the form of Mediterranean diet

1078
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Less prone to frailty

1079
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And vice versa, if it's a Western diet

1080
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Just a lot of red meat burgers vegetarian

1081
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It is easier to suffer from debilitation

1082
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
This is a study of Westerners

1083
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But after all, there is no way we can combine the Mediterranean diet

1084
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Just apply it to Taiwan

1085
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I can learn a little

1086
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
But there is no way to be completely like this

1087
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
There is very little research on that Chinese in frailty

1088
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
In the past there was only one Hong Kong study

1089
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
When we published the 207 paper

1090
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Only Hong Kong has one

1091
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
But his entire study failed to find a relevant dietary pattern

1092
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
That also has something to do with his analysis method.

1093
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So we use what we just said

1094
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
The data of Taiwan's nutrition and health survey

1095
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
explore this our this

1096
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
this debilitating diet

1097
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
We publish in American Geriatrics Society

1098
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,640
Magazine, take a look

1099
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,120
Then what method do we use?

1100
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,400
We use a simple dimensional analysis called data mining

1101
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,040
The so-called simple-dimensional analysis method is

1102
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,200
Think about it, don't we eat a lot of food?

1103
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,120
you have dozens of kinds you have vegetables

1104
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,360
Various fruits and vegetables with drinks

1105
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,280
With milk, with beans, with seafood

1106
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,200
After lots and lots of food we all went to ask

1107
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,880
this dimension is too big

1108
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,480
And people don't say how to eat

1109
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,280
It doesn't mean how long you eat this thing

1110
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,680
Rather it is the emergence of a form

1111
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,160
For example, if I assume I eat a lot of red meat

1112
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,000
I don't have room in my stomach for that

1113
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,720
For example, tofu or fish and shrimp

1114
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,880
Then I may be a person who likes meat very much

1115
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,000
I'm sure I can't eat too many vegetables

1116
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Because there's no more space in my stomach

1117
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,680
So food is a way of appearance

1118
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,160
We made such an induction

1119
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,360
Then found a diet pattern

1120
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,160
What about this diet?

1121
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,960
wait a minute it's in english

1122
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,000
I'll use the next one to put it together

1123
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
This diet pattern shows that

1124
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
if you have a form

1125
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
that form is

1126
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Why can't you take them apart and put them together?

1127
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
is what you eat

1128
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
a lot of fruit

1129
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Eat more lotus seeds

1130
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I also like to drink more tea

1131
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
eat more vegetables

1132
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
The rice you eat is also whole grains

1133
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Then you have more protein

1134
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Excuses

1135
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
you drink more milk

1136
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
You also eat more fish

1137
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
of course

1138
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
we may have a hard time saying

1139
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
which one is it

1140
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But it could also mean

1141
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Each of these has half an eye and a little character

1142
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So in summary

1143
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
The green part means

1144
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
if you can

1145
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
eat more than enough

1146
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
plant food

1147
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
You see this food contains vegetables

1148
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
What about fruits and plants?

1149
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
staple food is plant-based

1150
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
yes

1151
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Nutmeg Seed Oil

1152
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The lotus seed is that it is oily

1153
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
A sort of

1154
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,120
We divide the oil into cooking oil

1155
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,480
and lotus seeds that you can eat as a snack

1156
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,640
it's all oil

1157
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,040
But it must be the lotus seed in the oil

1158
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,720
such food and drink

1159
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,160
So tea is a drink

1160
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,320
That will provide phytochemicals

1161
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,400
so apart from what we know

1162
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,320
fiber nutrients minerals

1163
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,320
There is also a so-called phytochemical

1164
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,800
it will be provided

1165
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,560
So what kind of protein is it with?

1166
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,600
You can see these proteins

1167
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,400
is less saturated fat

1168
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,080
We all know that saturated fat causes inflammation

1169
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,640
when the body is aging

1170
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,480
I just talked about the body having a low-grade inflammation

1171
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,200
then this will affect

1172
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,960
Your body's protein synthesis

1173
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,680
this low

1174
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,720
So it is a less protective fat

1175
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,800
And it seems that the cover is quite rich

1176
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,920
Cover quality of excuse class

1177
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,240
cap quality of milk

1178
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,440
these of fish

1179
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,360
The cap quality is relatively rich

1180
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,240
some proteins

1181
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,960
Everyone knows about the fish

1182
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,920
middle of fish especially raw sea fish

1183
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,960
its omega

1184
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
3 omega 3 fish oil is also anti-inflammatory

1185
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,400
So this combination is actually very, very reasonable.

1186
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,200
a combination of

1187
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,100
OK, so according to the information just now

1188
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,400
Let's sort it out and look at it like this

1189
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,800
It is for the prevention and treatment of senile Mohr disease

1190
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,000
Tips for this diet

1191
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,800
The first we found was

1192
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,000
Moech disease is a variety of nutrients

1193
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The condition of low intake

1194
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,400
but other than protein

1195
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,800
These other ones we don't really know who is a key factor

1196
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
Why do proteins know

1197
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,200
Because of years of research and interventions

1198
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,900
It means you are weak and I will give you protein

1199
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,400
You see if there is such a study

1200
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,900
There is a lot of research on the headlines of this course protein

1201
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,500
not so sure

1202
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,900
not so sure

1203
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,900
But this direction is relatively certain

1204
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,100
So the only way is to do an intervention study

1205
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,300
That is to say, what you observe is sexual

1206
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,100
you put this

1207
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,760
Such a thing is given to the feeble

1208
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,200
Let's see if he eats well

1209
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,960
that's the only thing that can be proven

1210
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,840
So, from the information on the diet form just now,

1211
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,400
We're just thinking if

1212
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,340
We follow this in the daily dietary guidelines

1213
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,480
This way of taking a balanced diet is recommended for the elderly

1214
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,080
What if he does this?

1215
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,300
he just made sure

1216
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,880
Nutrients up to standard

1217
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,200
Contains protein will hit the mark

1218
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,840
Of course the low calorie one

1219
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,400
We're going to tweak the protein

1220
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,520
Then his overall nutritional status improved

1221
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,520
that might be beneficial

1222
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,420
whole body system

1223
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,880
Maintenance of function and muscle mass

1224
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,040
That's a hypothesis we made

1225
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,640
Of course it means just this

1226
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,280
The premise of our hypothesis is that

1227
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,600
there is an important

1228
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,160
Requirements are more than 1500 calories

1229
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,480
Protein is really okay

1230
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,480
But what if it's under 1500 calories?

1231
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,040
still need to make some adjustments

1232
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,120
I'm going to make some adjustments

1233
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,120
so we are

1234
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,960
Published in 2018

1235
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,700
Proof-of-principle interventional studies

1236
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,560
Just put the principle

1237
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,200
put it in for a discussion

1238
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,200
designed an experiment

1239
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,800
I will first talk about the results of this experiment

1240
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
Then I will say that this experiment is

1241
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,900
tell the old man how to eat

1242
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,700
So you can refer to

1243
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,000
talk about it first

1244
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,200
It is at the Miaoli Hospital of the Ministry of Health and Welfare

1245
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,800
we ask them to refer some

1246
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,400
After a little certification, the old man gave us an interventional study

1247
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,600
Then this study is a small study

1248
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,900
Later we expanded it

1249
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,400
that in this study

1250
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,600
Then we divided the elderly into the control group

1251
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,800
do nothing

1252
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,000
give him some vitamin mineral powder

1253
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,300
And give him vitamin mineral powder

1254
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,600
and protein powder

1255
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,300
There is dietary intervention

1256
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,300
It was found that other

1257
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,800
like protein powder

1258
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,900
He's also helpful.

1259
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,700
a little help

1260
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,900
But the real best is the food

1261
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,200
an intervention

1262
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,600
I dropped his score from 1.4 to

1263
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,200
0.77 means that

1264
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,000
Almost down 0.50 0.6

1265
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,400
he means to say

1266
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,200
In fact, these old people are not too serious.

1267
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,900
he just has 1 or 2

1268
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,640
Such an old man with thick asthenia

1269
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,240
We can say that 50% of them are elderly

1270
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,880
He lost one symptom

1271
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,080
Because his score dropped around 0.6

1272
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:11,880
probably so

1273
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,880
He is remarkable for having such an effect

1274
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,320
In addition, we also measured the depression of old age.

1275
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,720
This is also found

1276
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,640
He will have a better mood

1277
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,760
see this phenomenon

1278
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,520
This is what we used in a small study

1279
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,920
publish it first

1280
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,520
Then we did it again

1281
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,360
This is also the sustainable plan of Academia Sinica

1282
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,800
We conduct a large study

1283
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,200
just a little more crowded

1284
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,600
There are about 300 people

1285
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,080
4% main

1286
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,960
At this time, it is also paired with exercise

1287
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,120
It is the master of contrast and the master of movement

1288
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,040
Nutrition master and nutritionist exercise master

1289
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,400
Our intervention is

1290
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,880
Take a Nutritional Counseling

1291
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,640
Coordination and physical fitness consultation

1292
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,240
Then let the old man go home and do it himself

1293
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,640
how to make him like this

1294
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,800
as far as we found

1295
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,840
That's the control group is blue

1296
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,640
Then sports nutrition in different colors

1297
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,360
Can see the drop in this sour score

1298
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,520
There is a downward trend

1299
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,840
And the nutrition group is slightly better than the exercise group

1300
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,840
Nutrition plus exercise group is best

1301
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,040
such a phenomenon

1302
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,840
The article here is currently being revised

1303
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,000
Submitted papers should be accepted

1304
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,160
that's a very cheap step in

1305
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,640
That is to say, it will not cost the country too much money to intervene

1306
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,920
I have seen such an effect

1307
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,760
What about this?

1308
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,880
I'm coming to tell you

1309
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,720
But how much did we change

1310
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,480
In fact, very small changes are not very big

1311
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,040
So maybe I'll stop here a little bit now

1312
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,040
Most people might think that

1313
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,760
I have vegetables and I have fruits

1314
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,000
You asked me to eat the whole stock, and I also ate it.

1315
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,840
You said I would eat with wheat

1316
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,600
Then why is my health not as good as yours

1317
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,160
for example

1318
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,600
like my words me personally

1319
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,900
should be inside our lock

1320
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,600
I'm pretty healthy

1321
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,600
But the bento I make with everyone every day

1322
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,000
that difference

1323
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
That small difference means

1324
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,200
Now this bento

1325
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,900
I looked over and said

1326
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,200
too few vegetables

1327
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,500
There is enough protein, why is the rice white rice?

1328
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,200
That's what I've got in mind

1329
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,500
So I'm going to correct it

1330
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,800
i go home at night

1331
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,000
I just eat back the vegetables I don't have enough

1332
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,900
The fruit I didn't have enough also came back

1333
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,200
Then he gave me rice

1334
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,400
I might just take a little of that for myself

1335
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,000
Sprinkle that wheat germ tooth powder on it

1336
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,700
I'll just make a small change

1337
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,000
Your body is different from others

1338
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,500
so look over here

1339
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,500
Control group Exercise group Nutrition group

1340
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,500
These four groups look at the first point

1341
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,000
Whole stock and shoulder amine is rice

1342
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,900
Everyone still has three months of hard work

1343
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,700
Nothing has changed, everyone eats the same

1344
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,200
but the previous one

1345
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,500
This is the control group and the exercise group

1346
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,000
Its protein hasn't changed either.

1347
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,900
but look

1348
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,600
It's the nutrition group, it's called the nutrition exercise group.

1349
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,200
its increased protein

1350
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
increased by half

1351
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,740
Half portion seems to be rare, right?

1352
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,680
But it adds half after all

1353
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,840
Then its milk increased by 60cc

1354
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,040
So these two things

1355
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,480
Turns out you know we test these guys

1356
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,880
the egg in it

1357
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,040
Because there is nitrogen in the protein

1358
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,840
The urine egg in it is a significant increase

1359
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,040
For acid shock

1360
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,100
Urinary egg means more protein is more important

1361
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,300
just add a little bit

1362
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,300
it's ok

1363
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,200
Everyone eats fruits and vegetables

1364
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,600
also slightly increased

1365
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,600
Nutrients

1366
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,000
Probably added 0.3 servings of fruit

1367
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,800
But there is another interesting thing

1368
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,300
because we gave them lotus

1369
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,900
so they added a portion and a half a day

1370
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,500
That is, the fruit of the hour and a half

1371
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:51,300
These are the old people who eat an extra tablespoon a year

1372
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,100
all kinds of lotus

1373
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:58,100
like some almonds and so on mixed together

1374
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,100
Also because of their increased protein

1375
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,200
It will also increase the oil of the half food

1376
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,400
It may be necessary for spray toughness

1377
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,540
So you think about this for a while

1378
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,480
Calories in wagashi

1379
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,540
Just push it up a little bit

1380
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:10,780
protein also pushed up

1381
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,940
just such a small change

1382
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,880
Let these old people burn their meat

1383
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,840
get a big one

1384
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,740
So what I want to tell you now is

1385
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,480
a little fine-tuning

1386
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,580
so you and the guy next door

1387
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,880
You see you eat almost everything

1388
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,480
Why is one in shape and the other in poor health?

1389
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,980
The bad thing is this

1390
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,580
But this thing for the general public

1391
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,180
If it wasn't for everyone coming here today

1392
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,880
to the general public

1393
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,080
I want to talk to him face to face

1394
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:37,580
He doesn't even want to listen

1395
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,480
you know what i mean

1396
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,480
so you take care of yourself now

1397
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,380
it's not easy for you

1398
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:43,280
So I'm going to tell you about a software

1399
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,780
You can go in and carefully consider what you eat.

1400
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,780
worse than that standard

1401
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,180
It's a little bit worse, you can change it

1402
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,080
it will be of great help

1403
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,980
ok this is over here

1404
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,780
This paper only mentions that

1405
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,680
If you are someone with different calories

1406
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,580
Together

1407
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,560
1300 14000 15000 1600 to this

1408
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,960
You see, the amount of meals everyone eats is slightly different every day

1409
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,400
Your protein will go up slowly

1410
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,640
vegetables fruit and

1411
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,640
our word in taiwan

1412
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,160
Our suggested dairy class is stable

1413
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
no increase

1414
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,480
But on protein and protein

1415
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,920
There is a scaling like this

1416
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Then like this grease also goes up

1417
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,480
So this data is hard to remember.

1418
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,960
So you have to put your own data in

1419
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,400
then find your combination

1420
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,880
you just write it down

1421
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,280
keep for reference

1422
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,480
like this

1423
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,440
to do this

1424
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,680
then we are at the place of intervention

1425
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,000
how do we do it

1426
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,600
Then this step means that everyone can do it too.

1427
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,120
A practice that you can follow

1428
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,360
That is, after you see us coming in alone

1429
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,680
let's see first

1430
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,520
How tall and how heavy is he?

1431
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,520
is he male or female how old is he

1432
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,680
we'll know

1433
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,120
How many calories should this person eat

1434
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,240
I know how many calories he eats when

1435
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,880
I know how much he should eat

1436
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
How much meat and how much vegetables

1437
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,600
Just know how much oil and how much fruit

1438
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,600
We have such a data

1439
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,800
then this time

1440
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,200
we'll ask this guy

1441
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,200
that is, how do you usually eat

1442
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,500
he described

1443
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,000
After the description, we immediately recorded it on the computer.

1444
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,400
If you type a software, it will show his appearance.

1445
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,900
the appearance of what he eats

1446
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,900
If it's not enough, ask him to make it up

1447
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,900
After that we'll give him a personal prescription

1448
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,600
This personal prescription is very important

1449
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,000
It just feels like a watch

1450
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,300
But everyone knows that eating is an art.

1451
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,400
That is to say, you eat like this

1452
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,200
he eats like that

1453
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,400
I can't always tell you

1454
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,900
how many servings how many servings

1455
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,500
Then you won't do it when you go back

1456
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,900
So when we intervene

1457
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,200
we have personal

1458
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,500
discuss with him

1459
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,400
Just to see where he can change the most easily

1460
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,900
Just changed him like this

1461
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,400
is such a way

1462
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,600
In fact, it is not easy to do interventional research.

1463
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,700
He just knows he probably doesn't want to do it

1464
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,200
so intervening

1465
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,400
We also need to start talking to him about

1466
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,400
Hey, do you know you have debilitating disease?

1467
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,400
Hey, do you know what frailty is?

1468
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,920
Then he went to the hospital to test

1469
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,680
He couldn't walk so he went to the hospital

1470
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,200
He would have liked the doctor to help him

1471
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,840
But the doctor can't help with this disease

1472
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,320
So the doctor referred him to us

1473
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,320
then we told him

1474
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,320
Do you know your weakness

1475
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,320
is replyable

1476
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,320
but you have to cooperate with us

1477
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,820
you only need to eat nutrition

1478
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,320
you can reply

1479
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,320
After gaining such a trust from him

1480
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,320
We'll just tell him what to do after that

1481
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,320
After talking about how you should eat

1482
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,320
How to eat how to eat, then you have to ask him

1483
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,320
Will you have trouble doing this?

1484
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,320
He told people that he had difficulties

1485
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
Because I don't cook the food at home

1486
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:48,320
Or it means that my family usually buys this kind of thing

1487
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,320
Then we're going to work it out with him.

1488
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,320
these questions

1489
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,320
Then these problems are also encountered by everyone.

1490
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,320
You may have listened to the speech today and you go back and want to change it

1491
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,320
But your food is not made by you at all

1492
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,320
so you have to talk to your family

1493
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
the other half

1494
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,200
your child

1495
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,400
or your family

1496
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,000
Who is in charge to do a consultation

1497
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,400
discuss

1498
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,700
of course we have

1499
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,900
It depends on the level of understanding of Hirao's case.

1500
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,400
he has some unhappy things

1501
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,400
Let's let him vent his emotions, wait

1502
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,300
A methodology for nutrition education with a few, many

1503
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,200
to do

1504
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,400
Then track after the first month

1505
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,900
A methodology for repeating these nutrition education

1506
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,300
Ping Liang then let him release his emotions

1507
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,000
Build a supportive relationship with him

1508
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:32,500
Think of alternatives with him

1509
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
then one month to three months

1510
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,600
We also gave him some rewards

1511
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:39,500
Sign some consent forms with him too.

1512
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,100
Say I'm willing to change like this

1513
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,100
There are many methodologies in this

1514
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,900
Well then I'll be next

1515
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,600
start talking about this

1516
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,200
A tool we used at the time

1517
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,000
We used a standard dinner plate

1518
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,600
what about this plate

1519
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,800
is available

1520
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,800
this plate is

1521
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:55,900
if you are interested

1522
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,300
You can go online to Tang Diabetes Association

1523
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Maybe three or four hundred yuan.

1524
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Then its easy thing to do is

1525
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
it has three holes on this side

1526
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
if you should have one

1527
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
you should eat four

1528
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
If you have a few copies, you can fill it up.

1529
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Then this place is two servings of vegetables

1530
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
so it's one meal at a time

1531
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
such a plan

1532
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
then here

1533
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
here is

1534
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
This city meeting is the location of rice

1535
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
fruit location

1536
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
location of milk

1537
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
oil location

1538
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Each of our nutritionists

1539
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
We designed this for him

1540
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
This person will tell the nutritionist

1541
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
say what i eat

1542
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
The nutritionist probably drew a picture

1543
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
i found this guy

1544
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's all protein

1545
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
six servings of protein

1546
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
this is his night

1547
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I will eat so many dishes at noon

1548
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Such a dish at night

1549
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
he has two servings of vegetables

1550
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
His meal looks like this

1551
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
how much milk does he drink

1552
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
he has fried ham

1553
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
This ham dish is a bit oily

1554
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
fried vegetables with oil

1555
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
he's like that

1556
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
after evaluating it

1557
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
There is a number here

1558
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
this number

1559
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
This number can be compared with this person's

1560
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
actually

1561
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,100
Take it and check it

1562
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,300
What about after matching?

1563
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,140
we might just tell it again

1564
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,600
Your next three meals will be divided like this

1565
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,700
you have a glass of milk in the morning

1566
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,300
eat two slices of toast

1567
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,500
It is best to have a toast with some lotus fruit

1568
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,700
Whether it is placed separately or

1569
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,100
It's fruit toast

1570
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:18,100
Two servings of Chinese food

1571
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:20,600
a bit of meat and an egg

1572
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,900
then two servings of vegetables

1573
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,200
Served with whole bone rice and a fruit

1574
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,900
Then you can also pair a

1575
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,700
This dessert is like a yogurt for dessert

1576
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,100
Then dinner is two protein courses

1577
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,000
A dish like this

1578
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,300
a piece of fruit a whole bone meal

1579
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:39,500
Just help it make a plan like this

1580
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,300
For example, a person eats a lot

1581
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,400
2100 kcal

1582
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,700
it even has protein in the morning

1583
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,900
I ate porridge in the morning, etc.

1584
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,700
It is also a plan like this

1585
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:50,000
so a dinner plate like this

1586
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,400
You can also use this to help you

1587
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,700
For example, you should eat

1588
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,400
For example, four servings of protein

1589
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,400
That's four servings, about

1590
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
has an auxiliary effect

1591
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So in our study just now

1592
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Just use the same method just now for the nutritionist to use

1593
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
what about this plate

1594
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
We also sent each case a copy

1595
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
and we put food models on the plate

1596
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
This is 500 calories

1597
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Maybe a plate with 700 kcal

1598
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
We also gave it fruit and milk powder

1599
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Because it was done in the Miaoli area

1600
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
People in Miaoli do not drink milk powder very much

1601
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
And he is not used to buying wagashi

1602
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
so we want to say

1603
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It's better to send them when we start to intervene

1604
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Otherwise he might just listen

1605
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
So this is sending

1606
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
so that he can remember

1607
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
We also designed a restaurant

1608
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Let him take this restaurant home

1609
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
This is the size of a normal restaurant

1610
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
put him on the table

1611
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So he knows that 500 calories will look like this

1612
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
His family can also see

1613
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
His plate should look like this

1614
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
That 600 calories looks like this

1615
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So you can see that the difference is very small

1616
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,800
but everyone is different

1617
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,000
Then here are some references

1618
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,700
five hundred six hundred seven hundred and eight hundred

1619
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,800
That's a very small drawing

1620
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,600
Make some reference for his family

1621
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,700
But every old man wants to

1622
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,900
His meal might look like this

1623
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,600
OK so

1624
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,800
This is how we intervene

1625
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,900
but i'm going to talk a little bit about this

1626
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:20,800
This section provides individual prescriptions

1627
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,500
Because everyone eats differently

1628
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,300
we will encounter many problems

1629
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,800
For example, some people

1630
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,300
he just doesn't drink milk

1631
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,800
For example, we have to discuss with him

1632
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,200
There was an old man who said

1633
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,000
I drink three in one in the morning

1634
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,100
he speaks like this

1635
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,700
I drink three in one

1636
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,600
then we know he likes coffee

1637
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,400
so i told him

1638
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,300
Then why don't you go and buy some coffee powder?

1639
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,000
buy more brown sugar

1640
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,400
buy another can of milk powder

1641
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,500
you put the three together

1642
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,000
It's very similar to your three-in-one

1643
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,500
we'll make the suggestion

1644
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,200
Some people say I just don't eat fruit

1645
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:51,900
then you have to find a way

1646
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,800
then would you like

1647
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,500
For example, some dried fruit

1648
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,700
These things can also be replaced

1649
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,200
raisins or something

1650
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,900
Or really don't want to eat

1651
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,100
100% fruit juice though not the best

1652
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,400
is also an applied method

1653
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,900
it lacks protein

1654
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,800
Like, for example, I came across a case

1655
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,100
Of course, I'm not there to intervene there every day.

1656
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,000
I run over every week to have a look

1657
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,800
When encountering a case, it will tell me

1658
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,300
I have three highs, what protein do I eat?

1659
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,900
Then we have to tell it with evidence

1660
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:22,700
various scientific displays

1661
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,100
Protein can not only lower blood pressure

1662
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,300
Can also help control your blood sugar

1663
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,900
If you're eating the right kind of protein

1664
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,300
red meat

1665
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,500
If there are more tofu and fish

1666
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,200
Because cholesterol doesn't rise either

1667
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,500
talk to it

1668
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,400
some people have too much protein

1669
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,200
if too much

1670
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,100
You have to change the form of the dish

1671
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,400
For example, I always like big pieces of meat.

1672
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,900
Now you may have some dishes that use shredded pork

1673
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,100
as delicious

1674
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,300
So these are negotiable

1675
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,400
where to buy

1676
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,100
And some people are health conscious

1677
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,500
All dishes are hot

1678
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,800
We also have to tell it that this is not good

1679
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,100
you still have to use oil

1680
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
to cook because of the oil

1681
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,500
Provides calories for the elderly and has a full vitamin coat

1682
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,500
It's a good thing, why don't I use it all?

1683
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,500
It's wrong to cook all dishes hot

1684
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,500
So these kinds of questions are different for everyone.

1685
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,500
You have to break them one by one.

1686
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,000
So dietary intervention is really not easy

1687
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,500
if not do

1688
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
We saw many people on Wenyan

1689
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:27,000
After teaching people how to eat, there is no effect at all

1690
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,500
Just because he not only needs to know the prescription

1691
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
And also, that prescription needs to be personalized.

1692
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,500
but also in line with his personal form

1693
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:36,000
So I guess this is when you guys go back

1694
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,500
a problem that everyone will face

1695
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,500
Then this is what we ask the elderly to fill in every day

1696
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
how much did he eat

1697
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,500
When you fill in this every day

1698
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,500
It also reminds him again and again that he must meet the standard.

1699
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,500
OK so we just told you about this

1700
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,000
How is he in terms of nutritional entry research?

1701
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
That is to say, there are many literatures that provide caloric supplements

1702
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
or protein calorie supplement

1703
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,600
This kind of research generally tends to be good

1704
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,800
but not exactly the same

1705
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,500
Generally speaking, if this type of

1706
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,100
Recording research if paired with exercise

1707
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:11,600
Usually there are more positive effects

1708
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,600
But from our records study we found that

1709
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,900
If the principle of balanced diet

1710
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,500
Interventions that Provide Personalized Nutrition

1711
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,300
in the case of supplements such as it

1712
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,800
what we feel it is

1713
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,900
We found that it is possible to improve

1714
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,900
Overall nutritional status Post-fall status and level of depression

1715
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:33,400
and we have other single use nutrients

1716
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:37,900
This supplement is not as effective as the food itself

1717
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,900
This is one of our record research

1718
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,100
come to such a conclusion

1719
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:47,300
OK, after this point

1720
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,400
Then there is another issue of geriatric syndrome, which is

1721
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,500
Dementia

1722
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,700
We started to do this

1723
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:59,700
But in this so-called observation belief

1724
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,800
This step in data mining

1725
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,600
Let me do some simple summary for you

1726
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,700
That is, first of all, we take a look and we find that

1727
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:14,000
this so-called short intelligence test for the elderly

1728
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,200
There is a short test called MMSC

1729
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,000
It can measure all aspects of the intelligence of the elderly

1730
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,500
Then we have done something like this in Nutrition University

1731
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,500
We found that starting at age 65

1732
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
This intelligence will fall down

1733
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,800
male female or overall

1734
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,500
we use this score

1735
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:36,200
Come do some diet research with this

1736
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,200
that's in constitution

1737
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,400
If we look at the International Constitution, we find

1738
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,800
There are quite a lot of nutrients that are closely related to Shi Zhi

1739
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:48,000
Contains Vitamin B Complex Vitamin C Vitamin E Vitamin D

1740
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,400
There are also various plant chemicals

1741
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Then it's not the same as this debility

1742
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,600
Debilitating many clinical trials are doing protein

1743
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,300
But Shi Zhi's research is very little

1744
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:00,300
And it's all small

1745
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,700
research, now it is found that there are several studies

1746
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:08,100
Such research on delaying cognitive decline

1747
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:12,300
Effective research finds almost all in mild cognitive impairment

1748
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,600
It's just that it's starting to drop a little bit

1749
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,400
If it's serious, it's almost useless

1750
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,700
So this demented anti-intelligence is to find

1751
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:25,300
If it is too late, at most it will stop thinking and it won't get worse

1752
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,700
There is one study that is the most significant

1753
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,700
What it shows is that it can be almost with relative certainty

1754
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,600
It is the intervention of vitamin B group

1755
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:39,400
vitamin B group it has several B

1756
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:45,100
Like 8 folic acid Vitamin B2 Vitamin B6

1757
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:50,500
These are all related to the synthesis of our neurotransmitters

1758
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:54,400
Then this group B research is done

1759
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,700
There is a group B study my current author's name I forgot

1760
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,100
They do it very carefully and they use MR

1761
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,760
To measure the volume of the brain

1762
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,640
It was found that the head and nose group can significantly slow down this atrophy

1763
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,440
It is now the only study in the world

1764
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,600
This is what works great

1765
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,480
But we believe that influencing this

1766
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,360
There are many factors for this dementia

1767
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,880
just say it cuts in with nutrients

1768
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,160
is to see the nose group

1769
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,000
there are many more

1770
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,720
Now there are actually a lot of this

1771
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,880
Industry is

1772
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:36,840
Industry is called industry, it should be called manufacturer

1773
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,480
now i know

1774
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,880
Because I participated in a Shi Zhi Certification Conference in Europe last year

1775
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,840
They are developing some silver products

1776
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:46,040
Some silver items to see if they can help Shi Zhi

1777
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,720
There must be nose groups in that silver product.

1778
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,920
But with a lot of other things

1779
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,200
so this

1780
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,840
Then our laboratory is currently working on a mineral

1781
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,080
Look at its relationship with this dementia

1782
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,400
OK, what about the nutritional health survey?

1783
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,560
I also found that it was with this lion

1784
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,760
It's the people with low MMSC scores

1785
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,200
He's basically a lot of stuff

1786
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,280
very low heat

1787
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:19,360
Protein fat with carbohydrates B1 B2 B

1788
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,720
B3 is nice B6 B1 CDE

1789
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,920
Fake calcium core iron

1790
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,560
Fatty acids regardless of saturated units

1791
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,560
low cholesterol

1792
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,080
low fiber

1793
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,280
So here is a phenomenon that appears when people get old

1794
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,640
Usually not all heart disease in the past

1795
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:38,960
high cholesterol

1796
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,240
but by then

1797
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:41,520
You have heart disease and high cholesterol

1798
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,040
At that time, it was not high anymore. They all came down.

1799
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,760
So this time is to eat more

1800
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:47,640
To eat more is a key point

1801
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,040
So this is already entering another

1802
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,720
a question from the era

1803
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:53,960
What about diet?

1804
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,440
A little more research room

1805
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,000
other than the mediterranean diet

1806
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,840
There is another one called Deshu Diet

1807
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,040
this is the famous

1808
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,400
Our Blood Pressure Diet

1809
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,960
And these two combinations

1810
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,280
It is built by the Mediterranean Sea. The English name is Mediterranean.

1811
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,280
Teshu diet called Dash

1812
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,480
Just M and D

1813
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,800
It's the Maddie diet

1814
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,800
All three have been seen

1815
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,960
Protective effect on cognitive function

1816
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,800
but basically forward-looking

1817
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,600
is now to measure you have a diet like this

1818
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,600
You won't lose your mind easily

1819
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,360
like this

1820
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,120
What this diet emphasizes is

1821
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,880
Whole fruit and fruit seeds

1822
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,200
milk tea

1823
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,840
everyone looks like

1824
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,320
Acid meat disease is a bit like

1825
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:35,080
but not exactly the same

1826
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,240
There are milk eggs here, have you seen it?

1827
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:39,520
Just Acid Meat Syndrome has no dairy eggs at all

1828
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,400
Just sour flesh is the synthesis of muscle

1829
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:43,120
are all fish

1830
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,640
Shelfish is

1831
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,080
borrow class

1832
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,120
seafood

1833
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,640
something like this

1834
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,440
The same is the tea

1835
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,160
This is what the West sees

1836
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,240
then we Taiwan

1837
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,880
We also published an article

1838
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,920
is the most 2018

1839
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,440
It seems that only recently 2018 is an electronic file

1840
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,400
This is that Galliproof is the draft

1841
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,240
is the first edition of typesetting

1842
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,640
Later, it should be a study that came out at the beginning of this year.

1843
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,440
We are referring to the nutritional adjustment data

1844
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,880
It's always been said that if your score is demented

1845
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,400
just have this dementia score

1846
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,240
how is your diet

1847
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,360
Let's look at what you ate twenty years ago

1848
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,800
relationship with subsequent dementia

1849
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,640
To do this this paper brings together two studies

1850
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,920
As a result, we see that we divide men and women separately

1851
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,960
All found this rich image of diet type factor

1852
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,560
In terms of integration, of course, the sequence is a little different.

1853
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,880
In general, there are many fruits

1854
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,920
Lots of vegetables, lots of lotus seeds, lots of whole fruits and miscellaneous grains

1855
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,160
breakfast slices

1856
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,920
The most important thing is that Yan sells the film

1857
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:55,160
Eggs Dairy Seafood Tea & Coffee

1858
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,400
This one looks like Shulton

1859
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,520
Like the Maddie Diet with Shulton

1860
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
very much like frailty but you can see

1861
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Egg

1862
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
This appearance of the egg, the appearance of the milk egg

1863
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I want to say it's an interventional study with that group B.

1864
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
There is a mutual echo, that is, the B group is related to the brain

1865
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:16,000
So the protein that comes out here will have eggs

1866
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
dairy comes out very clearly

1867
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Then there are also tea and coffee

1868
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That tea and coffee are the same

1869
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Orthocarcin is very rich in Orthocarcin, which has antioxidant energy

1870
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
And there's some caffeine in it for a drink like this

1871
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So after I see a result like this

1872
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
I think the diet of the last group of the elderly can be integrated

1873
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Because frailty is not that different from dementia

1874
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
It is these proteins that must be taken care of

1875
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
it's probably almost

1876
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So what we just talked about in the dementia part is

1877
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,000
We found that the caloric intake of elderly people with dementia is low

1878
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Significantly lower levels of many trace elements

1879
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Including those things that should not be high

1880
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
like cholesterol and saturated fat

1881
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Originally, we all said that it must be low and low.

1882
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Now both of those things are down too

1883
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
also lowered

1884
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
On the contrary, it means your cholesterol, but don’t limit it

1885
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Don't limit the meat

1886
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Because now it's just a matter of eating too little

1887
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
What about the elderly with good cognitive function?

1888
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
We just saw fresh fruit

1889
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Wagyu whole milk protein rich food

1890
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Like men are fish and sea bream

1891
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Women are eggs or soy products

1892
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and tea and coffee

1893
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
a form of sauce

1894
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So what we have in Taiwan is different from the international ones.

1895
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
is very consistent

1896
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
In addition, prospective studies

1897
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I just talked about prospective studies

1898
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
we have another profile

1899
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
found that 20 years ago in the 1990s

1900
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
If these people happen to be

1901
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
If you like to eat fish and drink tea

1902
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
He was in 2000 2010

1903
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
less risk of dementia

1904
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
So there is a long-term and a short-term

1905
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
there is a little different news

1906
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
In the long run, it starts from middle age

1907
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Of course you want to prevent cardiovascular disease

1908
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
This kind of thing like three high

1909
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
let this risk down

1910
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Then this I believe this plays such a role

1911
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
but in the short term

1912
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
You need to get enough nutrients

1913
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Group B is enough

1914
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
enough protein

1915
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
tea or enough

1916
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
These two are somewhat similar but

1917
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
different face

1918
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
so we just

1919
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Combining the above information?

1920
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
We're in the National Construction Agency's program

1921
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
we suggest

1922
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
The key to the prevention and treatment of geriatric syndrome

1923
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Diet content

1924
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
should mean

1925
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
The first point

1926
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,000
You must balance the six categories

1927
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Then of course we have to deal with those who set up twelve

1928
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
The allocation of these six categories should be adjusted

1929
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
We must emphasize what I just said

1930
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Vegetables, Nuts, Seeds, Mushrooms, Milk

1931
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,700
and protein-rich foods

1932
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,400
with healthy tea

1933
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,700
In terms of protein, what is better for the elderly?

1934
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,000
Fish and seafood include excuses

1935
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,560
What about eggs, beans, meat?

1936
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,900
Less red meat but I must say

1937
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:19,300
We didn't see red meat in our film and television mentality just now

1938
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:21,220
but it means to say

1939
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:24,060
People who eat less red meat

1940
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,900
Other people who eat a lot of meat are good

1941
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,600
But let's analyze these carefully

1942
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,200
People with fewer lions and less lean meat

1943
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,500
Does he eat red meat? He still does.

1944
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,300
So I want to emphasize again

1945
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:38,200
I'm not telling you to go back

1946
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,200
Just eat white meat

1947
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,800
And then there's just these things, no pork at all

1948
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,300
i definitely didn't mean that

1949
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:47,500
Because our Taiwanese society

1950
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,300
Pork is a major protein

1951
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:53,000
Its whole suggested implication is that

1952
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,400
Pork and other proteins should be evenly distributed

1953
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,500
Not much pork, absolutely not much

1954
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,100
but not at all

1955
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
The reason I remind everyone is because

1956
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,620
in taiwanese

1957
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:07,300
Pork is a major source of vitamin B1

1958
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,000
Can't say not to rule it all out

1959
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,360
don't go don't do anything

1960
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,600
don't go too far

1961
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,960
we're talking about a trend

1962
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,260
so understand

1963
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,840
OK, so our intervention goal

1964
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,000
We are doing the same in the community now

1965
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,800
The first time we met an old man

1966
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,240
We're going to estimate his personal calories

1967
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,240
Then we understand his six categories of allocation

1968
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,700
we are going to tell him

1969
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,360
and then assign it

1970
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,160
How to adjust the distribution of the four major food categories of his main meal

1971
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,000
what kind of staple food

1972
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,200
what kind of entree

1973
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,360
what kind of vegetables

1974
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,800
what kind of fruit to match

1975
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,700
What about the allocation?

1976
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:48,120
we would recommend using some

1977
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,360
This kind of dinner plate in three-dimensional space

1978
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,160
you can easily understand

1979
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,120
Then we ordinary people

1980
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:55,040
you can buy one

1981
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,440
after understanding

1982
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,200
Been yours for a while

1983
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,000
Quantity is in your head

1984
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,480
Where do you go out in the future, let alone take it with you

1985
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,980
probably will know

1986
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:08,000
That's another way to creatively

1987
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,480
There are some things you may not normally be used to

1988
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:13,480
You have to have some imagination and creativity since childhood

1989
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,180
mix it in

1990
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:17,480
this event we

1991
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,480
Many friends are playing all day long

1992
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:20,680
how to play this match how to match

1993
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,880
Then post it on Facebook.

1994
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,480
Then pass it back and forth in LINE

1995
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,800
Very interesting

1996
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,600
This can be turned into an event

1997
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,100
So at the caring base

1998
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:32,900
we tell old people

1999
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,900
Just say you must press your own heat

2000
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,500
eat enough

2001
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:40,100
You have to balance the six high-quality categories

2002
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,200
what does this mean

2003
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,000
That is, every type of food must be eaten

2004
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,200
but no more no less

2005
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:48,000
Of course, the type of food is to be diversified.

2006
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,600
Strive for change

2007
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,200
Then each category must choose high density

2008
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,700
Let's talk a little bit about the high density

2009
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,400
For example, white rice is low density

2010
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,200
All shares are high density

2011
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,200
It is nutrient dense

2012
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Everyone understands this, it is high density and low density.

2013
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Over processed is low density, under processed is high density

2014
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So if you really want to eat healthy, sometimes you have to do it yourself

2015
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Like me, although I am so busy, I am doing research at Academia Sinica

2016
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I cook it myself for my family every breakfast and every dinner

2017
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Ready to leave the office at 5:30 and rush home to cook dinner for the whole family

2018
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Because I want to make sure I eat healthy and my family eats healthy

2019
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
So it's good to do it a little bit

2020
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
good condition for a busy job

2021
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
A glass of plant drink a day

2022
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
So this is to say that eating enough calories means eating enough

2023
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Eat enough calories, eat enough, high-quality big food is good to eat

2024
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Last but not least because you might not be able to eat it

2025
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
or when it's time to eat, so the events we do in the community

2026
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
It is to teach the old man to know his dinner plate, to teach the old man to know whole grains

2027
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
we still have tea over there

2028
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
cultural promotion

2029
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,700
That is to say, I want him to drink tea again

2030
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,000
I want him to drink milk again

2031
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,300
Then just make a milk tea culture

2032
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,000
or latte culture

2033
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,200
teach them how to make tea

2034
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,700
And what are the desserts that go with the tea?

2035
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,300
It's like dried fruit, lotus fruit, etc.

2036
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,400
that's very healthy

2037
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,400
Take the milk and lotus fruit that they can't eat

2038
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,400
eat it all

2039
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,700
Some old people can't eat the fruits and vegetables

2040
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:25,000
How to eat it creatively

2041
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,100
Of course, most young people will use some

2042
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,300
Fruit and vegetable juice, yogurt like this, these

2043
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,500
The old man may not be able to

2044
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,300
What method does the old man use?

2045
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,300
For example, a situation in our family is

2046
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,300
my mother

2047
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,100
My mother is a hundred years old now

2048
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,100
she is also very healthy

2049
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,400
But she does eat less

2050
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,400
So for example, the day before she

2051
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,900
If there are vegetables left over from lunch or dinner

2052
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,600
then we'll collect it

2053
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,900
freeze it well

2054
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,000
For example, the next morning

2055
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,800
i'll chop it up

2056
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,300
then with an egg

2057
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,000
turn into vegetable eggs

2058
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,200
Then put it on three sides of her

2059
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
For example like this

2060
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Then you just make sure he gets the vegetables

2061
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
will eat

2062
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
This is an example

2063
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
What about fruit?

2064
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
That is my mother only

2065
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
that appetite

2066
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
fruit that can only be eaten once

2067
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
He can't eat in the afternoon and evening

2068
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
So I must carry a bowl of fruit for him for breakfast

2069
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
that's it

2070
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
if i go home at noon

2071
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I'll pour him a glass

2072
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
100 percent orange juice

2073
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
put on the table

2074
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
He will see it when he wakes up at noon

2075
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
i'm busy

2076
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,000
if i forget

2077
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
i go home at night

2078
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Arrive home at half past five

2079
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
I'll pour a glass first

2080
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
100 percent orange juice

2081
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
or grape juice

2082
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
put it over there

2083
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
just ask him to drink first

2084
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
then wait until i make dinner

2085
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
that is to say

2086
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
so-called creativity

2087
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
if you want

2088
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
what can't be done

2089
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
there is

2090
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
View Breakfast for the Elderly

2091
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
this is very important

2092
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
because the old and the young

2093
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
The difference is that

2094
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
you young man can

2095
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I don't eat a meal

2096
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
then i have dinner or lunch

2097
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
pile of protein

2098
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
fill it up

2099
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
then my body can take it

2100
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
and I always

2101
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
My muscle nuclear ability is all in

2102
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
But the old man did not eat this meal

2103
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
He just lost that opportunity to do the synthesis of chicken

2104
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Therefore, what is important is that the elderly should eat protein from breakfast

2105
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Meal distribution

2106
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
It is best to have vegetables, fruits and protein in all three meals

2107
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
ensure the metabolism of his body

2108
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
The synthesis of protein chicken is in the best state

2109
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
so we have a moment that is old age breakfast

2110
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Teach them how to eat breakfast and how to match it

2111
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:34,000
This is a formula we promote in the community

2112
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
they still read

2113
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I don't know if I click it

2114
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
thank you all

2115
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
awesome

2116
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
ok this is right there

2117
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I've been working on this project for the past two years

2118
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
The effect will not be known until the end of the year

2119
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
This weakness of these old people

2120
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Is there any progress in all aspects?

2121
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
OK, let me see the time

2122
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
It should be almost

2123
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So now let's talk about this website

2124
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
what about this website

2125
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
is if people want to know your own

2126
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Six categories of book distribution

2127
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
you can in google

2128
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I didn't leave the URL

2129
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
You are in Google

2130
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Hit this Zhongyan Nutrition Information Website

2131
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
just hit this

2132
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It will run out like this screen

2133
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
This picture is

2134
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Just fill in your age here

2135
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
your gender

2136
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
how tall are you

2137
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
how many kilograms

2138
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
and your physical activity

2139
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
It has low fever low moderately higher

2140
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
make a choice

2141
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Then here is the description

2142
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
who is low

2143
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
who is low fever

2144
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
For example, if you say low

2145
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
This means most of the time

2146
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
They all sit and study, do homework, and talk

2147
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Watch TV or listen to music part of the time

2148
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
There is a small process of walking and other calorie consumption for an hour.

2149
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
This one hour, for example, matching

2150
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
For example, if you walk to take the bus

2151
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
then go home what

2152
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
or walking around the house for about an hour

2153
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
So this is low

2154
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Then if the fever is low, it means

2155
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Except just like this

2156
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
There will be about two hours of walking

2157
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Then moderation means that in addition to the above

2158
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
You still have an hour of vigorous work

2159
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
or such a caloric expenditure

2160
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
An hour of activity at a fast pace

2161
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Calorie-intensive activities

2162
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
For example, if you play ball for an hour

2163
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
this will be moderate

2164
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
but every day

2165
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
If you only call twice a week

2166
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,000
you're sick

2167
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
this is every day

2168
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
If it is high, it means high-intensity activities every day.

2169
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,700
You probably look where you belong

2170
01:28:02,700 --> 01:28:04,600
It will do a calculation for you

2171
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:05,900
Here the calculation would say

2172
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,300
how tall are you for a man

2173
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,600
how much weight

2174
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,300
What is your BMI approximately?

2175
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,800
Although you are normal now

2176
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,300
but

2177
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,900
i would suggest you

2178
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:18,400
It is best to reach BMI22

2179
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,800
That is, how much weight

2180
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,300
at this weight

2181
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,800
Do you need 2099 calories a day

2182
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,900
That's about 2100, right?

2183
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,100
So there are two classes on this side

2184
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:30,800
tell you

2185
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,600
You're probably somewhere in between

2186
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,200
directly between the two

2187
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,500
What kind of state is it?

2188
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,600
is that you may eat every day

2189
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,300
Three or three and a half bowls of rice

2190
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:40,600
divide by three

2191
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:41,600
just a bowl

2192
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,900
more bowls of rice

2193
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,500
In this, I hope it means

2194
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:48,000
at least one bowl is

2195
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,700
this

2196
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,800
No refinement is what is called

2197
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,100
something like brown rice

2198
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:53,500
in this way

2199
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,400
Then you wish you every day

2200
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,000
have a drink or two

2201
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,900
Just a cup and a half of milk

2202
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,100
Then your tofu

2203
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,800
About six servings of meat and eggs

2204
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,600
The word six copies is the spacer I just mentioned

2205
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,560
Allocation of six like this

2206
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:07,160
You see it is assigned to three three

2207
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:08,700
Four plates of vegetables

2208
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,000
Three to three and a half servings of fruit

2209
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:11,900
6 servings of nut seeds

2210
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,060
This is more difficult to understand

2211
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:14,200
I can tell you about this

2212
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,000
What does it mean

2213
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,300
Just the nut seed that one of you has a serving of each day

2214
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:21,800
What does the remaining five mean?

2215
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:25,100
That is, you have five dishes in the four dishes every day

2216
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,000
it is fried in oil

2217
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,800
So every day if you

2218
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:31,700
You see, four servings of vegetables are already four dishes.

2219
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,400
And six servings of bean, fish, meat and eggs

2220
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,100
there are ten

2221
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,300
that is to say

2222
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,700
Not every dish is fried with oil

2223
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,900
half is good

2224
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,500
For example, some of my fish today are steamed

2225
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,800
some are fried

2226
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,100
fried with oil

2227
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,200
steamed without oil

2228
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,500
baked without oil

2229
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,900
If the vegetables are cold

2230
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:49,500
no oil

2231
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,300
no oil

2232
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:51,400
fried with oil

2233
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,100
so the dish you have is salad

2234
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,900
some dishes are fried

2235
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:57,300
some are hot

2236
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,900
only half of the dish

2237
01:29:58,900 --> 01:29:59,900
whether it is faint

2238
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Half of it is made of oil

2239
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
But that oil is not a restaurant

2240
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Let's go to the restaurant and order a dish

2241
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Isn't that the whole dish soaked in oil?

2242
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
it's not like that

2243
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It's almost the oil level of a buffet

2244
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
I know only half is oily

2245
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Then your oil level is just right.

2246
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
some people are healthy

2247
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
No cooking oil

2248
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
no no no way

2249
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
then you can be at your healthiest

2250
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It is your six servings that all use Heguo seeds

2251
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
The most important thing is that it is possible

2252
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Every dish of yours is a salad

2253
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Your salad is hot

2254
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
this can also

2255
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
So these are where the creativity

2256
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
good so

2257
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Speaking of this

2258
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I think it's about the same time

2259
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It's about ninety minutes

2260
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
right

2261
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
May I

2262
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
thank you very much

2263
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Ask Professor Han's very informative lecture

2264
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
then we now

2265
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
ask questions

2266
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,340
If you ask this question, we will give you a copy

2267
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,840
I think it's a magazine for scientists.

2268
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:08,640
Thank you all for asking

2269
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:09,740
So another one can do

2270
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:13,740
Thank you, Professor Pan, for your in-depth introduction.

2271
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,940
I want to ask Professor Pan

2272
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:18,640
That is to say, on page 18 of your talk about Bubbles just now

2273
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,940
After the so-called old people there are weak

2274
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:25,340
His activity decreased, his diet decreased

2275
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:26,940
it's a vicious circle

2276
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Ask Professor Pan

2277
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Ask Professor Pan

2278
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Ask Professor Pan

2279
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Ask Professor Pan

2280
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Ask Professor Pan

2281
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Ask Professor Pan

2282
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,000
It's the English part

2283
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
The professor just mentioned that

2284
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
It is hoped to increase the activity and amount of exercise of the elderly

2285
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
to stimulate his appetite to increase his diet

2286
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
to break the cycle

2287
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
but if say

2288
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Our caregivers fall into a myth

2289
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
just say it's because you're unlucky

2290
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So I use forced fasting

2291
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Just use bio fasting, forced fasting

2292
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I cut off so much in a row

2293
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
People can't break this cycle when it's like this

2294
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
i will ask several questions

2295
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
so my first question

2296
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
let the professor answer

2297
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Then I ask the second question

2298
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I'll ask another question when I get a chance

2299
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Thanks

2300
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
by force

2301
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Because I personally don't recommend

2302
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
But none of us did either

2303
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
It's just that I didn't pay attention to whether there is such a test

2304
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
what if there is no test

2305
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It's not good to say it's impossible

2306
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:39,000
But that is to say, if you analyze a state where the elderly cannot eat

2307
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It eats so little that it can't eat it

2308
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
space in its stomach

2309
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It doesn't have enough digestion for anything

2310
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
so in this case

2311
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I believe in forced fasting

2312
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
May have some adverse effects

2313
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
so of course i

2314
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Because we didn't enter into such a trial

2315
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Can't eat the old man

2316
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,600
As long as there is a group, it is forced

2317
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,640
so i'm having a hard time

2318
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,240
Indeed, your question is really difficult

2319
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,280
hard to answer

2320
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,880
but we know that

2321
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,080
When the old man can't eat

2322
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,280
If you force him to eat, he will feel uncomfortable

2323
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,080
Because we're talking about aging now

2324
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:18,640
So the stroke after aging

2325
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:19,840
what those radar teams

2326
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,640
Then he will swallow

2327
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,840
But we often meet evildoers and say

2328
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,880
Then I just have to wait for the break, after the break

2329
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,680
He can live for several years

2330
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,400
just lie there

2331
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,640
Just lay there and live for several years.

2332
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,400
So the myth here goes like this

2333
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,040
That's why I asked this question

2334
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,240
But what I would suggest is to say

2335
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,560
I just said break

2336
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,040
not in this way

2337
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,880
break means

2338
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,400
For example, we are in Miaoli Hospital

2339
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,440
we'll find out now

2340
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,440
What's wrong with these old men's reclining strength?

2341
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:46,680
we designed some

2342
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,400
easy exercise for him

2343
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,800
he started doing it

2344
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,240
when he first did

2345
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,320
his physical exertion

2346
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,560
he will start to want to eat

2347
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,480
I think this is a

2348
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,200
smarter way

2349
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:58,520
and you

2350
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,080
you change the quality of food

2351
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
you can design

2352
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
This food is more dance-like

2353
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
That is to say, it uses a small volume

2354
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
it won't last

2355
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
eat that nutrition

2356
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
These two methods will

2357
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
I think it will be better

2358
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
the next page

2359
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
The so-called protein American gluten body weight

2360
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Calculation standard of the body weight of the American gluten

2361
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
based on its current weight

2362
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Or ideal weight ID28 Liwet

2363
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
still have to count the weight

2364
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Lin8 Liwet

2365
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
dimensional basis to calculate its heavy protein requirement

2366
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Thanks

2367
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
This is now internationally

2368
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Usually the current weight

2369
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
We are also useful Lin8 LiMes

2370
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
also counted

2371
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
basically the same one

2372
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
same trend

2373
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
but this is currently

2374
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Currently because it is in this clinical

2375
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
more useful method

2376
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
It is directly minus the weight

2377
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I understand that you should fully understand this question

2378
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Is you considering Lin8 LiMes

2379
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,200
body mass may be more important

2380
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,200
all good questions

2381
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:14,400
Many thanks to Yuan Pan for the report

2382
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,400
Then I want to say that in this life

2383
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,600
It is the history of birth and disease

2384
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,400
come here to eat such good food

2385
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:26,100
Until the last nine years old and one hundred years old, they are all gone

2386
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:30,700
I want to take advantage of your report

2387
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:33,500
do an extended role

2388
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:36,500
The question until that day is

2389
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,700
stop breathing

2390
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:39,100
that problem is too big

2391
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:40,900
I want to extend that

2392
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,300
by Namoban

2393
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:45,200
Scarmorivo

2394
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,300
there's a world we can go to

2395
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:49,000
is the brightest world

2396
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,500
life is infinite

2397
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,600
That is to say, the Western Paradise

2398
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:53,700
Amitabha

2399
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,900
So the theory starts out pretty big

2400
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,900
it's not oriental

2401
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,100
it is a science

2402
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,100
great knowledge

2403
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,500
So Master Xuanzang traveled from Xi'an to India during the Tang Dynasty

2404
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,000
It took a few years to arrive

2405
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
It took a total of 17 years to return from studying in India

2406
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
He has brought back many life theories of Buddhist managers

2407
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,500
Like what Wu Liang said, the Diamond Sutra and so on

2408
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,000
very great experience

2409
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,500
then these classics

2410
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,500
Then everyone can solve their own problems

2411
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:25,000
Meet your long-term needs

2412
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,500
That is to say, watch these classics on TV

2413
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,500
Then there are many mages like Jing Kong mage

2414
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,500
Master Haitao came to help us explain

2415
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:36,500
Only when a mage explains it can we understand

2416
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,500
There's such a wonderful world we can go to

2417
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,500
I believe that many people here have learned Amitabha

2418
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,000
Then another question

2419
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,500
Our research unit is studying this excellent

2420
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:55,500
At this time, is there any religion or the Buddhist law I just talked about?

2421
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,500
Introduced to study how to solve outstanding problems

2422
01:36:58,500 --> 01:36:59,500
then i will share

2423
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
If you encounter excellent

2424
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
forget about that now

2425
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Immediately transform the new realm into

2426
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Amitabha

2427
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
so new is close

2428
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
there is no such thing

2429
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Thank you Amitabha

2430
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
ok thank you for sharing

2431
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
let's see if

2432
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
who has some questions

2433
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Excuse me

2434
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
That is what the professor just mentioned

2435
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
proper food and drink

2436
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
tea coffee

2437
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
even the so-called wine

2438
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
suggested by the professor

2439
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
the so-called appropriate amount

2440
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,000
what is the appropriate amount

2441
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:42,000
that's it

2442
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
so-called tea coffee

2443
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Even wine, red wine, etc.

2444
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
the so-called appropriate amount

2445
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
because of coffee

2446
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
is what we know to say

2447
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
When doing volume

2448
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
would cause the so-called

2449
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
stop loss stop neglect

2450
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
that's again

2451
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
other deteriorating part of debilitating

2452
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
That's why the professor suggested

2453
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
the so-called appropriate amount

2454
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Then it's protein

2455
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Can't talk about the so-called milk powder, right?

2456
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Milk powder is a remanufactured product

2457
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
That milk powder and the so-called fresh milk

2458
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It's in making this about our nutrition

2459
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Is there a difference in the scenery difference?

2460
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Thanks

2461
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
because we are today

2462
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
discuss this issue

2463
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
it has a bit of what it should say

2464
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
is that it is a political

2465
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Because it this food is a

2466
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
very complicated thing

2467
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
it can't be like a

2468
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
so-called basic research

2469
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
That is to say one thing at a time

2470
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
because it is very complicated

2471
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
So we usually when making recommendations

2472
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
from this information

2473
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
see what can be seen

2474
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
let's make suggestions

2475
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
that is to say it is not easy

2476
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
so-called heterodyne

2477
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Or extend up and down

2478
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Then when I was looking at our profile

2479
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I find

2480
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
The so-called group that eats a lot like tea

2481
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
in this way

2482
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
it is about

2483
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
in this way

2484
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
so the coffee is over there

2485
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Taiwanese people eat less coffee after all

2486
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Its relevance is like this

2487
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
coffee is usually

2488
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,000
These chitons are just two or three cups a week

2489
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
But the tea is almost drunk to a cup a day

2490
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,000
So now I can say that

2491
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Based on our current political observation

2492
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
the state of this crowd

2493
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Looks like a cup of tea a day would be nice

2494
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
and I think the main effect

2495
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
probably from tea

2496
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:26,000
because it is a pattern

2497
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
it is relevant

2498
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
But you will see that there is still less coffee in that range

2499
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
I don't know if Taiwanese really

2500
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
When Westerners drink so much coffee

2501
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
what will happen

2502
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
So I must say that when I was talking about this thing today

2503
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I think it depends on your personal physique

2504
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
But if I want to promote this thing

2505
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I will focus on tea

2506
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Because it is more tea

2507
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
this is your first question

2508
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
as for a little more

2509
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
I believe there is no problem

2510
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
as long as you are drinking

2511
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I still feel that the body can adapt

2512
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Like some people the coffee is good though

2513
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
but some people can't drink coffee

2514
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,500
can't drink

2515
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,500
basically

2516
01:40:02,500 --> 01:40:03,500
just because it's a

2517
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:04,700
how to say

2518
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:05,700
This is Observation

2519
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,800
is a human

2520
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,200
Natural Experiments

2521
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,000
a thing of nature experiment

2522
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,300
So we can't go beyond it too much

2523
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:15,500
so this is the first question

2524
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,000
I just forgot the second one

2525
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:18,600
milk powder

2526
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:20,400
Yeah

2527
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:22,000
this is indeed

2528
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
A fresh milk has this structure of this protein

2529
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:26,100
with milk powder

2530
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,300
because milk powder

2531
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,200
put moisture like this

2532
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:30,200
evaporate

2533
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,200
Its structure is indeed different

2534
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:33,800
but i must say

2535
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,000
I because I am studying nutrition training

2536
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,400
We usually focus on nutrition

2537
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,000
The problem with this structure involves

2538
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,000
This immune allergy

2539
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,400
It's not my major

2540
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,700
but we found

2541
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:48,700
That is to say, in nutrition

2542
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:50,100
milk powder and fresh milk

2543
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:52,600
It seems that there is not much difference

2544
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,000
that is

2545
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,400
For protein intake

2546
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:56,500
calcium intake

2547
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,100
So if it is beyond this range

2548
01:40:59,100 --> 01:40:59,700
of

2549
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
When it comes to allergies, it's not my field.

2550
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But I feel there is no difference in nutrition

2551
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
You said you have to walk steadily, right?

2552
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
oh

2553
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Weak feet will fall

2554
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
In fact, I believe there are many reasons

2555
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
But if you're talking about what we're talking about today

2556
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
this debilitating word of encouragement

2557
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
that big problem

2558
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
OK, what we are talking about today is the issue of motivation

2559
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Because you see the protein I talked about today

2560
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
There is also protein, which is a raw material for muscle synthesis

2561
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Then we mentioned that fruits and vegetables are anti-inflammatory

2562
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
We all know why old people talk to young people

2563
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,020
Eat the same protein but your muscle synthesis doesn't

2564
01:42:03,020 --> 01:42:06,140
It's because your body is in a state of inflammation

2565
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:08,980
Your synthesis side is weaker

2566
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,340
Therefore, there must be antioxidant

2567
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:15,220
It will be better if it is provided together with protein

2568
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,980
But if a person is already weak enough

2569
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:21,420
It must be paired with exercise

2570
01:42:21,420 --> 01:42:23,500
is that you have to match some breaks

2571
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:24,700
so in this

2572
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,620
We're in the middle of this Selary study

2573
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:29,100
We have four types of sports

2574
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:31,220
The middle one is muscle strength

2575
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,860
Main resistance exercise, strength training and stretching exercise

2576
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:35,740
There are soft exercises and aerobic

2577
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,300
all four

2578
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,980
Then there are upper and lower limbs

2579
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:42,180
There are such sports

2580
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,380
so if you

2581
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:45,780
Your weakness is not due to structural problems

2582
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:47,180
or neurological problems

2583
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:49,900
If the muscles are weak

2584
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:52,180
You should start to practice the underhand

2585
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:53,420
some movement in the lower body

2586
01:42:53,420 --> 01:42:55,900
including things like squats

2587
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:59,260
Then ask a sports coach

2588
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,060
can be practiced

2589
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
But light nutrition is not enough

2590
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:06,740
big problem you tell him

2591
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,240
Any question

2592
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,240
yes

2593
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:11,240
please

2594
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,740
black tea

2595
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,740
green tea

2596
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:15,740
yes

2597
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:18,240
There are black tea and green tea, right?

2598
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:18,740
yes

2599
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:21,740
What about green tea?

2600
01:43:21,740 --> 01:43:23,240
pure green tea

2601
01:43:23,240 --> 01:43:25,240
and light green tea

2602
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,240
that black tea

2603
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:29,240
some are grape tea

2604
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:31,240
some are grape tea

2605
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,240
So black tea is better?

2606
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,240
Is green tea better?

2607
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,240
In terms of nutrition and moisture

2608
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,240
no difference

2609
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:41,240
because

2610
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:43,240
because i should say the same

2611
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,240
It is because of our research

2612
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,240
This is an epidemiological study

2613
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,240
If you really want me to divide it so finely

2614
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:50,240
I have no way

2615
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:52,240
So I see from our data that

2616
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:53,240
no difference

2617
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,240
But I believe there must be some

2618
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:56,240
slight difference

2619
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,240
But that difference is

2620
01:43:57,240 --> 01:43:58,240
I can't answer today

2621
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:00,240
there's still something like that

2622
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
vitamin c problem

2623
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
So why isn't vitamin C a problem?

2624
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It is because people in Taiwan

2625
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Your Designated Amount of Vitamin C

2626
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It has reached two or three hundred times your daily demand

2627
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
you know we do research

2628
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
just doesn't matter

2629
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
high is okay

2630
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
but that means we are

2631
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
已經 go go go

2632
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
us

2633
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
But that doesn't mean

2634
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
You can't take vitamin C supplements

2635
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
it's two different things

2636
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
So I think the vitamin C thing is relatively small

2637
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Then the advantages of this check

2638
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Definitely not only in this flesh-wrestling disease

2639
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Like our market and do some other research

2640
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
like ever done i did npc bni

2641
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Diet Patterns for BNI

2642
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
An intermediate protective factor is to check

2643
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Then I have the impression that all kinds of checks are protected

2644
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Cha is really a very good

2645
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Various chronic life

2646
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
It has a preventive effect

2647
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
contains cancer

2648
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
the teacher has another question

2649
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
usually when drinking tea

2650
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
drink tea like me

2651
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Because I have been drinking tea for about twenty years

2652
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,360
I don't dare to drink tea so far

2653
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:03,920
why

2654
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,360
After drinking, there will often be a phenomenon of willingness

2655
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,280
Is it the same with drinking coffee?

2656
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:19,840
No coffee should be no

2657
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,840
Coffee should be an opposite in this piece

2658
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,920
Because there are some other minerals in coffee

2659
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,680
it will help you have a bowel movement

2660
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:31,800
So I don't want to be constipated by tea

2661
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,320
we are other

2662
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,200
we don't have this experience

2663
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,760
Maybe this is a condition of a constitution that varies from person to person

2664
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,320
yes

2665
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,440
there is one behind

2666
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:44,720
Excuse me

2667
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,040
You have contributed here says

2668
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:48,960
The fourth said the anti-inflammatory food

2669
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,840
I want to ask about the sweets

2670
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:54,480
Will it make that body inflamed?

2671
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:59,240
Sweets are an inflammatory food

2672
01:45:59,240 --> 01:45:59,840
Yes

2673
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Yes

2674
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:04,160
What are anti-inflammatory foods

2675
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,360
Anti-inflammatory foods we usually are

2676
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:08,700
fruits and vegetables

2677
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:11,000
It is absolutely anti-inflammatory

2678
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,600
then again

2679
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,360
like fish

2680
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,440
picture

2681
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,940
this piece of oil

2682
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:19,240
fat part

2683
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:20,940
that is, every type of food

2684
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:22,140
can talk like this

2685
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:24,640
I just said that the first one is vegetables and fruits

2686
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,400
anti-inflammatory

2687
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,200
So what about fat?

2688
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,240
saturation

2689
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:29,500
Unsaturated

2690
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:30,760
and

2691
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:32,000
this

2692
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,060
just how to say

2693
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:37,100
As for the oil, it tends to be plant-based

2694
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,360
vegetable oil

2695
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,260
Then

2696
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:40,960
with fish oil

2697
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:43,360
But what about vegetable oil and fish oil?

2698
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,260
Is fish oil more anti-inflammatory

2699
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:48,160
But fish oil probably can't eat too much like this

2700
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:49,760
mean to say

2701
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:51,500
In terms of general sneezing oil

2702
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:53,060
we lean towards vegetable oil

2703
01:46:53,060 --> 01:46:55,460
But if the vegetable oil says

2704
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:56,860
olive oil

2705
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:58,060
canola oil

2706
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:00,120
and these soybean oils

2707
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,600
In other words, olive oil is the only advantage

2708
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,000
Another advantage because it is more antioxidant

2709
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:08,800
What about soybean oil?

2710
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:12,400
If you use stir-fried salad

2711
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,600
The use of these methods is also ok

2712
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,000
But that soybean oil

2713
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
sunflower oil these if used at high temperature

2714
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,600
it is less inflammatory

2715
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,400
It's a little bit complicated, it's a little bit complicated

2716
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,500
Good cleanser oils are very inflammatory

2717
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,500
absolutely can't eat

2718
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,400
Now Qinghuayou government has legislated

2719
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,000
take it out of food

2720
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,400
It has been in law for almost three years

2721
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,600
It should be three years

2722
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,400
That is, after three years, high-speed manufacturers

2723
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,700
A complete ban is probably the closest

2724
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:45,500
Three years ago, it was enacted that no cleaning oil should be used

2725
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,500
to the limit of hell

2726
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,200
Then I see I don't know yet

2727
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:53,400
What did not expect is basically oil

2728
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,300
Vegetables and fruits are the most important

2729
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Teacher, I beg

2730
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
During your research, you mentioned that it was

2731
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
body mass and muscle mass

2732
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:14,000
The amount of brittle falls in old age of boys is much more serious than that of girls

2733
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
yes

2734
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
What is the mechanism that causes men to have this situation?

2735
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
OK

2736
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
we all know men

2737
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
That is to say, his aging process is actually

2738
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:32,000
The aging process that has been going on since growing up is in progress

2739
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
What about women?

2740
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Generally speaking, it is women because of the protective effect of female hormones

2741
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
So before a woman's menopause

2742
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Basically, various chronic disease indicators are in a very good state

2743
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Women don't see this chronic disease take off until after menopause

2744
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
So women can be said to be later than men

2745
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
It can be said that it has been like this for decades

2746
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
So when we look at various indicators, we can see such a phenomenon

2747
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
For example, female obesity

2748
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,160
Women's gut ratings all take off after the age of fifty

2749
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:06,400
Then later rushed to be taller than boys

2750
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:11,000
Men have rushed to a peak after the age of seventy and all come down

2751
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,120
But that's down because of aging, not because of getting better

2752
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:17,000
So basically it's a female hormone protection

2753
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
should be the biggest reason

2754
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Hello, Teacher Pan, your main thing is nutrition, right?

2755
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Then let me ask you about a nutritional therapy and nutritional repair in the future.

2756
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:39,000
What is the progress in China and what breakthroughs have been made?

2757
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Your problem is very, very big

2758
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,000
feel a little bit about breakthrough we can

2759
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Maybe we can chat a bit later

2760
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Because nutrition is really, really complicated

2761
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
There are many other aspects. What I am talking about today is the positive aspects of old age.

2762
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
so i'm having a hard time answering

2763
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
because of baby nutrition

2764
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
nutrition for pregnant women

2765
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Have nutrition for the elderly

2766
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Chronic Disease Nutrition

2767
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Disease prevention and treatment with cancer

2768
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
and disease treatment

2769
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
many facets

2770
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
so i can't answer right now

2771
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
do you have any specific questions

2772
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Teacher Pan

2773
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
You seem to be on the heart side

2774
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
full of a heart weary even

2775
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
no large system

2776
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
A repair and therapy for noodles

2777
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
most importantly

2778
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Presentation of one of its research results

2779
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
If you come to the country where you are from now

2780
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
what better way

2781
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
for example

2782
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
like my heart

2783
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
There is a problem caused by

2784
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
A functional underground of the pretend line

2785
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
The function of the pretend line is underground

2786
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I am nourishing myself

2787
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Absorptive capacity

2788
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
a factor of the missing part

2789
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Does it affect the heart?

2790
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
even affect the kidneys

2791
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Yes or no

2792
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
nutritional therapy

2793
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Current Domestic Research

2794
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
is there any progress

2795
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
i don't know

2796
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
terribly sorry

2797
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
because

2798
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
assume this

2799
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
that pseudogland

2800
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,000
because we generally

2801
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
adenopathy in the largest

2802
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
it involves

2803
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
canned bean disease

2804
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Then you just

2805
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
is the so-called

2806
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:21,000
called secondary

2807
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
that is because

2808
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
caused by other diseases

2809
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
It actually has a lot to do with nutrition

2810
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Relatively far

2811
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
because I do nutrition

2812
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
close like a can

2813
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
that arterial

2814
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
this heart disease

2815
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
is the largest

2816
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
it involves

2817
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
diet

2818
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Fat

2819
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Metabolic abnormalities

2820
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,000
with diabetes

2821
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
this metabolic abnormality

2822
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
The main thing is this

2823
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
cause me in this

2824
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,000
But the one you just said

2825
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
not my research scope

2826
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
sorry sorry

2827
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,000
see if there is anything else

2828
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,000
other questions

2829
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
and you just mentioned that

2830
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
when boys

2831
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
when the whole recession

2832
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
waning from the start

2833
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
but i used to

2834
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,000
The information given to us is that the girl is after menopause

2835
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:12,000
The speed of the entire recession will grow very fast

2836
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
But just now when the teacher made this information

2837
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
When the girl was at the time of the decaying speed

2838
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Much slower than boys

2839
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
What direction is this looking at?

2840
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
One of the worst things women do have is osteoporosis

2841
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Women lose bone very quickly after menopause

2842
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
She is indeed presenting an immediate drop

2843
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
This is one of the most serious problems for women

2844
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,000
men won't

2845
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
males are slowly declining

2846
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
But what I just talked about is the other aspects

2847
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
especially metabolic like diabetes

2848
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
like a heart attack

2849
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
like high blood pressure

2850
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,000
This piece of women starts after menopause

2851
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
deterioration

2852
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,000
But a woman is actually saying that she has a long time ahead

2853
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,600
It doesn't matter if the protection period starts at the beginning

2854
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,800
It is very important for women to stop menstruation

2855
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,200
Make drastic lifestyle adjustments now

2856
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:10,300
It will be pressed back

2857
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,800
So it's fine for women too

2858
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:14,200
It's because you suddenly discovered how my body changed

2859
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:17,000
If something is wrong, change immediately

2860
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,100
If you want a big change, you can suppress it

2861
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:22,700
So yes lifestyle therapy has its uses

2862
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:28,100
Excuse me, teacher, you just kept emphasizing

2863
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:31,200
All Protein Milk Eggs

2864
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,500
But when we eat protein

2865
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:37,000
acid in the stomach

2866
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,400
PH3 is all denatured

2867
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:42,500
Can it be used by our body again?

2868
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,200
Transgender broke or what?

2869
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,200
is not like this

2870
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,800
It is actually a process of digestion

2871
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:50,300
What we eat is protein

2872
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:52,960
Proteins are many amino acids

2873
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,400
formed long sword

2874
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:57,300
So the long acid digestion in the stomach

2875
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:58,000
is very important

2876
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,900
because in that situation

2877
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
break down some proteins

2878
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
will put this long chain

2879
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
The so-called ecology cut it off

2880
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
cut into tiny amino acids

2881
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
we can absorb

2882
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Without this action

2883
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
In fact, those proteins can't be absorbed

2884
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
so it's not like you might think

2885
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Say it breaks, it ain't breaks

2886
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
its destruction is called

2887
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
should be called decomposition

2888
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
break down from large molecules to small molecules

2889
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
So we can take advantage of the absorbed

2890
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
recombine in our body

2891
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Become an ecological long chain

2892
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
in the necessary position

2893
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
emerge with the necessary structure

2894
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
that transgender is not

2895
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
like that us

2896
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
eggs to fry

2897
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
become hard

2898
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
that is transgender

2899
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
the same with stomach acid

2900
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
also transgender

2901
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
that ruined the whole

2902
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
no no no

2903
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
That's what it means to change sex

2904
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
That is, it is in an animal or plant body

2905
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
form of existence

2906
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Then after you pass through the Lord

2907
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,000
already transsexual

2908
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
For example, protein white is liquid

2909
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,500
Mainly will become solid

2910
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:08,500
The three-dimensional space of its structure changes

2911
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,500
The three-dimensional space has changed

2912
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:13,500
Then after you enter this body

2913
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,000
No matter how it is three-dimensional space

2914
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
i cut it off

2915
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,500
It's the protein breaker cup

2916
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,000
cut it all off

2917
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,500
Cut it all into one tiny unit

2918
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:24,000
So whether transgender or not

2919
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,500
just eat your eggs

2920
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,000
Or eat your already solid egg

2921
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
It looks the same until it is decomposed

2922
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
They are all small one by one

2923
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
just one by one

2924
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Then the inside grows long enough to absorb it

2925
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
and its body is back where it should be

2926
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
like muscles

2927
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Or do the necessary synthesis of each part

2928
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
so not a problem

2929
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
that lady

2930
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
to the back

2931
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Okay, then there is another classmate behind you

2932
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Miss

2933
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Hello Dr. Ann

2934
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I have seen it said here

2935
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,340
Has published more than 300 academic papers

2936
01:56:04,340 --> 01:56:12,820
Among them, you are focusing on the diet and genetic inheritance of metabolic diseases in the elderly

2937
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:14,140
here factor

2938
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,220
Where can we see your paper

2939
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:23,660
All of our papers are written in English

2940
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:25,100
Internationally

2941
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,420
so

2942
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:28,620
what kind of journal

2943
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:29,700
various periodicals

2944
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:33,700
So I don't know about your little show We have a place in academia called

2945
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:38,580
P-POP-MAD P-U-B-M-E-D

2946
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:39,260
this

2947
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:42,060
You type P-U-B-M-E-D in Google

2948
01:56:42,060 --> 01:56:43,100
you will go in

2949
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:45,380
Then you call Pan Wenhan

2950
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:46,780
My English name

2951
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:49,860
my english name may be

2952
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:50,580
W-E-N

2953
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:51,900
you just call my name

2954
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,100
W-E-N

2955
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:56,860
You can if you can type my name in Chinese on Google

2956
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:58,900
you can see my english name

2957
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:00,100
you type my name in

2958
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
All my papers will come out

2959
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
that he

2960
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:04,000
But I'm afraid you don't understand

2961
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
it's all in english

2962
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
right

2963
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I want to focus on what is the special topic of this article

2964
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
his

2965
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
For example, there is a

2966
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
You said it was today, right?

2967
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
no

2968
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
that is

2969
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
In more than 300 articles, he

2970
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Emphasis on this article

2971
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
OK

2972
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
This doesn't seem to be the focus

2973
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
He said it was this series, this series

2974
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
this series

2975
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
right

2976
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
this kind

2977
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:30,000
theme

2978
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
right

2979
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
There are various papers

2980
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Thanks

2981
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I think

2982
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Take his question and ask it by the way

2983
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Now the question you just focused on is

2984
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Nutrition for Cardiovascular Metabolism

2985
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
then ask

2986
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Where is the hottest direction right now

2987
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Cardiovascular

2988
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,000
his

2989
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
for example

2990
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
people with coronary artery disease

2991
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
in terms of diet

2992
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,600
what is the latest theory

2993
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:05,440
because it is not said recently

2994
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:10,080
Sometimes Cholesterol Is Not All That Causes

2995
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:13,440
Causes of hardening of the arteries of the heart

2996
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:15,240
The latest theory

2997
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:16,880
In fact, there are many

2998
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,000
Let me put it this way, I know you may be quite interested in cholesterol.

2999
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,440
high blood cholesterol

3000
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,200
it cures heart disease

3001
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:31,120
And that's basically narrowing this canister artery.

3002
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:34,680
That theory has not been disproved until now.

3003
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:36,320
still exist

3004
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,640
Now the latest controversy is that

3005
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:41,840
can you eat eggs

3006
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,480
high blood cholesterol

3007
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:45,920
It will definitely cure cardiovascular disease

3008
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,280
Increased risk of cardiovascular disease

3009
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:49,560
it's ok

3010
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,520
The problem is that eating eggs

3011
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,320
Will it increase blood cholesterol

3012
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:56,720
yes the problem is here

3013
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:59,440
What about this

3014
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,680
A correct statement is that it should be

3015
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:06,800
That is to say, the cholesterol content of the egg itself

3016
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,640
Affects the blood to a moderate extent

3017
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:10,960
the degree is not high

3018
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:13,600
The most important factor affecting blood cholesterol

3019
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,200
is saturated fatty acid

3020
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,960
that is, the butter

3021
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:19,280
For example, eating butter

3022
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,760
And red meat, pork fat

3023
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,720
There is CTS oil, coconut oil

3024
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:27,720
These oils and the backlash just mentioned

3025
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:30,680
These are the ones that cause the blood to be high

3026
01:59:30,680 --> 01:59:34,560
So why did you talk about eggs before and don't talk about eggs now?

3027
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,400
It's just that the diet of human beings in the past is a little different from what it is now

3028
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,080
in the previous time and space

3029
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:44,320
This egg has a greater impact

3030
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,320
Now the time-space egg has less influence

3031
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:49,120
So the same research is repeated and redone

3032
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:51,760
Now slowly find that the impact of eggs is getting smaller

3033
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:52,880
so it will follow

3034
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:54,680
plus Americans

3035
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:56,520
Because this suggestion is from the United States

3036
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:59,560
Cholesterol drops across the U.S.

3037
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,320
Since the United States of America has changed the recommendation to say

3038
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:05,000
Eating eggs is not that serious

3039
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,400
The most important thing is to protect the fat

3040
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:07,920
still say so

3041
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:10,240
But this is for ordinary people

3042
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:14,080
If you are a person with already high cholesterol in Cholesterolology

3043
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:18,160
However, it is still necessary to minimize

3044
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:19,600
or should you say

3045
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:21,360
if you find you eat eggs

3046
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,520
you can test yourself

3047
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:23,800
just go up

3048
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:25,000
should be reduced

3049
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:25,840
do you understand

3050
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:27,640
it points to common people's advice

3051
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,960
It is still different from the patient's suggestion

3052
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:32,280
so i don't know what else

3053
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:33,560
other salary

3054
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,560
Because everyone does a lot of different research

3055
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:38,760
For example, what I am currently doing

3056
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,640
There are two relatively new

3057
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:43,360
I'm talking about a mineral

3058
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,960
minerals are beautiful

3059
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:48,960
The protective effect of this beauty on heart diseases

3060
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:49,680
I'm currently discussing

3061
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:51,360
Actually I have published a

3062
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:54,440
Journal of the American Academy of Clinical Nutrition

3063
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:55,560
I help this patient

3064
02:00:55,560 --> 02:00:57,320
patients who have already had a stroke

3065
02:00:57,320 --> 02:00:59,720
I scan his beauty every day

3066
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000
A month later his stroke recovery was better than no one

3067
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
is twice as good

3068
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
It has been published here

3069
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Well, I actually found that this beauty may affect blood flow

3070
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
So I'm doing a study recently which is

3071
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
head and beauty

3072
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
See if it affects the blood flow rate

3073
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,000
that affects this

3074
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
If it affects the blood flow velocity from the neck to the brain

3075
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
We now have to go further

3076
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Will it affect dementia

3077
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
For example, this is my current

3078
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
a new study being done

3079
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
But I dare not tell you now

3080
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I'm not done yet

3081
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Another research we are doing is

3082
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
After making oil to fry it

3083
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
fried food

3084
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Will it affect a variety of different diseases

3085
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Then we found that

3086
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
May be some fried it's ok

3087
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
some fried

3088
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
So if this result comes out in the future

3089
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
i will

3090
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,000
just maybe for example

3091
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
How do you tell the public when you hold a press conference?

3092
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
OK if you want fried food

3093
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
you must use this oil for frying

3094
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
But fried food no matter what

3095
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
just good fried

3096
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,560
There will also be some problems, so I will explain them clearly to you.

3097
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:05,560
Which oil can be fried and which oil can not be fried

3098
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:08,560
Then it’s best to fry as much as you can eat in a week

3099
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:10,760
That's another research I'm doing

3100
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:15,640
That of course means that if it is fried for too long

3101
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:19,000
This means that qualitative variability is another possible problem

3102
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:19,440
right

3103
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,840
We just had a problem here

3104
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:23,320
there is a question

3105
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:24,120
there is a classmate

3106
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:24,600
right

3107
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,600
I want to ask Teacher Pan about that

3108
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:30,840
Why do some elderly people's feet are particularly prone to cramp

3109
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,840
Does it have anything to do with diet?

3110
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,400
The problem of cramping is also

3111
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:38,800
In fact, sometimes a symptom

3112
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,160
Actually very

3113
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,160
It should be said that non-specific is

3114
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,920
Usually we are talking about causal inference

3115
02:02:44,920 --> 02:02:47,480
means that A will cause B

3116
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:51,680
But is B just because of A

3117
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:53,560
it's hard to say

3118
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:55,160
Your question now is a little bit

3119
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,320
For example, it's not the same as virology.

3120
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,880
Hepatitis B Virus

3121
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
can cause hepatitis B

3122
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,000
if you have hepatitis B

3123
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
You are the hepatitis B virus

3124
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
But now the cramp problem is A, B, C, D, E

3125
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
There's a whole bunch of them that can give you a cramp

3126
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
so i'm having a hard time answering

3127
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
But if we talk about the diet

3128
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
often

3129
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
caused by electrolyte imbalance

3130
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
calcium for example

3131
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
For example, beauty

3132
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
For example, A

3133
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
but i can't decide

3134
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
it should probably mean

3135
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Nutritionally related is electrolyte imbalance

3136
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Imbalance can cause cramps in the elderly

3137
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
And you see athletes running

3138
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Does the long hair cramp at the end?

3139
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
That's also an electrolyte imbalance.

3140
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Okay, we'll have this question later

3141
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Teacher Pan, I want to ask for advice

3142
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
That's what I saw mentioned in different places

3143
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,000
can't drink too much milk

3144
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Because of the hormone he contains

3145
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
can cause cancer

3146
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
And this is because the milk in the process of releasing oxygen

3147
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
given antibiotics

3148
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Another saying is that

3149
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:05,000
The order in which we eat protein foods is linked to weight control

3150
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Protein should be eaten first or after

3151
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Can affect weight control

3152
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Please help me with this question

3153
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
OK

3154
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
The first one is about the problem of not being able to eat this kind of milk

3155
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
This is indeed very popular on the Internet

3156
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
We often even I often receive emails to see such problems

3157
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
From the standpoint of our nutritionists

3158
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,000
We think it's a stigma against milk

3159
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
it's a pity

3160
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
a very good food

3161
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
The result is stigmatized like this

3162
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I don't understand where these things come from

3163
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
But I can also imagine

3164
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Why do ordinary people easily accept such a concept

3165
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,000
just because milk has a problem

3166
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
so-called lactose intolerance

3167
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
If you are lactose intolerant

3168
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
words in the short term

3169
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
You do have some lactose in the upgrade

3170
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Lactose cannot be metabolized in the body

3171
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
may cause some

3172
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,600
a symptom of diarrhea

3173
02:05:01,600 --> 02:05:04,440
even some bad microbes

3174
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,200
growth of intestinal flora

3175
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:07,240
make you uncomfortable

3176
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,440
like flatulence or something

3177
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:10,880
will definitely have this problem

3178
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,600
so when you eat it you don't feel well

3179
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:15,600
Then when paired with these rumors on the Internet

3180
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:16,880
you'll feel it's right

3181
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,000
So cause this phenomenon

3182
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
But if we look at big data

3183
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,320
For example, if you look at big data

3184
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,720
We still have a lot of data like nutritional surveys

3185
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:28,280
Let's analyze domestic people who drink milk

3186
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:30,800
His health is better

3187
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:32,280
And he's a protein

3188
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,480
if there is a milk drinker

3189
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:36,080
he is usually less fat

3190
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:38,280
He is less prone to some metabolic syndrome

3191
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:40,600
So he actually if you analyze the data

3192
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,040
he's all right

3193
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:44,680
But ordinary people experience

3194
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:46,880
Seeing this makes me feel uncomfortable

3195
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,480
So his problem is because of lactose intolerance

3196
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:53,240
Then lactose intolerance can be overcome

3197
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:54,760
His method of overcoming is

3198
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:55,880
you start with a small amount

3199
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:58,120
like me personally for a while

3200
02:05:58,120 --> 02:06:00,120
just not busy

3201
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,640
We are too busy to pay attention to this matter

3202
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:03,600
So then I can't drink milk

3203
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:05,720
So then I because I'm a nutritionist myself

3204
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:07,880
I said I made it look like this

3205
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:12,120
So I started cultivating my own lactose-digesting enzymes

3206
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:13,040
how to do that

3207
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:16,760
That is to say, today you make a cup of tea, for example

3208
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:17,720
I will let it go today

3209
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:19,120
I like to use milk powder

3210
02:06:19,120 --> 02:06:20,560
because it is more convenient

3211
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,240
Just put a soup and a pool of powdered tea milk powder

3212
02:06:24,240 --> 02:06:26,040
You'll be fine if you drink it

3213
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:28,680
Then two o'clock the next day

3214
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:30,440
drink like this for a week

3215
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:31,600
i can take two hours

3216
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:33,400
next week at three o'clock

3217
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:34,760
then four o'clock

3218
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:35,440
no problem

3219
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,080
Just one time to cultivate it like this

3220
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,240
you can drink later

3221
02:06:40,240 --> 02:06:41,680
This is such a point of view

3222
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:44,520
So our nutritionists' dietary guidelines in Taiwan

3223
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:46,840
We recommend a day alone

3224
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:47,760
one to two cups

3225
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,360
that's one and a half cups

3226
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,360
but i have to tell you

3227
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:53,600
That's what I'm working on recently

3228
02:06:53,600 --> 02:06:56,320
that is climate change

3229
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:58,760
Then let's read the latest article I recently read

3230
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:00,160
started to talk about an issue

3231
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:03,160
This is an idea of ​​sacrificing the small self for the sake of the big self

3232
02:07:03,160 --> 02:07:07,200
That is to say, if there is not enough food in the world in the future,

3233
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,940
What kind of food shall we eat

3234
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:11,720
it maintains health

3235
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:14,320
And then to ensure global food security

3236
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:15,720
everyone has food

3237
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:17,660
that such a food

3238
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:19,780
Just be less animalistic

3239
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:21,180
less animal

3240
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:22,860
But it's not about eating bad food

3241
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:24,600
Then when I was reading these papers

3242
02:07:24,600 --> 02:07:27,160
Discover their recommendations intermediate for milk

3243
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:29,860
Do you want to see how good cheese Westerners eat?

3244
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:32,860
Pizza Burger Milk Coffee

3245
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:34,060
Good milk is there

3246
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,560
but they say

3247
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:37,600
in the future they will wish to say

3248
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:41,060
That's the amount of a glass of milk a day

3249
02:07:41,060 --> 02:07:41,500
just fine

3250
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:43,800
This is for environmental protection

3251
02:07:43,800 --> 02:07:45,760
When considering this climate change

3252
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,300
Let me tell you about this latest trend

3253
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:51,500
Is that glass of milk good for health?

3254
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:52,260
It must be possible

3255
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:53,800
because you are in that situation

3256
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:55,660
you will go with other food

3257
02:07:55,660 --> 02:07:58,900
Can soy milk replace milk

3258
02:07:58,900 --> 02:07:59,940
soy milk

3259
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,480
In our current dietary guidelines

3260
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,560
If you follow the current dietary guidelines when eating

3261
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:05,560
it won't work

3262
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:08,960
Because we plan it as your calcium

3263
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,360
And your B complex and some minerals

3264
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:13,360
Like armor and beauty are derived from milk

3265
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:15,000
Then soybeans

3266
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,040
Definitely delivers the same amount of protein

3267
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:19,840
But the calcium in soybeans

3268
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:23,080
Much less than these B groups

3269
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:25,280
So in the future if we want to do this

3270
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:26,800
So we often learn as we do

3271
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,280
One more topic to talk about is

3272
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:31,920
with added soymilk

3273
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,520
It's this soy milk that adds some

3274
02:08:34,520 --> 02:08:36,760
Even food rich in group B is fine.

3275
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:39,720
Or add vitamin calcium and D

3276
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:41,280
This can be considered in the future

3277
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:44,360
It's just that we have had some conversations with manufacturers

3278
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:47,000
The food world they have so far had no will

3279
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,080
launch this thing

3280
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:50,520
So in the future we will see what kind of method to use

3281
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,720
Encourage the so-called matching with milk

3282
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:58,120
It is soy milk with exactly the same nutritional value

3283
02:08:58,120 --> 02:09:00,080
Our countrymen also like to drink

3284
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:04,000
So I think this is a direction we will work hard in the future.

3285
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
ok i think it's about time

3286
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
So let me give you a preview of the next self-thought feast

3287
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:15,000
It was the lecture given by President Zhu Jiahua Ke Puye on May 28

3288
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Wang Baoguan Banquet Room, the Center of Environmental Change

3289
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
He used to be the director of the center

3290
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:26,000
The secret of the coming and going storm in the long wind

3291
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Everyone is welcome to sign up

3292
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Thanks again Professor Pan Honghuan

3293
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:19,440
Thank you.
