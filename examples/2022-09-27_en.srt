Innovative Drug Design Award

72
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Because besides being a Central Academician

73
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,720
He is also a member of the Academy of Sciences in the world

74
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Academic achievement is truly remarkable

75
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,720
I admire it very much

76
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Academician Niu Fang Ph.D.

77
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,320
especially in biomedical

78
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,840
is a very in-depth study

79
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,720
see discussion

80
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,800
and there are some very unique

81
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,320
some insights

82
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,120
especially in today's award

83
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
From Cancer Prevention to Longevity

84
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Also his speech is very deep

85
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
and is very rich

86
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
also a reason

87
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
In the past we asked whether to use video to help

88
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Come to this lecture given by the former Dean Gu

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I think we still have to be there

90
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Be able to

91
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's just that he will be more

92
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That is, everyone will feel more

93
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Before Academician Liu started his speech

94
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's invite the son of former Dean Gu first

95
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He is Chiang Ching-kuo International Academic Exchange

96
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
chairman of the foundation

97
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Former Mr. Vice gave us a speech

98
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then invite National Taiwan University

99
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Luo Qinghua, Vice President of National Taiwan University

100
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
say a few words for us

101
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, first of all, thank you both for your speeches.

102
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Then look forward to Academician Liu's speech

103
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
ok thank you everyone

104
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Thanks

105
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Today's speaker, visiting academicians, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good night, everyone

106
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I am very grateful to Academia Sinica for holding a popular science lecture in memory of my late father here today.

107
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If my late father is reborn this year, he will be 114 years old, he must be very accurate

108
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And it's been 39 years since he died

109
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I am very grateful that Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University took turns to host Academia Sinica in the odd-numbered years of the Republic of China.

110
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
In the even-numbered years of the Republic of China, National Taiwan University hosted

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Because my father misses chemistry

112
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
He has been studying chemistry all his life

113
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,800
So two schools and colleges

114
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Commemorative lectures are given in a popular science way

115
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,000
And this year it's a pity

116
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Thoughts due to coronavirus

117
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,600
It should be held in February

118
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
There is no way to study until today

119
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
but can hold

120
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,600
we are very happy

121
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
especially in this place

122
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,600
This biomedical institute is a former academician founded by my second brother

123
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
So I came near this place

124
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,600
kind of feel like home

125
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
tonight we

126
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,600
The speaker, Mr. Liu Fang, has just been introduced in detail by Vice President Liu.

127
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,060
I don't have many

128
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,860
I am very grateful to him for taking time out of his busy schedule to speak for us.

129
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,140
From cancer to longevity

130
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:23,500
I believe it is of great significance to everyone

131
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,900
Thank you for coming

132
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,600
once again on behalf of my family

133
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,000
Thanks Academician Liu

134
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Thank you for coming

135
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,700
Thanks

136
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Thank you for coming

137
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Academician Liu, our keynote speaker today, is very honored to represent National Taiwan University to participate in this holy meeting

138
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Everyone, Vice President Liu also mentioned to you just now that our former president served as the president of Academia Sinica for 13 years

139
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We all know that many people at National Taiwan University talk about the principal and the deputy director.

140
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
In fact, the longest-serving principal in our National Taiwan University campus is the former director and former principal.

141
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I personally didn't have a chance. I was born a few years later, otherwise my graduation certificate would be the same as the two Academicians Liu.

142
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The graduation certificate can be the signature of the former principal

143
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But today there are very, very many congregations in this congregation

144
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So we come to this holy congregation today

145
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The graduation certificate can be the signature of the former principal

146
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But today's holy meeting is very, very, a coincidence, and a very difficult thing

147
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Both the speaker and the moderator are graduates from the Department of Chemistry

148
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,440
We know the ex-principal has practiced

149
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
Head of Department of Cultural Studies

150
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,440
Dean Li Xuan

151
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,720
to the provost

152
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,680
to the principal

153
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
He from 1950 to 1970

154
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,080
But the president of National Taiwan University for nearly 20 years

155
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
That National Taiwan University has today

156
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,400
Except for the deputy mayor and principal

157
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,840
this sentence

158
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,320
this is like this

159
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,480
The snow wind that maintained the freedom of our National Taiwan University

160
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,280
In fact, many internal organizations of National Taiwan University

161
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,480
charter

162
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,160
rule

163
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,160
or all aspects

164
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,280
Even after thinking of many ways today

165
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,000
In fact, they were all under the tenure of our former principal.

166
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,120
Laid down

167
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,280
So NTU actually has today

168
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,720
Gui Gongyi is really

169
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
In terms of school administration

170
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,120
I think boudoir

171
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,760
There are very, very many of the principal

172
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm right

173
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,320
Although the former principal

174
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,560
personal friend

175
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,000
My graduation certificate does not have the signature of the former principal

176
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,800
but i'm very honored

177
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,840
I admire him very much

178
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,080
I remember 18 years ago when I was

179
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Walk into the office of the Faculty of Science as soon as you become the dean of the Faculty of Science

180
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,560
First

181
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,100
Stepping into the commissioned actor is

182
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,560
ex-mayor principal's

183
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,560
The desk used by the dean of the Faculty of Science

184
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,900
There's still a pen he used in the top drawer.

185
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,940
and his briefcase

186
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,040
So that internal class impressed me very much

187
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,900
Even today I am still serving as the chairman of the school's school education product association.

188
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,760
I often encounter some teachers who comment on things

189
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,500
I always think that our method at that time was determined by the former principal.

190
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,760
So that's something we're very grateful for

191
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,960
I just saw a few people in that drawer

192
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,260
Our teachers from National Taiwan University were also present

193
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
I miss our teachers and students at National Taiwan University

194
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,660
In addition to this personal appreciation

195
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,060
There are many teachers and students in Taiwan on campus

196
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,960
Buildings to our latest largest lecture hall

197
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,300
We also live in vain

198
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,040
So you can imagine

199
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,940
former principal to us

200
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How helpful is National Taiwan University?

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,500
I just mentioned today that I am very honored

202
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,000
A few of us seem to have gained less from the former principal

203
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So I didn't graduate from the Department of Chemistry

204
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The two protagonists and the daily hosts are graduates of the Department of Chemistry

205
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Then I happened to talk to the ex-principal

206
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
once supplied an office

207
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
very honored for you

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The former dean Chen Du just told us

209
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica undertake this event every other year

210
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The Memorial Symposium The Memorial Lecture

211
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But today I would like to thank our brigade vice president for arranging

212
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
this speech today

213
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Because tomorrow is Teacher's Day

214
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
more significant

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Especially now that Shi Dao meets and demonstrates today

216
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There was such a wonderful speech on the eve of the teacher circle

217
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
very very rare

218
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
i want to thank our protagonist

219
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,500
Thank you for listening, everyone. Thank you.

220
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,400
Because there are so many distinguished guests here today

221
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Let's celebrate together so please

222
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Ladies and gentlemen, you can come to the stage

223
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,300
Let's take a group photo thank you

224
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Thanks

225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's all you're saying.

226
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Okay.

227
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:15,000
OK I would like to thank this former vice chairman Luo Vice President Liu Vice President Dong

228
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
When the vice president called me, he asked me to give a talk

229
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think it’s very good, so I said I’m talking about the DNA control and the anti-cancer mechanism.

230
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Later, I talked with my wife and I said that I would like to talk about the right to control DNA.

231
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I said that I have been doing Cao Luoquan all my life and now I finally find out how powerful Cao Luoquan is.

232
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Then my wife said that if you talk about mobilizing power, you can talk to the air

233
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So I thought about it and changed the title.

234
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Changed to DNA prevention to longevity

235
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This topic is very very broad

236
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
OK now the mechanism is very very very hard to understand

237
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,040
It cooperates to talk about its common mechanism

238
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
not a simple matter

239
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
There is an avatar here

240
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
half body avatar

241
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:18,040
This is at the school gate of Beiyi University

242
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,040
It's just that we haven't reached the guard's place yet.

243
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
have this avatar

244
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
This is Hiphocates

245
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,040
2400 BC

246
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,080
it is known as the father of medicine

247
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
because it turns medicine into that discipline

248
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
so i guess it's well deserved

249
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
the owner

250
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
it said a word

251
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
i think

252
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
I don't quite understand this sentence

253
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
i'll take it out

254
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,080
So that food be your medicine

255
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,080
And medicine be your food

256
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,080
food as medicine

257
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
i think everyone agrees

258
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
There's a lot in food that can

259
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,120
food as medicine

260
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It says medicine be your food

261
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't know what this means

262
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
exactly

263
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that is literally

264
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
just to be food

265
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So it turns out that you only take medicine

266
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't eat food you don't want

267
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
If this explanation

268
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
is that really someone

269
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
make it happen

270
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
what will happen then

271
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I will finally tell you

272
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Someone really ate it for 40 years

273
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
herbal medicine

274
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Except for a little rice wine

275
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
no other ordinary food

276
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
ok

277
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
let me talk about this first

278
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
cancer prevention

279
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Let's talk about this longevity again

280
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The common mechanism in the middle

281
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I will speak at the end

282
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that next slide

283
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm sorry I'll do it myself

284
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Thanks

285
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,300
Because I'm thinking that I'm from chemistry

286
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,100
Life is the chemistry of DNA supercoiling

287
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,700
Its thermodynamic free energy

288
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,600
The relationship between its superhelix and double helix

289
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,300
Relationship with other DNA structures

290
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,800
Is to do these things to transform with Top

291
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,200
with their role

292
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,900
Speaking of this topic

293
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Even cancer prevention is an occasional thing

294
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
I'll tell you the story later

295
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,800
Why do cancer prevention

296
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,200
I am the first to talk about cancer prevention

297
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,000
It's part 1 about cancer prevention

298
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,300
The anti-cancer is that many things can prevent cancer

299
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,600
you took a rough look

300
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Everyone knows this

301
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,100
Many so-called healthy foods contain

302
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,800
all from here

303
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
can be roughly divided into three categories

304
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,300
One is like polyphenol

305
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,600
It is a multi-point compound

306
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,320
I will give an example is the red wine tree

307
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,720
it is longevity

308
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,000
The other one is this class

309
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
There is a functional group

310
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
is isothyl saminate

311
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
or elucid

312
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,520
This is the isothylsaminate group

313
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,600
The component of this group can hinder

314
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
OK

315
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,400
Of course a lot can get in the way

316
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,400
It's just that this story is relatively complete

317
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,800
and was probably the first

318
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,000
OK

319
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,800
Then I will also talk about antioxidant water

320
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,600
Because apart from these Diat

321
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,000
It's vegetables

322
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,800
In fact, water also has many tricks

323
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Then I also learned it in Beijing Medical University.

324
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,300
This antioxidant water

325
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,000
OK

326
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,900
In fact, this audience has Professor Liu Yichuan

327
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,600
He is making golden water

328
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,300
It is very strong in anti-oxidation

329
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,800
OK

330
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,400
I'll give you a general overview later.

331
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
OK

332
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,000
next

333
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,600
OK

334
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
OK

335
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,600
OK

336
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,600
This one wasn't here

337
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,400
is behind

338
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,000
OK

339
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
Let me briefly mention

340
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,800
what's the matter with this water

341
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,600
OK

342
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
Because everyone is in the market

343
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,800
everyone knows what it's called

344
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,600
Toshimizu

345
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,400
Futura water

346
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,000
Reduced water

347
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
And of course gold leaf wine

348
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,800
Or Gold Activated Water

349
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
a lot

350
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
actually belong to

351
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
The so-called Hydrogen Medicine

352
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
or Hydrogen Therapy

353
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,400
it has many functions

354
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,600
In fact, some of what I just said

355
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
The role of the component in Diablet

356
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,200
actually the same

357
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,600
It works on the same mechanism

358
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,200
It is induce this

359
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,600
this enzyme

360
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Nurve 2

361
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:44,800
OK

362
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,400
I'll tell you all about it later

363
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,600
How important is this enzyme

364
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,200
OK

365
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Then I'll probably just mention

366
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,800
What the hell is going on with electrolyzed water?

367
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,800
The resulting cathode water is used to

368
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,400
OK

369
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Cathode water for health

370
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
What about the anode? Now I found out

371
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,040
while watching tv

372
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,320
The TV said that there is something called water god now

373
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,600
In fact, it has anode water

374
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,100
OK

375
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,960
that is

376
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,460
Well

377
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,840
Is the water that appears at the anode is oxygen?

378
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,760
that Yin

379
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,760
The cathode water is what appears

380
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,760
is hydrogen

381
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,320
So it is Hydrogen medicine

382
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,960
that this

383
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,360
Well

384
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,480
wait a minute to tell everyone carefully

385
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,760
That is to say, the other one is the so-called this

386
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
uh golden water

387
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,800
OK

388
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
That golden water is more interesting

389
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,340
that is

390
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,160
and also compare

391
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,720
Well

392
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,200
powerful

393
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,020
OK

394
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
Then there is gold leaf

395
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,480
Um

396
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,800
Gold leaf is also when you put this gold leaf in the wine

397
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,760
Well

398
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,720
with visible light

399
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,280
Because it uses Clear glass

400
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,200
go in

401
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,560
then it will

402
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,480
Release the electronics on that gold

403
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,200
Just cause the cathode water to be the same

404
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,680
wait a minute to tell everyone

405
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,320
Then there are many other things you know go deep in the mountains

406
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,160
There is this waterfall

407
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,600
or water

408
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,160
Xiaoxi, what are these?

409
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,000
it both produces this

410
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
the same reaction

411
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's the collision between water and rock

412
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
or the collision of sand on the beach

413
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
The result is that electrons go from the rock to the water

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
so it's exactly the same

415
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It is the same reaction when electrons enter water

416
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
It produces the same effect

417
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Both are nerve 2

418
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
OK

419
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
so or in summer

420
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
This thunder will thunder

421
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's the same when it rains

422
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's when you're cold that hot air rises

423
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
when it starts to freeze

424
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
That's when the ice and water were mixed together for a while

425
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
ice will float up

426
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
that water is heavier

427
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
so it rubs

428
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
so-called electric shock

429
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
ice cloud

430
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The water cloud below is negatively charged

431
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
it's a one time thing

432
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it's all the same thing

433
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
in fact

434
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
The resulting effect is from nerve 2

435
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Induce out

436
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Wait a minute and explain to everyone

437
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
OK

438
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I will summarize first

439
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I'm afraid I'm talking too messy

440
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
everyone may

441
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
don't know

442
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'll talk about the conclusion first

443
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That is to say what is the common mechanism I see

444
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
OK

445
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it's actually really easy

446
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
its common mechanism

447
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
ROS is active oxygen

448
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
that active oxygen

449
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
when you eat

450
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
what we just said

451
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
When diatere component

452
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Like ITC Respiratory

453
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
it will

454
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
activate is very important

455
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
protein transcription factor

456
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
NERV2

457
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
this is very very important

458
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It can integrate a lot of signal

459
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It concretes about 500+ GINs

460
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
More than 200 of them are

461
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The so-called anti-oxidant

462
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
the enzyme

463
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Some GIN with sidal protective

464
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I will speak carefully

465
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,760
What is the control and the induction of antiaxon enzyme?

466
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,400
ok

467
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,200
The most interesting of them all is this

468
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
The problem with meteocondria

469
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,000
this

470
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,400
antiaxon control ROS is very simple

471
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
But inside involve

472
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,000
How is this ROS produced?

473
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,600
It arises from meteocondria

474
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Then your Nerve 2 will also control mitochondria

475
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,400
put it on the bad meteocondria

476
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
degrade it

477
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,800
ok expand it

478
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,200
So it is control mitochondrial quality

479
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,400
it will also control

480
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,400
indirectly

481
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,800
In fact, just control its upstream

482
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
ok is more important this step

483
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,800
ok

484
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,300
Then this result will affect cancer and aging

485
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,800
inside the meteocondria

486
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,400
It affects aging

487
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,200
What affects the nuclear is the cancer

488
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,400
All cellular DNA damage caused by ROS

489
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Or DNA mutation caused by cellular damage

490
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,800
ok

491
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,800
ok

492
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,300
Now let's talk about the details

493
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,000
Talk about how cancer prevention prevents cancer

494
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Why Cancer Prevention Is Important

495
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,500
50% chance everyone will get cancer

496
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,000
That's 1 in 2

497
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,500
1 in 5 will die of cancer

498
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,000
So cancer prevention is very important

499
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because everyone has 50% chance

500
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
to get cancer

501
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I will focus on this vegetable today

502
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
it's green cauliflower

503
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That's in the cruciferous family

504
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Can actually prevent cancer

505
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
this is more famous

506
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll talk to him later

507
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
why so famous

508
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Is cancer related to aging?

509
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
an easy way

510
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Just watch the development of this cancer

511
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Does it have anything to do with age?

512
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Everyone knows it at a glance

513
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The incidence of iSEN is proportional to age

514
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
exponential的increase

515
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Not linear, it is exponential increase

516
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
it's actually very important

517
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The older you are, the more you get the random rate of iSEN

518
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Higher, not linear, but exponential increase

519
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
What is the real mechanism that affects it

520
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Also take a closer look

521
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
iSEN is how aging-related diseases correlate

522
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
As I just said, we can see this phenomenon with age

523
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
This is another set of data, which is the cancer rate in the UK

524
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Not separated from female, it is also exponential

525
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
In addition, if you look at aging compared with it

526
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
diseases common to the elderly

527
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
is the dimension

528
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
dementia

529
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
跟cardiovascular disease

530
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
heart disease

531
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
And this curve is the same

532
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
is exponential

533
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's just that it starts counting from the age of 60

534
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This is from 0 to 4

535
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
This is from 16 to 24 years old

536
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
These curves are in front of white light

537
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
like this

538
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's white light rising again

539
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
so it looks like they are related

540
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
but isn't it

541
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
There is really a causal relationship

542
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Then this depends on its mechanism

543
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
will know

544
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
ok

545
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Let me tell you first

546
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
ok

547
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
let me start by saying

548
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
is in the US

549
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
it was before

550
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
in 1930

551
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
this stomach cancer

552
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
is almost

553
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
in these cancers

554
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
it is number one

555
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Highest incidence

556
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
but this cancer

557
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,800
Its incidence has been decreasing

558
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,200
By 2000

559
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
almost the most

560
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,600
it is the lowest

561
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
from highest to lowest

562
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,200
That's stomach cancer

563
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,600
Lung cancer, of course, has been on the rise

564
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:19,200
Why is gastric cancer declining?

565
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,000
The general view is that

566
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,600
It is similar to the fact that Americans originally liked to eat meat in the south-central

567
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,800
everything is pickled

568
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,600
It's just a lot of casino gold in these meats

569
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,600
is that with the refrigerator

570
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,200
it eats fresh meat now

571
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,200
It has something to do with this vegetarian dish

572
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,300
So it won't touch Casino Gold

573
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,500
it's just an explanation

574
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,200
Another possible explanation for it is that

575
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,800
Because Americans love to eat lettuce salad

576
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,240
very favorable

577
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,000
eat that lettuce salad

578
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Isn't it just that there is no casino gold in it?

579
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,600
It also has anti-cancer stuff in it

580
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,200
The answer is actually both

581
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,800
Eat fresh food and avoid these pickled things

582
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
cause stomach cancer

583
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
Just like Japan likes to eat pickled

584
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,200
These orientals prefer to eat

585
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,000
So gastric cancer is consistently high

586
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,600
Of course, eat fresh fruits and vegetables in the United States

587
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,200
With meat it plummets

588
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Stomach cancer has not been seen in the United States until now

589
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,800
exactly what happened

590
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
When I was in 1980

591
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,200
I went to Hopkins down assistant professor

592
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,600
At that time my neighbor was portality

593
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
He is chair of pharmacology

594
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,800
I am in the department of biochemistry

595
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Didn't talk at that time

596
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,400
At that time, the department of physiological chemistry

597
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,000
I will change the name to department of biological chemistry

598
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Our department is Lelinger, he is the chair

599
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Then he was of course the Lelinger who wrote the book on biochemistry

600
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
After I went there, his office is next door to mine

601
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So he came to me one day and asked

602
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
He said to talk to me, he asked me what I was doing

603
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Then I will tell him, I said I discovered this type 2 DNA tophilisomerase

604
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
This nzine I say is fantastic

605
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Can supercoil dna to unravel it

606
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
The two interlocked rings can also be unlocked

607
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
This topological knot can also be tied or pulled off

608
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And they are all catalytic reaction

609
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
So I say it's a very important decimal

610
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
At the same time, the fluctuation of the superhelix of DNA will also generate

611
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
is dna

612
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
DNA上的Helical Tracking Process

613
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Like things like Transcription Replication

614
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
hypersuspension of DNA

615
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The government's different overhangs are passing in the form of fluctuations

616
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
then these are

617
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I find it very interesting

618
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Where does NZAN work

619
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
After I told him this

620
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
i thought he would be impressed by me

621
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He actually said something

622
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
i'm not happy

623
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
he just said

624
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He said the work you did

625
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Probably Eventually may have something to do with medicine

626
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I'm not too happy

627
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
he means to say

628
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
What I am doing now has nothing to do with medicine

629
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Actually he was right

630
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
What I do has nothing to do with medicine

631
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
just discovered these things

632
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But we don't know what these functions are

633
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That is to say, until ten years later

634
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
roughly clear everything

635
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
OK

636
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
OK

637
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
this is the thing

638
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Make me pay more attention to Medicine

639
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
want to say look at me

640
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This Topioid Sumerix

641
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Does it have anything to do with this Medicine?

642
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
OK

643
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
ten years later

644
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I went to him

645
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
next

646
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I went to him ten years later

647
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I tell him

648
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I found our enzyme

649
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Top 2

650
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
就Type 2 Topioid Sumerix

651
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It is Anti-cancer drug

652
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Target

653
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I say this is very important

654
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I say this

655
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'll just talk to him

656
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
he just told me

657
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
He said I was in the morning

658
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I went to see him after ten o'clock

659
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
He said he is busy now

660
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I said what are you busy with?

661
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
He said my noon

662
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
To open a Press Conference

663
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
He said CNN

664
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
ABCCBS

665
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
These reporters will come

666
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
what did i say

667
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
he said

668
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,160
It found a compound of just cancer prevention

669
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,640
called isocyl cyanate

670
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,400
What is the Chinese translation called?

671
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
free-flowing cyanide

672
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:11,960
OK

673
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
That's a vegetable in the cruciferous family

674
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,120
It's in broccoli

675
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,680
OK

676
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,400
Then it says it can prevent cancer

677
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,360
It's done in the animal model

678
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
it couldn't be happier

679
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,640
tell me about it

680
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,680
OK

681
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,680
it also told me

682
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,280
it says an ounce of prevention

683
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,880
is worth a pound of cure

684
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,360
It says it was spoken by Benjamin Franklin

685
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,960
Of course it is correct

686
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,320
so it says for all human

687
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,640
major human diseases

688
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,520
before they are cured

689
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,360
they are prevented

690
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,160
it told me about it

691
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,680
i must be a little weird

692
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,760
I don't think so

693
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,520
it talks about infectious disease

694
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,600
is not wrong

695
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,480
some viral infectious diseases

696
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,720
indeed this prevention

697
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
is more important

698
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but

699
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
it basic means i do therapy

700
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It is better to do prevention

701
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
this is my interpretation

702
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
prevention is more important

703
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
treatment is not that important

704
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm still mad about this

705
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
He says this every time

706
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
step on me

707
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So I am concerned about prevention

708
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
also noticed

709
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It says prevention is important

710
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I miss everyone Dangemen Franklin

711
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Everyone in the United States probably knows

712
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Avatar on a dollar bill

713
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Is George Washington

714
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Five bucks is April Hen Lincoln

715
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
This avatar Dangemen Franklin

716
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
It's above a hundred dollars

717
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
so what he said

718
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Probably Carry Waite

719
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
so i paid attention

720
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
this matter

721
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
It is the study of Pharmacology

722
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Farmacology

723
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Part of it is the study of Drogometabolism

724
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Some say Drogometabolism should be nothing

725
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
there is nothing

726
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,600
particularly important

727
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,160
I can't say it's not important

728
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,520
I'd say it seems to be simpler.

729
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,280
Then he is doing pharmacology

730
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,000
I later became the farmacology chair

731
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,920
OK

732
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,800
But I don't know anything about farmacology

733
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,840
Inside the farmacology

734
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,200
zorg metabolism has face 1 face 2

735
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,920
The enzyme of this zorg metabolism

736
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,360
Then he is studying face 2 enzyme

737
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,960
OK

738
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,640
I will not talk about the mechanosome

739
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,280
I'll start with why this is so important

740
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,560
This broccoli was in the 80s

741
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,560
他叫the vegetable of the 80s in the United States

742
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,160
OK

743
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,960
Then this George Bush senior

744
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,960
He was the 41st President of the United States at the time

745
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,640
what he hates the most is broccoli

746
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,680
he forbids broccoli in the white house

747
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,640
He also forbids him to use air force one

748
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,320
topped with broccoli

749
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
so he just doesn't eat

750
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
He can't even eat mosquitoes

751
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Why are you so afraid of Broccoli?

752
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
In fact, many animals are afraid of the flow

753
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Like Wassabi, for example

754
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
It also carries the same ITC

755
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Just like in Broccoli

756
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So its taste is very irritating and strong

757
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Its purpose is actually to make those herbivorous animals

758
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Just remember not to eat this

759
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Once you eat it, you will never dare to eat it again

760
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I guess its taste

761
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
tastebar may have mutation

762
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It's the same as these vegetarian ones

763
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Herbivorous animals are more like

764
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It has a great influence on them

765
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
that's the two of them running

766
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That Bill Lincoln's wife Hillary Clinton

767
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
was still very young

768
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
she carry a sign

769
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
what is written on it

770
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
That's Broccoli in grass fed

771
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,200
That's the slogan that won the election

772
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,000
OK

773
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Because after what he told me

774
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,800
the same night

775
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,300
I watch CBS, CNN

776
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,300
All the news is reporting on this matter

777
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,100
Then start digging it all out

778
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,000
All news related to this Blockley

779
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,600
at the time of the election

780
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,000
That is almost the end of 1991

781
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Early 91

782
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,800
January is about to take office

783
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
OK

784
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,200
so i think this is interesting

785
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,800
but really

786
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Really I think Blockley's contribution

787
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,200
In research is actually the journal

788
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,300
It is cancer prevention journal

789
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,000
is the founding

790
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,100
In fact, it did not start until 2008

791
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,000
OK

792
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,600
OK

793
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,600
what is his role

794
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,200
this is very important

795
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,200
OK

796
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,000
First

797
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,760
That is to say, the isothiocyaninate I just talked about

798
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,760
It is this active ingredient

799
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,760
But it's inside this broccoli

800
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
it is not this form

801
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
It is the precursor

802
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
is glucosynolate

803
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
it is inactive

804
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
It is catalyzed by enzymes

805
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Then it becomes an ITC

806
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,760
is the ITC that can get in the way

807
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,760
This enzyme is normal

808
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
To release it use mechanical chewing

809
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
you are for this sender

810
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
not boiled broccoli

811
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
you bite with your mouth, bite, bite

812
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
crush

813
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
The mirocinase to release

814
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
Just convert this to this

815
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
ITC active component

816
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
so it's important

817
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
because of these things

818
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
this dietary thing

819
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
some are eaten raw

820
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
sometimes cooked

821
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Everyone may be more familiar

822
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
Then this is to eat broccoli raw

823
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So how does it prevent cancer?

824
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
In fact, Machinazine is quite clear

825
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
We use Sophorefine which is the ingredient in Broccoli

826
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Let's see what its mechanism is

827
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Because they are all Pure Components to see this System

828
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
what happened

829
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
The answer is that it will Activate Nerve 2

830
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
What I just said is this Compound

831
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
This is the Enzyme Transcription Factor

832
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
It is called by a thing called E3-Li-Gaze

833
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
wrap it up

834
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It will degreate it normally

835
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So its Concentration is very low

836
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
But Sophorefine will Inactivate

837
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It this E3-Li-Gaze

838
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Make it a lot of Release will not be Degreate

839
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So you can activate many, many things

840
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The words here are so-called

841
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
inside

842
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
This anti-oxidant enzyme

843
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It is the most important class in what I am talking about now

844
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
later on

845
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
NERV2 also controls another class

846
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That is mitochondria quality control

847
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
The problem

848
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Detailed mechanism

849
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Let's compare

850
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It is the chemical reaction

851
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
how did it happen

852
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
The e3 ligase I just talked about

853
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
How does it react with sulfuric acid

854
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
This is its chemistry

855
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
其實 the chemistry is quite interesting

856
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
i took that one off

857
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
because the so-called

858
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Because of this sulfur

859
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It's the electron

860
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
is the nucleus farther away

861
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So it is more polarizable

862
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
generally

863
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
nucleophilic reaction

864
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
to nucleophile with its

865
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
electrophilic center

866
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
it is a relationship

867
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
That is to say it is very big

868
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Its electrons outside are far away

869
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
it's also in the electronics center

870
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Its electrons are also far away from the atomic box

871
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
This is called Heart

872
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
This is called Soft to Soft Match

873
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Heart to Heart Match

874
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So it's a Soft to Soft reaction

875
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
in Biology

876
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Including Biochemistry inside

877
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
This K is too much

878
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
that is all you need to know is this

879
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
This is called Micro reaction

880
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
you'll see what's going on

881
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
many are like this

882
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Then in the simple experiment on Base

883
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
This Model is actually very simple

884
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Of course, various Regulations are not considered.

885
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That is to say, ITC is the ingredient in this Blockly

886
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,000
How does it prevent the production of ROS

887
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
not its generation

888
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
How to lower its level

889
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
OK

890
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,960
It can be wrong just saw a whole bunch of antioxidant enzymes

891
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,260
This antioxidant enzyme can reduce the level of active oxygen

892
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:14,440
Of course D will not cause DNA mutation

893
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,680
This cancer will not happen

894
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,400
This is a reasonable process

895
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,760
Why is ROS so important in the human body?

896
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,840
wait a minute i'll talk

897
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:32,840
It becomes something that has to happen inside the human body

898
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:38,840
It is also bound to DNA, which will inevitably cause cancer

899
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:43,240
It's not like saying that you eat Karlsnokin in the human body and there is no

900
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,440
ROS produced in the human body

901
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,840
It causes DNA damage mutation

902
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
OK

903
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,840
Then let's talk about this longevity

904
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,240
Then come compare this

905
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,040
What is the commonality between cancer prevention and cold reception?

906
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
The most famous molecule in Longevity is the so-called red wine tree Respiatrl

907
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Then this Respiatrl knows that it is an anti-aging molecule

908
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
That's what the West discovered

909
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
OK

910
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It does this experiment a lot in various animal systems

911
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
In various model systems

912
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
From East all the way to big animals

913
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Do everything except human

914
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It has anti-aging activity

915
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
can lead to longevity

916
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
OK

917
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
This has long been the case in the East

918
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Heshou

919
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
OK

920
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Let's see the next one

921
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
This compoundRespiatrl is a polyphenol class

922
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Nature is a lot of polyphenol like this

923
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
OK

924
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Then it has a lot of activities

925
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
ROS is active oxygen

926
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,200
that it exploded this

927
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,000
There are a lot of so-called chronic diseases

928
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,600
OK everyone is like this

929
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,000
Without exception

930
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,500
OK

931
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,900
The nuclear guards in the east already knew

932
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,300
it can cause longevity

933
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,200
OK

934
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,900
Then its this ingredient

935
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,900
What are active ingredients?

936
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,000
Just like this Respire True is actually the same

937
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,900
Except it has an extra Guccoside

938
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,100
Just added a Guccoside on top

939
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,500
Increase its Water Solubility

940
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,600
So it is more water soluble

941
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,900
This is not Water Soluble

942
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,200
OK

943
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,400
Then I compared it

944
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,200
It's the former nuclei

945
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,700
words in this red wine

946
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,200
Equal to how many liters of red wine

947
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,600
the answer is

948
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,700
The previous nuclear guard needs to be equal to

949
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
sorry

950
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
1L Red Wine is less than 10mg

951
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
The 1000 hand milk is 200mg

952
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Therefore, 20L Red Wine is equal to 1000 hand milk

953
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
ok

954
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Then if we directly compare Drive Way, it is from Gripped Skin

955
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
It is Red Grape Skin

956
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Comparing Drive Skin with Drive the Powder of Hand Lotion

957
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
That's almost 100 times 0.2mg versus 20mg

958
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
ok

959
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
that's 100 times worse

960
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Then wait for the next one

961
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Let me show you this hand-to-hand breast turn

962
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's what Li Ao wrote

963
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Didn't Li Ao just passed away?

964
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's that Han Yu's big address

965
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
ok

966
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
He, Liu Zhongyuan and Li Ao were all in the Tang Dynasty

967
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
very famous writer and thinker

968
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Then he wrote this sympathetic breast turn

969
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I'll talk about it soon

970
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,200
I find it very interesting

971
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,200
That is to say, this field, He Tianer

972
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,800
This is very weak

973
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,900
Year fifty-eight five-seven children

974
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,800
Then this story I think is edited

975
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,400
I don't know if this is real or fake

976
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,600
it is the river hand house turning it into powder

977
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,240
Then take the hollow wine before

978
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,440
Hollow is the aperitif

979
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,940
Just soak it in wine

980
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,540
It used to be about a teaspoon or so

981
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,940
it ate

982
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,540
Seven days after eating, he lost his humanity

983
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:41,940
it says it is

984
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,140
In fact, all antioxidants have this thing

985
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,140
have this use

986
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,640
four months strong

987
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,140
Therefore Changfu is increased to two thousand

988
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,740
After two thousand, everyone will meet

989
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,140
Fa Wu Rong Shao

990
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,240
Vegetarian male within ten years

991
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,840
Rename Nengzhi and become He Nengzhi

992
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,400
That's 160 years old with Flag Yanxiu

993
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,840
Na Yeon-soo's raw house is the house of Japanese hands

994
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,240
that is his grandson

995
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,760
Teya takes medicine for a lifetime, the number is 130 years old, the hair is oily and black

996
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,400
ok, then this is his record

997
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,760
I looked at this and I said yes

998
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,800
quite interesting

999
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,160
because

1000
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,640
Antiaxin is indeed

1001
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,800
I know it has an impact on sexual function

1002
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:29,640
like

1003
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,160
Just like monks can't eat green onions

1004
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,200
inside the onion

1005
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,640
forgot to tell you a story

1006
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,320
The first thing I do when I come to Taiwan

1007
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,120
I just saw that the green onions in Taiwan are delicious

1008
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,120
Ask others and they say it's a three-star green onion

1009
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,560
I see how the scallion pancakes made with Samsung scallions are so delicious

1010
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,280
I'll be there

1011
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,000
arrive

1012
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,440
What is Yilan?

1013
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
Yilan that

1014
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,040
What is that Marine

1015
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,080
Marine Life is the best cattle farm

1016
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,880
I went after

1017
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
eat with them, chat with them

1018
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I asked them and I said you this

1019
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
What's the matter with this Samsung onion?

1020
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Why is it so white and so big

1021
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
It's delicious. I said he said

1022
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Samsung onion words

1023
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Green onions that grow in three-star boxes are called three-star green onions

1024
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
You take the three-star onion somewhere else

1025
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
this is common onion

1026
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So I want to say Samsung onion

1027
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Because onion is

1028
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
That is to say a lot of ears

1029
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Only plowing ears will absorb these

1030
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Heavy Metal knows

1031
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
OK

1032
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That's because America is doing

1033
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Sylenion

1034
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Kimo Prevention Trial

1035
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It proves that Sylenion

1036
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
prevents all cancers

1037
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
50% of the time they do experiments

1038
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It was the same when I went to mainland China to do the same

1039
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Continental put Inorganic Sylenion

1040
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
added to their R&D

1041
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
just go inside the experiment

1042
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
when he eats

1043
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,660
Let's go under the inflammation, just add Sinanite

1044
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,000
The result is the same

1045
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,360
They are more than 20,000 people

1046
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,360
Kinpo Prevention experiment

1047
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,040
same result 50%

1048
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,540
Effects of Kinpo Prevention

1049
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,880
so i wanna say this

1050
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,080
This Samsung Chong of Samsung Chong

1051
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,500
will it be

1052
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,880
Absorbed a lot of Sylenium

1053
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,840
I asked them why they were

1054
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,840
Upper Nanyang Creek

1055
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,340
only in that place

1056
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,640
they mean this

1057
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,880
because it's raining

1058
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,880
it was raining

1059
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,880
The upper reaches of the Chong Nanyang Creek

1060
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,380
that soil

1061
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,380
all by this

1062
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,080
the one above

1063
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,380
there is a frame on it

1064
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,380
He said that box is

1065
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,880
A box for Sylenium on top

1066
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,880
So when I heard this

1067
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,680
i knew what was going on

1068
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,180
That is

1069
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,680
In the soil of that Samsung Chong

1070
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,680
Absorb a lot

1071
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,680
So it absorbs Sylenium

1072
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,680
That Sylenium becomes

1073
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,880
Sylenol-16

1074
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,880
It is the 21st amino acid

1075
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
It is generally 20 amino acid

1076
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,880
but in fact

1077
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,540
When Cylenion is around

1078
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,400
And Cylenion is necessary

1079
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,960
everyone doesn't have words

1080
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,680
the antioxidant capacity will decrease

1081
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,680
A lot of Peroxide these

1082
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,680
All have 21st amino acid in it

1083
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,560
As far as Samsung onion is actually

1084
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,680
Absorbed a whole lot of Cylenion

1085
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,640
Turn it into Organic's Cylenol compound

1086
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,320
OK

1087
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,700
so it might be right

1088
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,400
Cancer prevention may have great function

1089
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,440
or right

1090
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,360
Longevity may have a function

1091
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,120
just should do some study

1092
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,120
look what's going on with the people over there

1093
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,320
OK

1094
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,280
Well

1095
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,400
OK

1096
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,560
Then this is obvious

1097
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,560
that is

1098
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,240
Is there something in the nuclear house

1099
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,000
and

1100
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,440
can live longer

1101
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,400
OK

1102
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,440
Probably something antioxidant

1103
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,120
Now I know the last one

1104
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,800
speak

1105
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,440
i.e. 10%

1106
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,200
of the driveway of Nuke House

1107
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,600
That's the compound

1108
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,240
It is Ratio

1109
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,400
Respondent Glucoside

1110
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,600
Just add Glucose on it

1111
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,000
this is never heard

1112
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,800
That's 10% of the driveway

1113
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,900
Usually these plants

1114
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,700
component of its medicine

1115
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,400
are very low

1116
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
a few tenths percent

1117
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,200
Respondent Glucoside in this nucleus

1118
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,300
is 10%

1119
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,200
possibly even higher

1120
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,800
depends on the time of the harvest

1121
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,600
is it autumn or where

1122
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,500
when

1123
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,600
That poor teacher knows better

1124
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,000
Quiet didn't come

1125
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,100
i think that's interesting

1126
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,100
that is

1127
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,000
East already knew

1128
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,500
It is the Rat Grape studied by the West

1129
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
it thinks it's inside the red wine

1130
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,500
Respondent Glucoside Causes Longevity

1131
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,000
correct

1132
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,200
Respondent Glucoside Can Cause Longevity

1133
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,700
But the amount of red wine is actually not enough

1134
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,600
Because we know it costs a dollar

1135
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,800
After a week, I spent two dollars

1136
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,300
Two dollars is equivalent to

1137
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,600
40 L of Rat Wine

1138
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
but unlikely

1139
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
OK

1140
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
This is very strong, this powerful, this

1141
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
anti-oxidant

1142
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Then its mechanism is also very clear

1143
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
that is

1144
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
OK

1145
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What is its mechanism

1146
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
The same is activate nerve 2

1147
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
OK

1148
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
But its activation

1149
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It is related to the ITC in the Broccoli just mentioned

1150
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
is a little bit different

1151
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I just talked about this ITC

1152
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It is directly related to its E3 ligase

1153
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Just take it as the repressor to remove it

1154
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
OK

1155
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
that activate it

1156
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Then this Respondent

1157
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
It is the accelerated group on it

1158
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
take it off

1159
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
on deacceleration

1160
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
after remove acceleration

1161
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
it becomes functional nerve 2

1162
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You can trigger this transcription

1163
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,000
many, many genes

1164
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
OK

1165
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
anti-oxidant enzyme

1166
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Then this is their mechanism

1167
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
common mechanism

1168
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,740
Nerve to the level

1169
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,940
It can induce antioxidant enzyme

1170
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,940
This is a very clear thing

1171
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,540
not proposed model is very simple

1172
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,380
It is the words of ITC

1173
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,540
It is via Nerve to the activation

1174
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,640
produce antioxidant enzyme

1175
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,240
to reduce ROS

1176
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,940
ROS是responsible for DNA mutation

1177
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,780
Here its ROS is actually a question mark

1178
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,940
This is Mitacondria

1179
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,300
90% of its production comes from Mitacondria

1180
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,940
Its DNA mutation in Mitacondria

1181
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,580
It's about Azinc

1182
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:42,480
It is if the damage is caused by Nuclear DNA

1183
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,340
是Nuclear DNA mutation

1184
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,840
its result is cancer

1185
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,940
i need to spend a little time

1186
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,140
sorry

1187
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,340
Tell me about antioxidant water

1188
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:58,080
Antioxidant water was mentioned just now

1189
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,680
First, let’s talk about Yinjishui

1190
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Cathol's water is called yin ridge water

1191
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
There are many names that you can see on the market.

1192
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
It is called alkaline water, rotten hoof juice water

1193
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Some people call it energy water, but it is actually rotten hydrogen water

1194
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Then this Cathol water is you electrolyzing

1195
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
During electrolysis, your Cathol will give this Electron

1196
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Just put Electron into the water

1197
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
That side is the opposite, OK

1198
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So here's hydrogen, here's oxygen

1199
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
For hydrogen, it is this reaction

1200
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
That is to say, its Electron goes into the water

1201
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Water is a balance, it is acid, that is, Proton and OH- are a balance

1202
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Then PK is Qi, OK, so it is a balance here

1203
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Then if you two electrons go in

1204
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:00,000
You take this two Protons and turn it into hydrogen

1205
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
clean atoms and then become clean molecules

1206
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,500
OK

1207
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,800
So in fact its action is clear

1208
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,300
It is hydrogen rich water

1209
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,300
Then this hydrogen rich water has long been proved by others

1210
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,500
That is to say, you only need to produce hydrogen

1211
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,000
Even if you put a magnetian stick

1212
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,100
just put it in the water

1213
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,700
it produces hydrogen

1214
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,500
as long as there is hydrogen

1215
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,000
It can trigger the nerve to reaction just mentioned

1216
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,300
It is the anti-cancer that we are talking about

1217
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:32,100
It's the same as the molecules in this longivotty

1218
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,200
Both activate the same nerve to

1219
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:35,800
OK

1220
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,500
like energy water

1221
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,100
Have you probably heard of it?

1222
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,500
In the past, the long-rooted, who-the-principal was not called selling

1223
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:49,500
What did the long root say?

1224
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,900
Just sell that before I sold that energy water

1225
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,000
I just read what he said about energy water

1226
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,600
He said put some crystals on this

1227
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,300
put in that cup

1228
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,100
inside that one cup

1229
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
shake it for 10 minutes

1230
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Put in Counterclockwise and shake for 10 minutes

1231
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
That is energy water

1232
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I also said he didn't know what he was talking about

1233
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
where is the energy

1234
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Then I thought about it

1235
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It is actually caused by energy water

1236
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
friction between stone and water

1237
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Make the electrons release from the stone to the water

1238
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It is exactly the same as this reaction

1239
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
electrons into water

1240
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
This experiment was conducted by Professor Liu Yichuan

1241
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
This experiment was done for the first time

1242
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
I think this is a very powerful experiment

1243
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
is that it is the gold

1244
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
It is the Nano particle of gold

1245
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Burn it in this Porsche-Land

1246
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
above the ball

1247
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So its surface is quite large

1248
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Then it illuminates it with Green LED Light

1249
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Then its gold electrons will release

1250
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
That electron

1251
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
into the water to produce this reaction

1252
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
we already know this

1253
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
ok

1254
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
What about the fair price of this electricity?

1255
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It can also actually nerve to

1256
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
So there are two reactions

1257
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
This reaction is more powerful

1258
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It is AU plus 1

1259
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
the nerved interaction

1260
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
ok

1261
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
i want to hurry up

1262
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
later

1263
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
ok now the most important thing is

1264
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
common mechanism for cancer prevention and longevity

1265
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
i think last

1266
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The conclusion mentioned is actually very un-expected

1267
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
ok

1268
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
is the last

1269
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
real aging

1270
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And why can prevent old age

1271
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
not saying yes

1272
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
make life span extend

1273
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
is to make you age slowly

1274
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
no

1275
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It has rejuvenation component

1276
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
inside

1277
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I'll tell you later

1278
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Now everyone is actually researching

1279
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Just use stem cell

1280
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
how to rejuvenate

1281
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,560
are other cells

1282
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,560
ok

1283
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,400
ok

1284
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,720
That world NIRV2

1285
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,400
return

1286
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,920
Also control two reactions

1287
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,920
ok

1288
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,920
one

1289
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,000
not control two

1290
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,920
It is control mitochondrial quality

1291
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,040
Another one is

1292
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,320
ROS generation is

1293
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,520
M mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation

1294
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,840
produced

1295
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,600
ok

1296
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
That

1297
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,120
this reaction

1298
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,800
is a very important reaction

1299
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,360
I'll tell you later

1300
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,320
Then this is a relatively simple M mitochondria

1301
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,800
How to generate ROS

1302
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,320
Then this Agent theory

1303
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,520
It is M mitochondrial theory of agent

1304
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,240
Actually well established

1305
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,080
ok

1306
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,200
So why does it generate ROS

1307
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,120
affect aging

1308
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,480
it causes aging

1309
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,240
ok

1310
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,640
how to prevent it

1311
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,240
Let me tell you later

1312
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:51,120
ok

1313
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:54,080
This is M mitochondria free radical theory of agent

1314
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,080
ok

1315
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,000
That

1316
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,040
very simple

1317
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:57,960
That is to say

1318
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,600
In M mitochondria the ox

1319
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,080
because to

1320
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
it does temp. andra for the first for the relation

1321
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Its Electron Transport chain

1322
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
In fact it will leak

1323
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
This Electron

1324
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Prematurely would go with this Oxygen

1325
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
React causes Super Oxide

1326
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
wait a minute so everyone can see

1327
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
that reaction

1328
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
What's happening in the Electron Transport chain

1329
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Then it comes out of ROS

1330
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
It's Super Oxide It's a ROS

1331
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
That Super Oxide

1332
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Of course there is also this SOD in MetaCondria

1333
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It is Super Oxide Dismutase

1334
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
But did not completely remove this ROS

1335
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So 90% of ROS

1336
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
are generated by

1337
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
This one in MetaCondria

1338
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Oxidative first for relation

1339
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
This reaction is actually a

1340
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Vicious cycle

1341
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
MetaCondria this

1342
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Free radical theory of agent is no problem

1343
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
This Vicious cycle is a little controversial

1344
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
So I won't talk about it for now

1345
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,540
Normal ROS can be inside normal cells

1346
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,840
It is Generate 50,000, that is, 50,000 DNA lesion per cell per day

1347
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,840
OK

1348
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,960
so many of these

1349
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,160
The Oxidative DNA damage

1350
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,840
Part of it will cause DNA mutation

1351
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,540
OK

1352
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,840
The resulting mutation is

1353
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,840
Not just point mutation

1354
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,140
made like

1355
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,960
It is caused by transversion

1356
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,400
就是pure into permitting the mutation

1357
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,200
It can also cause rearrangement

1358
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
So like translocation

1359
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,600
so it is possible to be

1360
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,800
cause

1361
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,400
Low array

1362
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,360
Because the short array is mainly mutation

1363
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,100
cause various mutations

1364
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,740
There is a point mutation

1365
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:49,600
有translocation mutation

1366
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,100
The mutation spectrum

1367
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,300
If it is complete, it is easy to cause a short formation

1368
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:53,700
OK

1369
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,200
it will cause

1370
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,740
That caused Aging is in the Metacondure

1371
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,740
can cause Aging

1372
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,720
It caused this DNA damage, Meta-Country DNA,

1373
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,280
soda-ROS damage, causing mutation,

1374
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,080
Final impact Oxidated phosphorylation efficiency,

1375
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,840
Will cause more ROS releases.

1376
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,600
This is the same as everyone using the inhibitor,

1377
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:23,440
If you want to use Retinal, you need to make Induce Parkinson's compound,

1378
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,560
Retinal, it is complex 1 inhibitor,

1379
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,120
You add that inhibitor,

1380
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,000
Its ROS leakage,

1381
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,200
More come out from complex 1.

1382
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,800
So normally,

1383
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,560
You first see me circle it up,

1384
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,400
In Electron Transport Chain,

1385
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:45,480
That is, there is a release on complex 1, and there is also a release on complex 3,

1386
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,160
two one.

1387
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,440
Then these releases are necessary,

1388
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,240
is the inevitable release,

1389
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,000
So it creates problems with ROS.

1390
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,800
Then its protein gradient,

1391
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
It is establish program gradient

1392
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Finally, it is used for complexified, which is ATP synthesis

1393
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Make ATP for energy

1394
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
OK, this is what I think the most important thing is to talk about this

1395
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
From now on, these are the most important

1396
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
OK, I was thinking

1397
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
That is to say, Mitocondria is different from Nuclear DNA

1398
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Because Nuclear has only one cell, there is only one Nuclear

1399
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But a cell has thousands

1400
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
possibly millions

1401
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Right inside the Nural, it's a million Mitocondria

1402
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Usually about a thousand

1403
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
depends on what cell

1404
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Then when you damage this Mitocondria

1405
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
you are not...

1406
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Not all of them have the same damage

1407
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
It is a random distribution

1408
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
OK

1409
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,560
for example, a simple case

1410
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,400
Suppose your damage is in the agent process

1411
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:14,440
You damaged part of most of the metacondria

1412
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,240
then you have some good ones

1413
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,240
Well because it's a lot of metacondria

1414
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,720
So I can use a process

1415
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:24,080
It is metapholyte

1416
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,880
Just put the damage metacondria degrade

1417
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,720
Then put the good expand biogenesis

1418
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,440
When I did this slide, I did this slide eight years ago

1419
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,360
I don't know if there is such a thing

1420
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:41,200
That is, you can put the quality of metacondria

1421
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,440
restore it

1422
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,560
It is the reservation of metacondria quality

1423
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,600
If you can restore

1424
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,240
then it may be getting younger

1425
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,120
Because it is the quality of metacondria

1426
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,380
literal

1427
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:04,260
And there is yo

1428
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,140
Then for example it's very simple

1429
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:12,020
Here are my grades

1430
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:13,560
included

1431
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,840
not complete

1432
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:17,440
Do you want

1433
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,240
going down

1434
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,420
press eno for you

1435
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,440
so

1436
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,540
it

1437
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,760
Later, I found out that this really happened.

1438
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:05,260
I just talked about this Nerve2

1439
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:09,060
In addition to controlling this Antioxidant enzyme

1440
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:11,460
It also controls two things

1441
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,460
One is called Metaphagy

1442
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,660
as I just said

1443
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,000
It will put bad Metacondria

1444
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
degrade it

1445
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,500
OK

1446
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,460
is to go through autofogism

1447
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,460
degrade it

1448
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,960
The other one is Biogenesis

1449
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,960
It will put good Metacondria

1450
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,460
prophereate it

1451
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,460
do so much

1452
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,460
It's the same as the Emo I talked about

1453
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,460
just say there is such a thing

1454
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,460
And this is Ctrl by Nerve2

1455
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:37,460
So Nerve2 is in addition to Ctrl antioxidant

1456
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:41,460
It also avoids ROS generation from Metacondria

1457
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,460
so words

1458
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:46,460
The direction it turns into is very very important

1459
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,460
It is Nerve2

1460
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,460
OK

1461
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,460
Then can we rejuvenate

1462
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,460
Can we rejuvenate when we age

1463
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,460
Can rejuvenate back

1464
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,460
OK

1465
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
English probably means rejuvenation

1466
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Is it possible to rejuvenate

1467
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
actually can

1468
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
This Parabelsus has been doing it for hundreds of years

1469
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Hetochronic Parabelsus

1470
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
the so-called conjoined symbiosis

1471
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
i.e. an old mouse

1472
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
with a young mouse

1473
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
put it in the circulating system

1474
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
join it up

1475
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
look at this old mouse

1476
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
will you get younger

1477
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
This has been done for fifty years

1478
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
But because the operation is not that simple

1479
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
reproducibility is not particularly good

1480
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And I didn't know then

1481
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
what the hell is going on with this

1482
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
It's clearer now

1483
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
now i think it's pretty clear

1484
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
In 2022 is this year

1485
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Just two papers

1486
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
One is from the Chinese Academy of Sciences

1487
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
It is the Chinese Academy of Sciences in mainland China

1488
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
One is Stanford's scientist

1489
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
published the same experiment

1490
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,280
It is after putting this joint

1491
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,780
One is a two-month-old mouse and one is a nine-month-old mouse

1492
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,080
you joint it

1493
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:10,680
circulation system

1494
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,780
Then go see it in five weeks

1495
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,280
Because it depends on aging

1496
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,780
it watched for a long time

1497
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,480
is problematic

1498
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,480
It takes five weeks to see

1499
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,480
The current technology is more advanced

1500
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,600
it can see

1501
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,600
用single cell transcriptome analysis

1502
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,600
see all tissues

1503
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,500
to see the extent of its regumination

1504
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,000
It turns out that there is indeed

1505
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:37,000
in the old mouse

1506
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,200
nine month old mouse

1507
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,800
five weeks later

1508
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,400
it all becomes younger its cells

1509
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,800
Because it uses single cell

1510
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,300
Methods of RNA sequencing

1511
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,000
look at it this

1512
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,200
transcript abundance

1513
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:52,900
OK

1514
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,700
So it is equivalent to a

1515
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:57,300
fingerprint of

1516
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,600
aging the mouse

1517
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,600
all the tissues

1518
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:10,000
He also found that he would systematize the muscles of the muscles

1519
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Then cause the muscle to become muscular and the muscularization of the muscle

1520
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Afterwards, the entire brain and each muscle that cause the muscles to become younger

1521
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
This experiment is of course very important

1522
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
That is to say, it means that as long as you learn from each other

1523
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Then you old rat can rejuvenate

1524
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
that is rejuvenation

1525
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
If it is rejuvenation, it is very important to treat some diseases of the elderly

1526
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
ok

1527
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
ok

1528
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
then there are some experiments

1529
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
It is another paper, amble report

1530
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
also two years ago

1531
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It is a demonstrate MSC, just missing camels stem cell

1532
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Actually it's not obvious

1533
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,420
I think it's probably not Stem cell

1534
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,660
是Missing Camel, Stominal Cell

1535
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:07,460
Or Stem Progenitor Cell

1536
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,540
It can transfer mitochondria

1537
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,200
to immune cells, in vitro and in vivo

1538
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,420
What about that? That is to say

1539
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:19,660
You have MSC and HSC in your blood

1540
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,660
It is Hematopoietic Stem Cell

1541
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:24,260
Stem cell Progenitor Cell, cannot...

1542
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,220
There are also MSC and HSC

1543
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:30,680
Is that what these two are causing rejuvenation

1544
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:33,020
Because most people guess

1545
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:35,520
Rejuvenation caused by Stem cell

1546
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,220
What is the rejuvenation mechanism?

1547
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:40,840
It is actually called mitochondria transfer

1548
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,020
it means

1549
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:44,520
It can take its young mitochondria

1550
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,220
transfer to the elderly

1551
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,640
what's going on

1552
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,640
How does it transfer this matter?

1553
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,440
There are a lot of experiments

1554
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,520
Now everyone is doing and thinking

1555
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,520
It means you are...

1556
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,020
Are you going to use young mitochondria

1557
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,020
to rejuvenate

1558
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
The old stem cell

1559
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Then the old stem cell can patrol

1560
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
right in the blood

1561
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
It can contact all tissue

1562
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:14,000
That's the old tissue resident stem cell

1563
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
revitalize all

1564
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
is to rejuvenate

1565
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
ok

1566
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
then this thing

1567
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
is very important

1568
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Now everyone is studying

1569
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Now everyone is doing stem cell research

1570
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Then I finally want to end

1571
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I just want to say that I mentioned it earlier.

1572
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Just in medicine be your food

1573
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Has anyone actually taken pills like food?

1574
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
ok

1575
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
One person is Li Qingyun

1576
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
he died in 1933

1577
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
In fact, at the time of the warlord opera

1578
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
In Sichuan, it is the one with Yangsheng

1579
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
write a biography for him

1580
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Li Qingyun

1581
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
he lived to be 256

1582
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
why no one will believe

1583
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,600
live to 256

1584
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,000
show us what's going on with it

1585
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,400
I looked carefully

1586
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,440
because of the emperor

1587
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,920
the emperor of the qing dynasty

1588
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:10,720
Give him an award every once in a while

1589
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:11,960
longevity award

1590
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,200
OK

1591
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,640
So what's going on with this?

1592
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,840
it really is actually

1593
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,640
that food is your food

1594
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,240
it's 40 years old

1595
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,120
it's the medicine that lives in the medicine

1596
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,080
what is it

1597
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,520
It's zero, dog chicken, wild nuclear hand black chicken blood

1598
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,120
then add rice wine

1599
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,480
OK

1600
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,720
Eat these things for 40 years

1601
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,120
that didn't eat anything else

1602
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:35,680
probably very little

1603
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,840
In fact, there are probably very few

1604
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,000
it's in the mountains

1605
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,920
OK

1606
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,920
That lived 256 years

1607
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,720
The current argument is not

1608
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,200
because it was a hit

1609
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,800
it was 1933

1610
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,880
be it wait

1611
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,720
It was 1933

1612
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,960
words at that time

1613
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,240
What about this news in the New York Times

1614
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,440
All major journals have

1615
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,840
Britain also sent this regiment

1616
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,840
Try them on to visit their local people

1617
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,440
see what's going on

1618
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,440
OK

1619
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,600
So I think it's good for everyone to take a look at this

1620
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,240
Is it true after all?

1621
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,640
I guess there's probably a little bit of authenticity in it

1622
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,600
OK

1623
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,080
That is to say, if it is really like Practice

1624
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,640
can live a long time

1625
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,480
but what?

1626
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,240
At that time there was no such Parabiosis

1627
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,940
Did not play Stem Cell

1628
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,240
就Young Stem Cell

1629
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,740
They want to play the Stem Cell in the waiting room

1630
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:34,640
go inside the older people

1631
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,680
so many people beat

1632
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,440
even though it hasn't really been

1633
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,140
approval to do these things

1634
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:41,800
I guess

1635
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,280
Actually I know someone who does

1636
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,280
OK

1637
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,380
finally

1638
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:49,880
that is

1639
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:50,840
I thank you all

1640
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,680
It was when I was in Beijing Medical University

1641
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,080
I followed a group of Scientists

1642
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,380
跟As Crazy As I Am

1643
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,120
Everyone is studying what is going on with this He Shouwu

1644
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
At that time, Samsung Onion also made

1645
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
He can also activate NERD2

1646
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
we know

1647
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
OK

1648
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
that also hope

1649
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
thank you for your attention

1650
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I hope everyone is healthy

1651
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Longevity

1652
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But what I'm probably talking about should be

1653
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Longevity of two hundred years is better

1654
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
good

1655
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
OK thank you all

1656
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Thank you Mr. Liu Fang

1657
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
very brilliant speech

1658
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
so now we have time for you to ask questions

1659
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Did we encourage everyone

1660
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
some prizes

1661
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
right

1662
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
OK yes

1663
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
good thing right?

1664
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Academician Liu, thank you for your speech

1665
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
then i want to ask a

1666
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
is about

1667
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
The problem of cancer and laborization

1668
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
you just mentioned

1669
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
just a lot

1670
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
anticancer and that

1671
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Those Mechanisms of Huang Laohua

1672
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,240
then one thing i was thinking about is

1673
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,800
From hindrance to anti-cancer and even to aging

1674
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,680
Will these three things about anti-aging become true?

1675
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,480
It's a bit like three gears stuck together and turning

1676
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,120
Because the reason I say this is because

1677
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,960
It's just three gears stuck together

1678
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,680
They just connect to each other and they won't turn around like this

1679
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:21,680
Because the reason I say this is because

1680
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,880
It is because Cancer taught itself that it has a characteristic that is

1681
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,840
it is immortal

1682
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,440
It is translated into Chinese and should be immortal

1683
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:31,640
So if we say that as we just mentioned

1684
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,640
Is there a kashou house?

1685
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,840
It can go to prevent aging words

1686
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,360
Would it be the other way around?

1687
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,080
exploited by cancer cells

1688
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:44,040
And on the other hand, in 2002

1689
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,560
just have a team

1690
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,400
He is working on a paper in Nature Published

1691
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,160
Then it is pointed out above that

1692
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,360
They put a very typical one

1693
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,520
tumor suppressant feed that

1694
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,200
That makes its Bunchin stronger

1695
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
For example, the virus model

1696
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
like osteoporosis

1697
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Then the birth reduction and that

1698
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
That's some symptom of aging

1699
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Does that mean we have no other way?

1700
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It is to achieve anti-aging and anti-aging at the same time

1701
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
OK

1702
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Thanks

1703
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
good question

1704
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
that microphone

1705
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
In fact, cancer

1706
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
sorry

1707
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
The occurrence of cancer is actually more clearly studied

1708
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
OK

1709
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
that is to say

1710
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It's that animal model

1711
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Like the skin model is actually very good

1712
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
It is point mutation

1713
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
like oncogen

1714
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
It is to initiate tumor genesis

1715
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
After this promotion step

1716
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
That promotion is constant stimulation

1717
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
like using a tumor promoter

1718
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
like phobolester

1719
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
PKC causes ROS

1720
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,000
It will also activate ROS and Calcium to cause mucogenesis

1721
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So it will accumulate various mutations

1722
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
The most important thing is mutation

1723
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So the generation of the whole cancer

1724
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Mainly all kinds of mutation

1725
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It is the oncogen tumor suppressor

1726
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Of course, there is tumor promotion caused by phobolester

1727
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
These phenomena

1728
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
this tells us

1729
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:38,000
It is to prevent cancer and prevent aging

1730
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
The difference inside is actually Mitocondria

1731
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Function with Mitocondria in cancer

1732
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
no more than in this

1733
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Mainly nuclear function

1734
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It is the mutation caused on nuclear DNA

1735
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Various mutations are the cause of cancer

1736
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
What about the Mitocondria mutation

1737
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It is what causes ROS

1738
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,600
The release of ROS I talked about is more

1739
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,160
So the two are not exactly the same

1740
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:10,500
Are these two related?

1741
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:18,440
Cancer is an associated disease of aging

1742
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:25,340
I just said that it is easy for the elderly to produce more ROS

1743
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:30,340
It leaked or cytoplasm it will cause the mutation of nuclear DNA to increase

1744
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:34,340
So this old man is prone to cancer

1745
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:38,340
Then the increase of this ROS is not a linear increase

1746
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:44,340
When you are old, the production of ROS is exponential

1747
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,340
Why why do people propose vicious cycle

1748
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:51,340
That's it, it's getting stronger and stronger

1749
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,340
It's not a linear it's an exponential curve

1750
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:59,340
It's just like what I usually see and say it's right

1751
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
For biochemistry, it is called elosteric effect

1752
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,960
like hemoglobin oxidized half the first

1753
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:11,000
The second is that sorbionic is easy half more

1754
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That is a positive co-operativity

1755
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
There are many phenomena in biochemistry

1756
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
There is negative feedback

1757
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Then there is positive feedback

1758
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
The most famous positive feedback system is

1759
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
pro-inflammatory

1760
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It's inflammation

1761
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
If the inflammation is

1762
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
because it is a positive feedback

1763
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
So it is also a curve like we see

1764
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
is a you inflamed

1765
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,000
how to say pro-inflammatory cytokine

1766
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
to a level

1767
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
it will go to another state

1768
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
it's like a bomb went off

1769
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Then you are beyond the critical point

1770
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
it goes to another state

1771
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
like an atomic bomb

1772
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
all the same

1773
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
This explosive growth

1774
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So it's like this positive feedback system

1775
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,540
like the words of sedkain

1776
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:04,100
It has the so-called Seidkaine Storm

1777
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:07,140
Or called Seph's Septic Shock

1778
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:08,600
blood disease

1779
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,600
Just worship blood disease until the end becomes Septic Shock

1780
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,500
just died

1781
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,200
just because there is no way

1782
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,600
the whole explosive growth

1783
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,900
So in other words, ROS is the same

1784
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:21,800
that's what i just said

1785
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,800
It's just old people getting older

1786
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,000
The ROS level is getting higher and higher

1787
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,200
After reaching a certain critical point

1788
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,000
it will be hard for you to recover

1789
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,100
It's the same as the old people are prone to get blood disease

1790
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:37,400
Just Septic Shock

1791
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,600
just died

1792
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,300
I don't know if I'm careful

1793
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,700
answering the question

1794
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:44,900
just these two are different

1795
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,100
Of course the same is ROS

1796
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:49,500
One is damage nuclear DNA

1797
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,300
One is damage mitochondrial DNA

1798
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,300
damage nuclear DNA造成carcinogenesis

1799
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,700
cause cancer

1800
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,800
damage damage

1801
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,500
Metocondor caused Aging

1802
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,620
Aging phenomenon caused by More ROS

1803
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:05,220
OK

1804
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,420
there are other questions

1805
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:16,460
sorry coach please

1806
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:17,160
that is

1807
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,920
The ROS just mentioned

1808
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,660
what is it

1809
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,800
it has produced

1810
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:28,160
That is to say, the universe world that we integrate

1811
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,200
we all know that

1812
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,200
The diversification of antibiotics starts with

1813
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,000
The so-called mold is against bacteria, right?

1814
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,160
it's competition

1815
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:36,900
same same thing

1816
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,800
In the plant kingdom there are also

1817
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,300
when we were different plants

1818
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,400
Assuming that when planted together

1819
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,100
When plants are of different species

1820
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,800
It emits toxins that allow other species

1821
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,700
it will be wiped out

1822
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,100
So if it is its own species

1823
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,300
when one's own species

1824
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,900
It's full of statistics

1825
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,300
it works by itself

1826
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,600
it produces ROS

1827
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:55,840
will it be one of its own

1828
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,000
Auto-reviewation

1829
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
self short touch

1830
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
would produce a result like this

1831
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Otherwise, in the middle of a limited time

1832
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
This so-called material of your surroundings

1833
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
no change

1834
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Your species has been called long-lived

1835
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
When the expansion has been

1836
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
What will be your interpretation at the end

1837
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
So this Mitrotoncide itself

1838
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Our speculators would want to change

1839
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
This Mitrotoncide itself this

1840
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
The anti-frustration part, thanks

1841
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
first of course

1842
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Nature

1843
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
don't want us to live long

1844
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
it doesn't make sense to keep us alive

1845
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
it must kill us

1846
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Life is fixed

1847
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
not too long

1848
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Too long is certainly not good for the species as a whole

1849
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
The second is to say that it is like ROS

1850
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
it this produces to itself

1851
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
is it bad or good

1852
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
because it is necessary

1853
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
it must produce

1854
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
you have acidative force for relation

1855
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
it will generate ROS

1856
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
ROS is required

1857
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
it's kind of weird

1858
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
And ROS is good for the human body at a low level

1859
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
it actually will

1860
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
ROS itself can produce Nerve 2

1861
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
what i just said

1862
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But Nerve must be low

1863
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Low ROSNerve 2 can produce Nerve 2

1864
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
If it is high, it is Toxic

1865
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
aging and cancer

1866
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
so it is already adapt

1867
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
In fact everything is the same

1868
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
it's your drug

1869
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
no matter how poisonous

1870
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Radiation or Chemical

1871
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Toxic these

1872
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
In high concentrations it is Toxic

1873
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
But the opposite is true at low concentrations

1874
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,000
like Arsonite

1875
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
like P2

1876
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
We all know it can cause longevity

1877
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
but it's deadly poisonous

1878
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
If you use the wrong dose, you will be poisoned to death

1879
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
OK

1880
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
There are many more like this

1881
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,400
It is very clear if you do experiments in Celegant

1882
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:08,400
It's all the so-called poisonous things that are now tested

1883
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,320
The result is longevity

1884
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,080
so what

1885
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,680
is a kind of stress

1886
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:17,200
This Stress will cause the increase of ROS

1887
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:19,880
But when these levels are low

1888
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,360
It is on the human body but it will have protection

1889
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,840
Nerve 2會be induced

1890
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,840
Just his Sile group I just mentioned

1891
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,280
As far as System group

1892
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,440
It is also oxidized by ROS

1893
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:37,360
So it is equal to self-regulate this ROS level

1894
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,360
OK

1895
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,680
My answer is not exactly

1896
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,000
Because you mentioned the influence of the environment on the outside

1897
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,600
I think that's more of a

1898
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,000
It is the evolutionary problem

1899
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,720
That is to say, if we want to live a long life

1900
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,240
is it good for something else

1901
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,560
In fact, it is impossible for us to live long

1902
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:00,000
Longevity, we have so many people now

1903
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,360
As it is often said, all infectious diseases are terrible for you

1904
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,240
you see the whole

1905
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:06,920
all this

1906
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,600
climate change

1907
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,160
or this

1908
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,160
infectious disease

1909
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,800
It's all because of the population

1910
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:16,400
man made problem

1911
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:16,800
ok

1912
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:17,920
although impossible

1913
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,200
too much

1914
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:19,920
ok

1915
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:20,640
so

1916
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,720
So we say to the whole society

1917
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,800
Should we always say

1918
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,560
the answer is no

1919
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,040
but for you personally

1920
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:28,720
do you want to say

1921
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,240
you might want to say

1922
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:30,920
ok

1923
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,480
then it will

1924
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,080
How far will the research go

1925
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,920
I think

1926
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:37,160
that is

1927
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,320
Assuming a rejuvenation study in the future

1928
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,000
is it possible to make this

1929
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,880
If it becomes a process

1930
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,760
That is to say, if you want to do it, we can do it

1931
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,760
here-rejuvenate

1932
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,840
And you can rejuvenate at any age

1933
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:54,160
just look at you

1934
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,280
Because it is now possible to seed mitochondria

1935
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,800
that is

1936
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:00,000
i think i have something i can't talk about

1937
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:07,760
That is to say, how to really do rejuvenation is that there are various methods to control

1938
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,320
So eventually I think it's ok

1939
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,880
That is to say, I may not see it in my lifetime

1940
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:18,360
I think 10 years and 20 years I think because now the progress is too fast too fast

1941
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:23,120
I think 10 years or 20 years, I think it may be about this rejuvenation research

1942
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,520
should know a lot better

1943
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,680
this can really be sytherpie

1944
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:29,800
Shouldn't be too difficult

1945
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,960
ok

1946
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,440
Thank you academician for your wonderful speech

1947
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,720
Well, I have one question, which is that I am more concerned about people's livelihood.

1948
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:42,600
it's in your title

1949
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,800
It's just that sometimes medicine is eaten as food

1950
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:48,560
So now I want to talk about how to eat

1951
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,440
Because there is a slide, I will talk about Rope or Clearing

1952
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:54,080
That's tantamount to saying it's life and death and chew

1953
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,600
Then I say now that I don't know how to bite

1954
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,400
What kind of mechanism can release this anside

1955
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,440
should be

1956
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,920
So this whole problem is going back to

1957
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,520
These are now broccoli you listed

1958
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,960
Not very familiar, there may be other foods

1959
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,520
Then we are if we make a healthy cook

1960
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,880
What should you suggest us

1961
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:14,480
how do you eat these things

1962
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,360
I don't make any comments on this

1963
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:20,480
i just research

1964
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,560
bring them out

1965
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,240
as a way to study his McCannism

1966
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:25,040
OK

1967
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,440
otherwise

1968
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:31,040
I can't make any recommendation

1969
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,600
What do you want to eat

1970
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,480
I can't comment on that matter

1971
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,040
right

1972
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:38,840
it means

1973
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:40,600
you can't cook

1974
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,360
here is

1975
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,040
right

1976
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:42,920
I know

1977
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:43,480
that is

1978
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:45,000
I'm not here to discuss this

1979
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:45,800
that is to say

1980
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,560
You do some combinations differently

1981
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:49,240
what can you mix it up

1982
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:49,960
Those ones

1983
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,440
those I am beyond me

1984
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,760
that is

1985
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:55,800
what's there now

1986
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,800
Because the mechanism is unclear for each

1987
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,040
like the chemical I mentioned

1988
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Like various things in Diabetic

1989
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
because it is compound

1990
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
it has different properties

1991
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
its pharmacokinetics

1992
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Pharmacodynamic is not the same

1993
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
So it is particularly effective for which tissue

1994
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,000
or which disease is particularly effective

1995
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
不是determined by the intrinsic mechanism

1996
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
是determined by the chemical

1997
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
By itself it has different solubility

1998
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
It can reach different places

1999
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
like something like

2000
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Compounds that are a bit like those of vitamin A

2001
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:39,000
It's like that tomato element is equal to the combination of two vitamin A

2002
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
and that

2003
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
There are a lot more

2004
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
like carotene

2005
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
are all

2006
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It has more vitamin A

2007
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
It's better for the eyes

2008
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
It is more hydrophobic

2009
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
it's to some special place

2010
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
So those study words

2011
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
is that each one is different

2012
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,240
hard study

2013
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,000
But I think Chinese medicine is more powerful

2014
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,140
they are

2015
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:10,900
they can recommend

2016
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:14,060
some prescriptions ah those I can't

2017
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:17,640
Because too many other mechanisms are in

2018
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,000
I just focus and talk

2019
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
What is their common mechanism

2020
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,140
OK common is ROS

2021
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:26,440
So they are health

2022
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:29,640
So generally speaking, there should be many, many activities

2023
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:34,340
Because ROS are the cause of various chronic diseases

2024
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:37,340
Most of the disease is chronic inflammation

2025
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:44,440
In fact, cancer and aging are actually chronic inflammatory diseases

2026
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,340
So what he has in common is this

2027
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:49,940
I use it to study this common point is that it can be

2028
01:33:49,940 --> 01:33:52,840
Then what do you say each one is going to do?

2029
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:56,040
then i think that very complicated very complicated thing

2030
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,440
yes

2031
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,840
there is one in front

2032
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,480
Did he raise his hand first?

2033
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:07,200
Hello academician

2034
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:15,240
In fact, my question is a bit similar to what the friend asked just now

2035
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:18,640
That's like ROS as you said

2036
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:22,200
He has his foundation and his effect in the body

2037
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:26,320
Especially when consuming some bacteria

2038
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,880
So the ROS system you just mentioned

2039
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,080
maybe at different times

2040
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,360
For example, before and after exercise

2041
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:36,960
or before and after infection

2042
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,840
He's on top of it at different times on different water polos

2043
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:44,520
He has a different amount of needs and a process of awareness

2044
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,600
So you synthesize through many different base transfers

2045
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,240
make this face more and more obvious

2046
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:52,600
more and more comprehensive

2047
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,320
So actually I was a little curious just now

2048
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,120
This hand is incompetent

2049
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,920
in the medicinal use of traditional Chinese medicine

2050
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,280
boiled or alcohol to soak

2051
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,200
would it be better

2052
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,680
Actually, I have thought about this question

2053
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,880
But when you mentioned

2054
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:13,040
The complexity of its recovery here

2055
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:17,080
So this part if there is a chance in the future

2056
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:18,800
We would also like to have this question

2057
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,040
actually hand in hand

2058
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,440
would like to use this thank you

2059
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,920
Yes, it is dissolved in alcohol

2060
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,840
OK that

2061
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,440
In fact, you also face many interesting things.

2062
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:29,320
you just asked a

2063
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:33,240
is like ROAS to

2064
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:34,120
for example

2065
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:37,800
Before Infection and Infection

2066
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,000
or before exercising

2067
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,160
it actually is different

2068
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:43,960
like now with COVID-19

2069
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,960
You use this ROA

2070
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,000
Use this Antioxidant

2071
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,880
when do you want to use it

2072
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:52,280
Of course the last patient died

2073
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,520
Death is mostly Septic shock

2074
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,400
That is, Septic shock is the last

2075
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,440
Septic shock is inflammation

2076
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,120
It is ROAS

2077
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,360
too much, it's inflammation

2078
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,160
ROX is inflammation, the two are almost equivalent

2079
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:10,320
So you use this anti-oxidant treatment

2080
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,840
Inflammation is okay

2081
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,360
but it's a serious inflammation

2082
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,840
That is to say, your ROX is the usage of anti-ROX

2083
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:22,160
may be very strong

2084
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:27,040
That is to say, that is to say, in your normal normal life

2085
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:31,680
We say use anti-oxidant to prevent viral infection

2086
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,440
Just avoid infection

2087
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:35,520
that's different

2088
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,080
The dosage is different

2089
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:38,880
I was a little worried at that time

2090
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,720
that is to say

2091
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:45,720
For example, you take a lot of these antioxidant drugs

2092
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:50,400
For this infection like COVID-19

2093
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:52,400
is protective

2094
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,280
or the opposite

2095
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,800
That probably means telling you when to use

2096
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,800
before infection and after infection

2097
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,240
It actually works differently

2098
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:03,240
OK

2099
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,000
So here's the problem

2100
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,800
that is

2101
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,000
Because it affects the email system will also

2102
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,800
So you were your email system before

2103
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:16,000
you better

2104
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,600
That can avoid infection

2105
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:19,240
words after infect

2106
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,800
you cause inflammation

2107
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,700
causing sepsis to die

2108
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,040
words at that time

2109
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,900
You want to reduce this inflammation

2110
01:37:25,900 --> 01:37:28,500
To use a lot of this ROS

2111
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,900
It is Anti-ROS

2112
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:30,900
The way

2113
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:33,200
So the dosage may vary

2114
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,200
No

2115
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,200
These are my talks

2116
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,000
Because of the talk I just want to talk about the mechanism

2117
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,500
is a common mechanism

2118
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,600
Finally I come to the issue of longevity

2119
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,300
This is one of the most interesting questions

2120
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:49,200
Is it possible to reverse longevity?

2121
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,100
is the most important thing

2122
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:55,200
do hitochronic parabellacus like this

2123
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:57,900
The biggest conclusion of this

2124
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,000
just can

2125
01:37:59,000 --> 01:37:59,800
OK

2126
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,120
As long as the blood together with the old and the young

2127
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,720
old becomes young

2128
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,320
young will grow old

2129
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,480
and vice versa

2130
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,680
So its stem cell is actually

2131
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,240
It's not that the purpose is not to make you young

2132
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,160
its purpose is to make you consistent

2133
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:19,400
That is, it uses bone marrow derived stem cell

2134
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:23,920
It is equivalent to survey your entire tissue resident stem cell

2135
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,840
make it age at the same time as old as it is

2136
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,400
So if you use young

2137
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,280
Then your tissue resident also becomes younger

2138
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:34,680
But if you use the old

2139
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,520
then you will grow old when you are young

2140
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,560
So it's not designed to keep you young

2141
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,360
but it can make you younger

2142
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:42,960
that's not what it's for

2143
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,200
its purpose is

2144
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:46,240
What are they called? Accordance

2145
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:47,840
that is, everyone at the same time

2146
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,760
It's your tissue that's aging together

2147
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,080
It's also a mystery

2148
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:56,080
Why do all tissues age at the same time

2149
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,840
The last two questions are

2150
01:38:59,360 --> 01:38:59,840
Professor Liang

2151
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,540
then the previous one

2152
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:07,940
This last one is your conclusion

2153
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,760
These things are against

2154
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:12,280
BAD HELP

2155
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,300
That

2156
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,620
what i want to ask is

2157
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:16,900
this

2158
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:23,040
It sounds like the energy water sold outside seems to help.

2159
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:25,600
that blockley we know

2160
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:28,160
then nothing helps

2161
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,460
In the middle, the one you mentioned

2162
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,280
Those two mice

2163
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,560
for

2164
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:39,160
How to use this experiment if you want anti-oxidation?

2165
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,200
is helpful

2166
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,240
OK is it a change of shoes?

2167
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:43,780
OK

2168
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:46,080
help with this therapy

2169
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:47,600
OK

2170
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:52,480
Of course, you will not use this Parabiosis method when doing treatment

2171
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,280
it's impossible

2172
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:58,880
So you use the Stem Cell with the Bomero derived Stem Cell

2173
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Probably most of them are progenitors

2174
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
HSPC

2175
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,000
like hematopoietic stem progenitor cell

2176
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
it is a mixture

2177
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Mostly I guess progenitor

2178
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
那the mithincamal stem cell

2179
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I guess too

2180
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
not a stem cell

2181
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Most are also progenitors

2182
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
So it should be called mithincamal stromal cells

2183
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
maybe better

2184
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
what did you ask

2185
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
OK OK

2186
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
how do you cure

2187
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
In fact, the treatment is known

2188
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
just say

2189
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
For example, we are now an old man

2190
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
There are various diseases of the elderly

2191
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
If we use the rejuvenation therapy

2192
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
what should we do

2193
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
OK what to do with it

2194
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
for example

2195
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
you just have to call it

2196
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
because the most important thing is the young mediacondria

2197
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
to rejuvenate first

2198
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Your bone marrow derived stem progenitor cells

2199
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
OK

2200
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
That means you have to

2201
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Compared with the current method, expectancy is used to learn

2202
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
these are comparisons

2203
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But your average person is like us, it is impossible to expect to learn

2204
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
We didn't have this concept at the time

2205
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
So we didn't stay to learn

2206
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
but you can learn from your child's expectations

2207
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
can also

2208
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
that is to say family

2209
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Can use

2210
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
or extremely different

2211
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
As long as it is human expectation

2212
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Possible Immune Response

2213
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
is not that big

2214
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
that is

2215
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
so maybe also

2216
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Match may have a way

2217
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
But of course it is better to use

2218
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
expectancy

2219
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Mr.Camel Stem Cell is just a method

2220
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
but there are many ways

2221
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
that is to say you at the same time

2222
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
like you stimulate

2223
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Metercondrial Quality Control

2224
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
You are like one of C

2225
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Young Metacondrial

2226
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
but you have thousands of

2227
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Old Metercondrial

2228
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Then you have to Stimulate

2229
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Quality Control Mechanism

2230
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
is to make Metaphobia

2231
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
remove the bad

2232
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
The way you punch in is scary

2233
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
this

2234
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
So there are various ways to do

2235
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
that is

2236
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Now is the time to do these experiments

2237
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
make sure there is no danger

2238
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
we talk theory

2239
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
didn't say anything

2240
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
What about other side effects

2241
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
ok

2242
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
It is possible to do it now

2243
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
just can work

2244
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Then worry about other things

2245
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
It will take a lot of time

2246
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Completely develop a protocol

2247
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Of course, everyone just hopes to develop a simple protocol

2248
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,000
can hit people directly

2249
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Just a few weeks to find out

2250
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
you can regermanate

2251
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
so

2252
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
is possible

2253
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I think it should be

2254
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
should be possible

2255
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
ok then our time is up

2256
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
but thank you

2257
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I have time to practice with a TV camera

2258
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
thank you all

2259
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Thanks

2260
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Thanks

2261
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,960
Thank you Liling for all the guests

2262
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:08,280
Please don't leave and forget to take your belongings

2263
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:11,200
If you want to fill out the questionnaire, you can go outside

2264
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,000
Use the QR Code to scan the code to access the Internet where there is an Internet connection

2265
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Thanks
