1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Central Concert Park

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Feast of Knowledge lecture begins

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We ask Vice President Peng Xuming to host for us

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Distinguished guests

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
thank you all for coming

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Participate in the Central Actor hosted

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Feast of knowledge every month

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
very honored today

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Please go to the actor of the speedless department

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to report

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
The interaction of this plant heritage with the environment

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,540
From seeing the sunrise

13
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,740
This physical strength is very attractive, right?

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,240
that last month

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,940
We invited Director Wu Junjie to speak about the typhoon

16
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,640
After coming, it will be a typhoon night

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,000
Today is still typhoon night

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,340
but also in the future

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,940
I hope it won't be too windy and rainy

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,500
bother everyone

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,580
but before we start

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,880
or let me briefly introduce

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,320
The experience of today's protagonist

24
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,880
Dr. Wu grew up in

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,920
Although Kelian has

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,380
But I still want to introduce

27
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,980
Grows in the Ganan Plains

28
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,880
So 1985

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,580
Graduated from Chiayi Lingzhong

30
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,280
Then 1989 and 1992

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,580
Department of Botany, National Taiwan University

32
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,480
At that time it was called the plant department

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,980
get a master's degree

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,600
Say yes, but now it's called the Department of Life Sciences

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,000
there are two masters

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,800
The same he was at UC Davis in California

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Later, I will share that I received a Ph.D. in 1997

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,100
Then did postdoctoral work at the University of California and the University of Stanley

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,600
Then the Academia Sinica came back in 2001 to start his academic career

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,300
Once it can be called a job office at that time

41
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,400
Now it is also renamed as the Institute of Biological Sciences

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
that is now a researcher

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,100
The daily schedule is the basic basic scientific research of the job

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,400
The main research topic is to get on this topic

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,900
How does Deng feel about the environment in this position?

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,000
this light message

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,400
How messages are transmitted in cells and other related topics

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
Regulatory Mechanisms of Gene Expression

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,720
lots of research

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,020
The results are published in internationally renowned journals

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,860
It has also won a number of affirmations from the domestic academic circles

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,320
Then he has rich enthusiasm to participate in basic scientific research

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,840
In addition to popular science knowledge delivered by the mass media

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,320
Actively cultivate high school students and college students

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,020
Features in our Academia Sinica

56
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,180
It is also because he has continued to participate in promoting

57
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,320
Including international postgraduate students and more

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,320
So is a very contacted researcher

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,220
let's applaud first

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,020
Welcome to Wu Suxin

61
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,020
Come give us this wonderful report

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,420
Thank you Vice President for your introduction

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,520
Welcome everyone good night and very welcome today on a stormy night

64
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,600
able to come here

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,160
Give me the opportunity to be able to spend an hour and a half in the next hour or so

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,560
Let me introduce the interaction between plants and the environment in my eyes

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,160
The interaction between plants and the environment covers a wide range of levels

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,920
So today I will explain to you the part I know better.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,560
That is an interaction between plants and the light of the external environment

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,760
good

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,600
what's next

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Because this topic is set from seeing the sunrise

73
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,600
So, I would like to introduce to you a little with a video about truth-telling photography.

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,000
Will I block the audience here?

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
If you just wave and ask me to go away

76
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,440
can be good

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:45,880
good

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,760
good

79
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,800
Well, to be honest, photography is basically to take a range of observation

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
and then at different times depending on how long this happened

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,280
after photography at different times

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,960
and play it in a fast way

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,240
This video is for you to see

84
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,220
After seeing a thousand flowers after sunrise

85
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,720
bloom after the sun

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,820
time of day

87
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,120
after noon

88
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,480
this flower will wither

89
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
we can watch it again

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,520
this is the flower

91
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,200
Then it was originally a darker purple in color

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,760
Then

93
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,320
As the structure of this calico unfolds slowly,

94
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
it will fade slowly

95
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
Then the life of this flower is only one day

96
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,000
the next day if you say

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,640
you guys have a chance to take a walk outside

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,940
Look at the thousands of flowers on the roadside

99
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,880
you can see a lot

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,240
Different flowers bloom every day

101
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
this is

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,240
Plants receive the message of light

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
I know it's daytime

104
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,980
Spread beautiful flowers throughout the day

105
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,420
In addition to interacting with the environment

106
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,780
Feel outside the light environment

107
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,720
In fact, plants are also different from many

108
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,360
Light the information inside to make some exchanges

109
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,200
For example in this

110
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,740
In the crocus plant it is often

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,980
It's naturally snowing inside

112
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,980
just in some colder places

113
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,740
it this blade

114
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,240
The part you see purple now is the part of the petal

115
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,380
the part of the petal

116
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,100
It has cells that are a little more medial

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,980
There are also slightly outer cells

118
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,340
the inner cell

119
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
When the temperature of light perception increases

120
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,240
It grows faster

121
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,340
The outer side will grow a little slower

122
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,780
so you can see

123
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,780
let's watch it again

124
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,700
you can see it in this

125
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,580
that side part

126
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,380
due to light

127
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,640
accept temperature changes

128
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,740
it grows faster

129
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,600
so it blooms

130
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,580
beautiful open

131
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,740
It is when the temperature rises during the day

132
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,480
it feels some temperature changes

133
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,380
Let out beautiful flowers again

134
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,380
So I want to use these two

135
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,900
real photography videos

136
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,040
Let everyone feel the beauty of plants

137
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,900
That's because when it comes to plants

138
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,400
i think also

139
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,240
Those two videos just now were

140
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,440
I from this Planche Emotion

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,760
Some videos of my job, I think maybe some teachers or students here might be interested

142
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,600
You can also go to this website to participate, it is also a

143
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,200
Full of hot teachers inside Indiana University

144
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,960
It collects some animations and some videos of a lot of positions in motion

145
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,440
It can be used as a reference for everyone to observe the beautiful faces of various jobs

146
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,360
You can also go to this site to search

147
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Before introducing the interaction with the environment that we will talk about today

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,820
I would like to welcome your time to introduce

149
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,480
My favorite research material and why

150
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,640
In all the research topics of so many life sciences

151
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,820
Why Study Botany

152
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,640
Botany is like you can see that we are on the road every day

153
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Or we can appreciate it in our surrounding environment

154
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
There is so much diversity and so beautiful

155
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,840
Well, of course this is the evolutionary part.

156
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,360
It also includes fruits, vegetables, etc. that we often eat

157
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,480
These are either seeds or antiquities these are plants

158
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
the plant it also has

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,440
There is a lot of biological diversity

160
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,600
For example, starting from Chlorella

161
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Green algae slowly evolve in the water

162
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,640
After climbing onto land

163
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,040
There are some dangerous plants

164
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,160
some terrestrial plants

165
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,840
and then slowly evolved to the surrounding tube tree plants

166
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,360
get planted

167
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,960
There are flowering plants, snail plants, snail plants, etc.

168
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,680
So you can imagine that in this creature

169
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,760
An evolutionary process in the plant kingdom

170
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,440
It actually covers a lot

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,160
the environment it needs to adapt to

172
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,840
Climb from water to land

173
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,920
from dwarf ground plants

174
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,000
Peritube trees

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
and then until the planting starts

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,200
The use of planting has a relatively dry

177
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,360
can be stored to distribute

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,480
During these processes, plants continue to evolve

179
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,640
But in the process of evolution

180
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,200
have been collecting some abilities

181
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,560
adapt the plant to

182
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,400
various environments

183
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,600
in the process of evolution

184
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,120
The natural world is constantly changing

185
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,280
The climate has also been changing

186
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Plants must also be very full

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,700
to adapt to changes in nature

188
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,400
After the plant has taken root and sprouted

189
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
It must stay in this place to complete its life

190
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,400
So plants have to have a lot of different strategies

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,000
To detect some subtle changes in the external environment

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What to do with these changing plants

193
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
what am i going to do

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and then be able to adjust themselves to the changes that best suit the environment

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is a great feature of the plant

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In addition, the survival of human beings, of course, also depends on the production of plants.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
For example, a very simple plant in photosynthesis

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,500
Fish that fix carbon dioxide to make sugar

199
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
it also releases oxygen

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,500
This oxygen is what we humans breathe

201
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
So this is also the presence of plants that we have to rely on

202
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,000
to be able to survive

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Plants are also primary producers

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
see a special font

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
making teacher's products

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Feel sorry

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
Plants are primary producers

208
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,000
I should have asked my daughter to help me change my size yesterday

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
So plants are primary producers

210
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,500
It plays the role of converting the energy of light into chemical energy

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
present in sugar

212
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,320
which can then be indirectly converted to

213
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,000
some other human needs

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,400
sources of energy, nutrients, etc.

215
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,120
So plants are also the role of semi-wild primary producers

216
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,240
In addition, plants contain many

217
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
Very rich in natural metabolites

218
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
some will talk about later

219
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,200
maybe some

220
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
Possible future source of new drugs

221
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,960
or some antioxidants

222
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
what we often eat now

223
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,000
Some nutritional supplements, etc.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
So these are often derived from

225
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,480
Some stimulating metabolites produced by plants

226
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
or natural compounds

227
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,680
That

228
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,080
even in Taiwan

229
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,840
People's livelihood is rich

230
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,880
Then we often sometimes

231
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,320
can't feel

232
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,280
is what we need in life is in fact

233
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,560
very sufficient

234
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,760
So we sometimes feel like saying

235
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,320
maybe some elite modified crops

236
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,680
We worry about it endangering our health

237
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,200
etc.

238
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,960
But in fact this

239
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,920
Let me share with you my personal opinion

240
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,800
It is the existence of this elite modified crop

241
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,080
sometimes it's not

242
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
Maybe not

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,400
and the life of this rich man

244
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,840
it may be an option to choose

245
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,360
But for many other places in the world

246
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,480
source of some food

247
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,520
it may not be an option

248
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,480
There are also a lot of malnourished children over there

249
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,600
It needs some high nutritional value crops

250
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,640
For example, these high nutritional value crops

251
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
For example, it can contain relatively high folic acid

252
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,960
or Vitamin A

253
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,440
or some trace necessary

254
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,360
Metal elements such as new or iron, etc.

255
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,040
Then there are these nutrient-modified crops

256
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,960
within these practical processes

257
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,480
help these more remote areas

258
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,040
Or children or adults in needy areas

259
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,600
get enough nutrition

260
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
can improve some

261
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,200
some of the life they face

262
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
basic question

263
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Then maybe it's not something we need to think about every day

264
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,360
or problems faced

265
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,800
But still many places in the world

266
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,880
Many people face daily

267
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,680
A situation that needs to be resolved and needs to be combated

268
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,640
even for us

269
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,000
at present

270
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Maybe not, but the environment changes

271
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,280
Everything is actually changing at an accelerated pace

272
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,760
So for many botanists

273
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,360
Improvements that allow food crops to yield better

274
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,960
Ability to resist the environment

275
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,080
Or some that can produce more high nutritional value

276
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,720
Antiquities or products of some fruits and vegetables

277
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,760
It's still a job that requires continuous effort.

278
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,680
Because there's a chance it's not our problem today

279
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,080
Then the future may also be our problem

280
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,360
So in my mind

281
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
It's a constant work

282
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
So in the study of plants

283
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
There is also a large portion

284
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,600
It is betting on things like improving crops

285
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,240
Or find a way to give us a better

286
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,120
An effort on the source of the diet

287
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
what's next

288
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
These are just a few examples

289
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,360
For example, we just talked about some

290
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,240
Foods high in vitamin A, such as golden rice

291
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,320
You can see us this is the white rice we usually eat

292
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,720
That's rich in vitamin A

293
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,520
so it looks a little golden

294
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,960
That's why it's called golden rice

295
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,000
Then there is some water

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Other species have been modified

297
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
So it has a higher iron content

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,520
For example, it is easier to absorb the environment

299
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,240
Trace amounts of medium metals Necessary metallic iron

300
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,320
So let encourage the iron content in it will be relatively high

301
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,520
So let a lot of iron deficiency symptoms will produce some physical diseases

302
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,920
can also get some relief from using enigmas like this

303
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,520
In addition, antioxidants are also a matter of great concern to everyone now.

304
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,920
That is to say, there are more free machines in the body

305
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,880
May attack some macromolecules in cells

306
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,680
It will cause some damage or death of cells

307
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,240
At this time may add some

308
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,880
For example, like Q10 or like Huaqing tree, etc.

309
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,200
some supplements that can also have antioxidants

310
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,240
In fact, fruits and vegetables are a good natural source of antioxidant supplements

311
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Here you see something that looks like an eggplant

312
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,920
it's not eggplant it's tomato

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,120
It just has a relatively high amount of performance

314
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,200
some pigments, these pigments are an antioxidant

315
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,100
Because of the high amount of pigment produced

316
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,000
So let this tomato grow a bit like a small round eggplant

317
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,900
So it's a tomato full of antioxidants

318
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,100
Well those are just some examples

319
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,400
tell us again if some botanists

320
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,500
Or some researchers engaged in agricultural production

321
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Some of the contributions he hopes to make

322
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,900
In this respect in the study of botany

323
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,500
able to contribute

324
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,100
Then I think of course the obvious ones are the plants

325
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,800
Not just a source of food

326
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,300
For example, we just talked about some

327
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,500
Can provide some high nutritional sub-value crops

328
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,800
crop products etc.

329
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,400
In addition, it also contains a lot of ingredients with new drugs developed

330
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,600
For example, some anticancer drugs

331
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,500
or some cancer drugs

332
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,400
Or there are a lot of Chinese herbal medicines

333
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
Separate many components

334
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,000
In fact, it is a source of opportunity for the development of new drugs

335
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,500
In addition, plants are rich in cellulose

336
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,000
of course it is

337
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Has long been used as a source for paper makers and paper products

338
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,600
In addition, what is now called renewable energy or reproductive energy

339
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,100
From the plant kingdom can provide some

340
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,600
renewable is a can

341
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,700
sustainable source of renewable energy

342
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,700
These are some simple basics of some plants

343
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,500
The study of botany is not just about how plants grow and how they are planted

344
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,300
How and when will it bloom?

345
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,000
even we'll talk about it later

346
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,300
In fact, there are more possibilities

347
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,700
I hope there may be some high school students and college students or some parents here

348
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,400
In fact, consider

349
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,900
In the biological sciences, it may be considered to have a better understanding of botany

350
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,500
Plants also have a very special

351
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,100
It is also impossible for animals to reach

352
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,500
It's a very special feature

353
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,400
That is to say it has a omnipotence

354
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,000
All omnipotence means

355
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,960
Usually it is difficult for us to cut off a hand

356
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,940
Then grow a new innumerable

357
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,240
A little difficult

358
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
But for plants

359
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,280
Often most of the living cells in his body

360
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,880
can be removed separately

361
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,720
After being cultured, it becomes a cell mass

362
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,080
After this cell mass has been cultured with a specific ratio of hormones

363
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,760
It is capable of developing into an independent spider

364
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,160
So it means that inside the cell

365
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,680
Most of the cells in the plant

366
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,160
Even though it has fully differentiated into

367
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,080
sperm cells leaf cells flower cells root cells

368
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,480
It still has that ability and that memory

369
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,040
can be influenced by the environment

370
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,760
Or an inducement of your external nutrient cultivation machine

371
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,520
able to bring the cell back to its original

372
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,240
as a clone

373
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,640
Or the so-called stem cells in animals

374
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,960
such an ability

375
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,720
Able to turn itself back into a new spider

376
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,880
Then this is I think this time in plant research is also a

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
very unique

378
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
a characteristic of plants

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
totipotency

380
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
what's next

381
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Because the part I want to introduce to you today

382
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The Arab world is often used as an example

383
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So I also want to use this picture to introduce this to you

384
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Thoughts that look unexpected on the side of the road

385
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But in our hearts it's great

386
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
A source of material for this study

387
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
its name is arabian circles

388
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The Arab world may be related to its scientific name

389
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is Rabidopsisifeliana

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It is a type of dicotyledonous plant

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
that's what it looks like

392
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's usually when we're on the side of the road

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
often seen

394
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
there may be no way to see

395
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
exactly the same as this

396
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because its original growth pair is not in Taiwan

397
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
but this is what it looks like in the lab

398
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It has very cute little white flowers

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
four white petals

400
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
with four two pieces

401
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Then there are six bear stamens and a magnetic stamen inside

402
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's the structure of its calico

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So maybe you are not familiar with the Arab world

404
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,120
But I want to talk about broccoli, white cauliflower, bok choy

405
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,960
Vegetables that are common on these tables

406
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,440
Maybe everyone is familiar with it

407
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,160
These vegetables are similar to the Arab world

408
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,600
are cruciferous plants

409
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
they are cousins

410
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,720
all in the same

411
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,160
They also have many similar characteristics

412
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,560
including the sequence of his genes

413
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,840
The way genes are arranged in the nucleus

414
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,960
has its very similar place

415
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,760
So the Arab world like this

416
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
to be used as research material

417
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,920
In fact, it can be used as a good springboard

418
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,680
For these varieties of some of our common vegetables

419
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,640
and its application

420
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,520
or possible future modifications

421
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,800
can have a good foundation

422
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,880
Use this Arab world for research

423
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,360
it has many benefits

424
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,480
For example, it grows for a short time

425
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,560
It takes about two or three months to complete a life cycle

426
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,040
its spider is small

427
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,240
More suitable for cultivation in the laboratory

428
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,760
It also produces a lot of seeds

429
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,040
It is more convenient to do some genetics in the laboratory

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Write cell blood in other aspects

431
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,280
or biochemistry

432
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,160
Research related to molecular biology

433
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,400
That's an Arabian sword

434
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,280
can see him

435
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,520
In my eyes are lovely little white flowers

436
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
And then it's his

437
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,960
Looking down from the top there is a

438
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,480
structure resembling whorled leaves

439
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,720
this is arabic sword

440
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,160
That's because wait a minute

441
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,680
may see some videos

442
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,080
pertaining to individual plants

443
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,760
That is, what does a plant seedling look like

444
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,320
I believe that everyone may be like me

445
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
will start from elementary school

446
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Put toilet paper in a small box

447
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,320
Then the teacher will ask us to go home and plant mung beans

448
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
or red beans

449
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,600
that's all that

450
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,320
I used to be taught by my mother to water

451
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Then my retribution is

452
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,480
My daughter's water is what I taught

453
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,560
So I think everyone has gone through this

454
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,960
that's why i didn't understand

455
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,400
Then I don't know everyone at that time

456
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,320
Besides teaching water or looking at this seed

457
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,040
This process of germination is observed

458
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,920
Then teach the teacher's homework

459
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,880
Have you ever looked at it carefully?

460
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,080
what do these plants look like

461
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,100
what does it look like

462
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,040
So let's briefly review today

463
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,480
what does this plant look like

464
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,040
Then because of this wait will follow

465
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,200
some videos you'll see

466
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,740
It has something to do with the shape of the plant

467
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,900
So let's take a moment to look at

468
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,100
Then in the meantime I'll do a little bit of a comparison

469
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,400
What are the differences between animals and plants

470
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
And then I think you've sort of figured out

471
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,800
my speech is very fast

472
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,600
then i usually talk about

473
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,100
I think when I say happy things

474
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,000
will speak a little faster

475
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,100
So please don't remind me of this

476
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,900
slow down or say

477
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,500
I just feel like saying it again when I need it

478
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,900
I didn't know you told me about the process of measuring

479
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Just raise your hand a little bit to remind me

480
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,000
then we can

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,500
To explain is to discuss

482
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,300
then we can go on

483
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,000
then this is

484
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,100
Embryo development in the Arabian kingdom of Mosz

485
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,500
with it there will be in the end

486
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
a form of seedling

487
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,100
That plant is embryonic development

488
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,800
Furthermore, the development of direct motion is the same as that of plants

489
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,500
After the sperm and egg unite

490
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
an embryo is formed

491
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,900
inside the embryo

492
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
The embryo of the plant is planted inside

493
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,160
But in the plant it will start to do the initial development

494
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,400
What did you develop into?

495
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,560
developed to resemble a natural lesion

496
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,760
slightly bigger than this

497
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
The process starts here

498
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,360
That is, there is a tail blowing under it

499
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,600
This will naturally degenerate

500
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,760
There is a spherical structure on it

501
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,920
will start

502
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,560
like cutting a watermelon

503
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,600
Cut a knife and split from this side

504
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,400
Divide once more to double the number of cells

505
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,560
or cut once from this side

506
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,200
Divide that way and double the number of cells again

507
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,960
so you'll see it

508
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,040
Like cutting and scraping, after re-cutting

509
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,800
You slowly start to grow more and more cells

510
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,840
Those cells are slowly growing up

511
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,200
will start to divide into different parts

512
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,040
Different parts will do different things in the future

513
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,240
For example, here is the color

514
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,800
The green part will grow longer in the future

515
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,600
The structure here

516
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
Seeing this here, everyone may start to be a little familiar

517
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Because I saw a little belly seedling

518
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
Then these are the two cotyledons of Xiaodu seedlings

519
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,040
It's the first pair of leaves to grow

520
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,440
These two pairs of cotyledons

521
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,000
Then this part may become the essence of plants in the future.

522
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,960
For example, Xianpixian is immediately the trunk of a tree

523
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
That's where the bean sprouts eat that body part

524
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Then the bottom part is where the roots will grow later.

525
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,900
So it's basically a small plant

526
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Miniature Leaf Seedling Embryo Seed

527
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
it looks like this

528
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,400
What about after it grows up, after it sprouts, after its roots protrude?

529
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,900
The gold cloth will also lengthen and the plant leaves will start to tilt up

530
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
will then open

531
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,900
So basically, the shape of the leaf seedling is the root

532
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,400
then gold cloth then leaves

533
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
There is another very interesting place in the middle

534
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
the place painted red

535
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
this place

536
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
this place is plant

537
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Plants are very different from animals that is to say

538
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,400
In the embryo it grows like this

539
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
It stops and waits for germination before doing the next thing

540
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
But people are different, right?

541
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
People grow up before they are born

542
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
It's a face with a tile face, and the horns of the hair have grown back

543
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
But without plants, plants grow like this

544
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
So let's say we're talking about a lotus flower

545
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
We did not see a single lotus in the seeds

546
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Then

547
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,700
All of them have grown into the same shape

548
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
it grows here

549
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
it's stopped

550
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,900
Then the wait is to say

551
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
this growing point

552
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,600
so-called avatars

553
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,300
or growth point

554
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,400
the growth point

555
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
the location of the so-called stem cells

556
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,500
but stem cells

557
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,900
Are you looking for me?

558
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,000
What about the stem cells?

559
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,900
is after

560
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,100
stimulated by the environment

561
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,000
after it grows

562
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,900
It's going to do all the other roots

563
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,200
new karma

564
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,300
will bloom later

565
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,200
when there will be results

566
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,500
or to produce seeds

567
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
from these stem cells

568
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,300
so it was not decided at that time

569
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,800
The seed has not been decided yet

570
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,300
Then the environment tells it

571
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,500
when will it grow

572
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,400
what will it look like

573
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,900
much longer

574
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,000
So this is also related to animals

575
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,200
very different place

576
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
then we know now

577
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
this basic form

578
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,700
we can see the next one

579
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,400
What about the next one?

580
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,900
we're going to take a look

581
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,100
i remember seedlings

582
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,700
The way it grows under the light

583
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,300
So what we see now is

584
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,200
a local

585
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,600
Then a small seedling will emerge from inside

586
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
What about that little seedling?

587
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
I just introduced to you

588
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This paper leaf and this extension of this gold cloth

589
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
we can take a look

590
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What you can see here is

591
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So here's a cute little seedling highlighting the chart

592
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Then these two are paper leaves

593
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
This is the gold cloth, the gold cloth is extending

594
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Then Paper Leaf went to look for it in the animation

595
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
where is the light where is the light

596
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
when i want i want this paper leaf

597
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Where can I hold it?

598
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
in what direction wait

599
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
that in this process

600
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
everyone can see it

601
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
A piece of paper is also slowly, and the leaves of the paper are gradually getting bigger

602
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Then it slowly turns green

603
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So after the light shines at this time

604
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Start the process of turning green

605
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It means that the chloroplasts in the cells start to develop

606
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
After the chloroplast develops, there are

607
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
after chloroplast

608
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
it can photosynthesize

609
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
carry out photosynthesis

610
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
it can start making starches, sugars

611
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
began to perform his role as a primary producer

612
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So that is

613
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I think the condition of the seedlings to germinate under the light

614
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What about the seedlings?

615
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Then you can see this little paper leaf just now

616
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
watch the light go round and round

617
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,460
I also find this interesting

618
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,860
This is a sunflower seedling

619
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,640
And what about these poor sunflower seedlings?

620
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,600
Why is he so like that five-year-old boy

621
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,240
just grinning

622
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,840
just keep moving

623
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,440
Is it because of these poor sunflower seedlings

624
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,240
grow in a low light situation

625
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,600
because of low light

626
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,960
So I don't know if everyone will be like me

627
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,160
I have some experience

628
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,560
Even though I study plants

629
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,360
so the only thing i can grow is my plant

630
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,960
It is the material of my experiment

631
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,760
So I will often put my plants in the comparison

632
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,960
dark place

633
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
So the plant will grow

634
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,160
Therefore, the soil grows rapidly in terms of his progress

635
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,760
That native has a big shortcoming

636
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,560
It's just that he won't be able to support him at first

637
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,760
When the leaves grow, he will fall down

638
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,560
That said, at home you have some plants that look

639
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,760
looks different from fancy

640
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
why is fancy so small yours is so big

641
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
then please give him more sunshine

642
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,960
So these plants

643
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,800
because it is placed under relatively low light conditions

644
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,200
So he poked his head around and kept looking

645
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,360
where is there more sun

646
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,640
how much sunshine can go

647
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,200
Except he was in the process of searching

648
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,560
You can also see that he has been growing this golden cloth structure

649
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,600
This is the long-term process I just talked about

650
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,200
His golden cloth is excessively extended

651
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
so

652
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
The search for the head is that the head is too heavy

653
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,320
so there is no way to compound

654
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,920
he'll start falling

655
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,640
Overwhelmed

656
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,200
So this is also a

657
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,760
An example where light is important for plants

658
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Why

659
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,560
he needs to find him

660
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,660
That

661
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,480
The next thing we will talk about is

662
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
Except we were just in low light

663
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,360
Then see the process of seed germination

664
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,620
Then I want to give a simple example

665
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,920
just to let everyone understand

666
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,960
light on plant growth

667
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,420
where is its importance

668
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,160
Then the simplest comparison is

669
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,080
germinate the seeds in the dark

670
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,960
Germinate in the light

671
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,560
then look at

672
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,880
Let's see what's the difference in their appearance

673
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,060
then let's go first

674
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,320
After a little concept

675
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,520
let's talk a little more

676
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,880
Then how to use this

677
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,160
Then this is the right seedling of sunflower sprouting in the dark

678
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,860
Germinate in the light

679
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,120
If you germinate in the dark, it depends on how big its head is.

680
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,200
It's just in the dark it won't be affected

681
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,040
The crystal cloth is continuously extended

682
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,480
On the other hand, in

683
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,200
The right seedling of this sunflower grew under the light

684
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,320
you can see it

685
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,840
Here its leaves begin to open

686
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,580
The extension of its lower shaft does not

687
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,520
That is, the extension of the crystal cloth is not so obvious

688
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,400
Then this part you can see it this

689
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
Part of the crystal cloth of the leaves is not opened at all

690
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,320
right

691
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,920
It's where the two leaves wrap together

692
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,120
it just has a tick

693
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
Next time you go to the vegetable market to see bean pepper dishes

694
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,960
I'll see more in just a few moments

695
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,760
it will have a tick in there

696
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,080
Hook it there so the two leaves are also put together

697
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,640
And what remains together is a very

698
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,240
It is an important protection measure for plants

699
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,880
that is

700
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,320
Remember what I just said about the stem cells that grow the electric plants?

701
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,720
to grow all the leaves

702
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,640
the place that gave me ten seeds

703
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,480
That place is wrapped in the middle of the two leaves

704
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,160
so you can think

705
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,700
I imagine a plant moulting in the dark

706
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,640
When it wants to break through the limit of the soil, when it is about to rise

707
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,840
It will definitely not want to keep rubbing it so important with the cells and the soil

708
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,960
and then maybe some damage, right?

709
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,840
So the ideal way is to wrap it in the leaves

710
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,540
Then use this curved cell to withstand

711
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,700
Gold cells withstand

712
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,080
jack it up until after it sees the graph

713
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,720
It floats when it sees the sun

714
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,800
Then the two leaves will open

715
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,960
This is what we just saw on the right

716
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,800
This section you can see it this

717
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,320
this crooked place opens up

718
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,360
The leaves are opened

719
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,960
Then this time is a place to grow

720
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,120
In fact, in the middle of the two leaves

721
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,560
At this time it receives the light message

722
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,760
It knows that my environment is right now

723
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I can start doing what I'm going to do with my life

724
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,160
then we saw

725
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
right side of arabian border

726
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,120
Right side of assortment of different plants

727
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,000
in the light

728
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,540
What grows in the dark

729
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,860
when growing in darkness

730
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,420
It's just a very long groove with this lower shaft

731
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,460
then there are two

732
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,740
There is this curved hook

733
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,540
The so-called ticked places

734
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,440
Then there are two sides practicing

735
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,600
small and yellow

736
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,380
The karmic body has not yet begun to develop

737
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,180
Has not yet started photosynthesis

738
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,480
What about the plants that grow under the light?

739
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,040
On the other hand, it will make relatively short progress

740
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,320
Then there is the open practice

741
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,140
Then the growth point in the middle also starts

742
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,180
Know I'm in the right place to start

743
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,980
Things that will grow leaves in the future

744
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,560
So basically speaking, there are probably two important points

745
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,140
One is that the extension speed of the so-called lower shaft will slow down under the light

746
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,180
So it doesn't have to be extended that much

747
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,220
It's enough to extend that much

748
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,520
what we just said is harmless

749
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,800
what about the other

750
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,560
that is

751
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,860
This career also develops karmic experience and begins to develop

752
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,420
Then this top avatar organization also began to have the ability

753
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,960
make new leaves

754
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,500
Then this is the most basic

755
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,600
It is the difference in the development of plants under light and non-light

756
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,900
Although we said later, wait a minute, we will

757
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,760
study with many concepts like this

758
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,080
that biologists would want to know

759
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,640
Well, how do my plants know that the light is coming

760
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,480
How do I know I'm sticking out

761
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,240
how do i know when i'm going to do these things

762
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,440
So according to this observation of nature

763
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,800
Knowing the difference between the two forms

764
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,520
This can be used as a basis

765
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
Let the botanists study

766
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,720
Ok, let me compare the differences between the two.

767
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,560
where and how the difference arises

768
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,800
What if I don't look so good

769
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,200
I look a little white

770
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,720
I look a bit my career is not open

771
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,840
what the hell happened

772
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,720
Then by exploring the question

773
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,880
to understand how plants feel

774
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,080
A change in ambient light

775
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
good

776
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,720
The change of external light is also very complicated.

777
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,440
This is a

778
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,800
A spectrum from ultraviolet to visible light

779
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,760
The ultraviolet light is about 300 nm or below

780
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,080
In fact, visible light is about 400 to 800

781
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,320
From which, red, orange, yellow, green, and blue electrons can be separated

782
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,040
Then what

783
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,800
That is, blue light has a shorter wavelength

784
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,600
then green, then red, then red

785
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,300
So it naturally has so many shades of different colors

786
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,200
And the morning is different from the afternoon

787
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
when you are at noon and when you are in the evening

788
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,500
The ratio of the light is not the same

789
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,100
So how do plants know what time it is?

790
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,500
so how do i know it's morning

791
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,000
Then it's evening

792
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
what time is my light

793
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,300
what am i going to do

794
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,500
So what about plants

795
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,200
after receiving the light

796
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
it can do many things

797
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,600
Let me tell you what plants can do

798
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,700
Then I'll introduce you later

799
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,200
Why do plants do these things

800
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,400
Here, light affects the life of the plant

801
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,800
In fact, I have been doing light since I was studying for a Ph.D.

802
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,300
The bad light in biological research has also affected my life

803
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,600
So where does this light-affecting plant doctor begin?

804
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,200
Start with the middle bud

805
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,500
So it’s pretty low level in the chart

806
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,300
He receives little light to stimulate his germinated seeds

807
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,100
often useful

808
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Some troubles above germination

809
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Light guides plant germination

810
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
We've just seen a lot of lighted and unlit times

811
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the difference in its external form

812
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
just this crooked one

813
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
GoGo

814
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
when it's in the soil

815
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Protect this apex clone

816
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
After shining the light, there are two open words

817
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
This so-called de-whitening phenomenon

818
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
In addition, in the natural world, it is like a white race, right?

819
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Sometimes you'll see plants growing under shade

820
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
it's my plant

821
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Two older brothers and a younger brother grow up in the middle

822
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
This little brother said yes

823
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't get enough sunlight

824
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's very bad for my growth, isn't it?

825
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
but it doesn't matter

826
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
it can feel

827
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
it is now at a disadvantage

828
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Not because its siblings are all big

829
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
it feels oppressive

830
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Rather, it feels the tension between the two big brothers

831
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The light environment is different

832
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
The quality of light varies

833
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Its light is far more yellow

834
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So this little plant feels far yellow

835
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,300
In the case of more red light

836
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,720
He will tell himself to work hard to grow up

837
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,520
This is the extension of Jinmu will be faster

838
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,240
faster results

839
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,200
He'll grow faster than his two big brothers

840
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,480
faster than his two older brothers

841
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,080
Then he has a chance to stand out

842
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,280
This so-called shade or tree layer

843
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,040
It is more convenient for him to grow taller

844
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,360
receive light for photosynthesis

845
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,200
sustain his own growth

846
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,680
This is also a feeling of light quality

847
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
wait a minute let's talk about this

848
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,120
Some regulation of light on plants

849
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,520
Another obvious

850
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,800
is also

851
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,040
Turns out I was reading my daughter's

852
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,160
middle school biology textbook

853
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,800
I also started to read about photophobia

854
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,880
suddenly feel so kind

855
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,320
I feel that I have let down my teacher a little bit.

856
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,240
not so deep experience

857
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,120
So I always make my daughter

858
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,320
Obligation to teach her to listen to this

859
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,440
She just isn't always interested

860
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,640
So one of them I saw in her textbook

861
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,320
photogenic

862
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,280
The photonity is, for example,

863
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,200
the light comes from here

864
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,280
Then I use it to grow long

865
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,880
light came

866
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,960
Is to follow the angle of light, follow the direction of light, this is phase

867
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
It's mostly a blu-ray reaction

868
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,720
In addition, not only plants can move, we just saw some videos of many plants moving

869
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,160
In addition to the movement of plants, the things inside the cells also move

870
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,680
Another great feature of plant cells is that there are karma in plant cells

871
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:24,280
Yeshiti is a location for making photosynthesis to produce starch and soup

872
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,800
Inside the cell is a so-called air-filled place

873
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,040
This karmic body has many

874
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,080
The chloroplast actually moves around inside the cell

875
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,480
How to move and what direction to move are also controlled according to the light

876
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,440
wait a minute let's talk

877
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,680
In addition, plant cells also have a very special structure called stomata

878
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:49,080
Just like the nose, the back of each leaf on the top of the leaf

879
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,760
It has a structure with many pores

880
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,920
The structure of this stomata is mainly when it opens

881
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,680
There is a communication channel in the leaves of plants with the outside world.

882
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,080
This exchange pipe can let the gas in as well

883
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,100
let the gas out

884
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
The incoming gas is carbon dioxide

885
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,600
Can carry out photosynthesis

886
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,400
Plants fix carbon dioxide to produce sugars

887
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,600
At the same time, the oxygen released in this process is also

888
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,100
released into the atmosphere

889
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Workers use

890
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,300
In addition to gas exchange

891
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,700
and some water vapor release

892
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,000
For example, plants absorb water

893
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,200
sucked too much

894
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,300
It's the way the existing water vapor evaporates

895
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,900
released from the pores

896
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,700
For the water cycle

897
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,600
it's also important

898
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,400
such as water

899
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,800
rain falls into the soil

900
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
Then it drains and then the plant roots absorb it

901
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,300
evapotranspiration through the stomata of leaves

902
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,300
back into the atmosphere

903
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,200
This also completes a water cycle

904
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,300
Therefore, the opening and closing of stomata are also regulated by light.

905
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300
Another wait will be the last

906
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,100
it will take a while

907
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,300
Let me introduce you to the so-called biological clock

908
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,200
Light also controls plant biological clocks

909
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,400
let the plants know

910
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,000
chicken nugget blood is also falling

911
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Its daybreak

912
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,500
8:00 pm

913
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,000
the heat fell

914
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,700
it's time to sleep

915
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,100
So it also controls the plant biological clock

916
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,000
This also controls the flowering time of some plants

917
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,400
until the final opening

918
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,840
annual plants at this time

919
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,240
The leaves begin to age

920
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,040
So from birth

921
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,280
From germination to plant aging

922
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,120
Each step is regulated by light information

923
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,040
I hope to have a chance to introduce you

924
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,080
Among them, I think the part with more typical characteristics

925
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,680
Plants see these external light environments

926
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
how did you see it

927
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,960
In fact, after decades of research by scientists

928
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,480
It turns out it's really easy

929
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,320
Although plants do not have eyes that we can see

930
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,120
but it has some special proteins

931
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,160
These proteins are inside the cell

932
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,080
act as the eyes of the plant

933
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,200
Some properties of the light environment outside can be seen

934
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,920
For example, we just talked about

935
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,360
From UV light to blue light

936
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,040
Green light, red light, far red light, etc.

937
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,160
This is distributed across the spectrum of visible light

938
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,200
the ultraviolet part

939
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,240
there's a protein called ultraviolet light

940
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
This was not discovered until last year

941
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,520
body with ultraviolet light

942
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,920
The other body of blue light

943
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,720
silver flower

944
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
or phototropin

945
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
There is also the Red Light Garden

946
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The receptor for red light is called luciferin

947
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
i want these names

948
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Basically it doesn't mean that much

949
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
for most

950
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's the part I need to know

951
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
it is a rate of fire

952
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
it is a protein

953
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Usually this protein

954
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
added one more

955
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
so-called plankton

956
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
or some compounds

957
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
it will follow this protein

958
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
by shared driving

959
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
tightly together

960
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
these compounds

961
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
it has many

962
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
ring structure

963
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Or this ring has a lot of double swords on it

964
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
These characteristics make these compounds

965
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Has a strong knee-light quality

966
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
like the clothes we wear

967
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
concurrent example

968
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Colored clothes worn on seat

969
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
There are some special chemical ingredients in it

970
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Can absorb some special light fragments

971
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
rendered color

972
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
is its complementary color

973
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
The same goes for these protein molecules

974
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
It has these special structures

975
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
with some special indirect compounds

976
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,240
so that it can only accept ultraviolet light

977
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,440
Or only specifically accept blue light

978
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,000
either red light or far red light

979
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,240
This deck has some properties like this

980
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
wait we get a chance to see one of these

981
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,840
But why on earth can it see red light or far red light

982
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,040
Basically plants have these pigments inside the cells

983
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,280
it can be used to say

984
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
For example, I now see a blue light and two red lights

985
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,080
Plants can understand

986
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,480
So in my current environment

987
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,600
It turns out that red light comes more than blue light

988
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,800
In this way plants can judge

989
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,080
What is the amount of red light in the environment now?

990
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,440
What is the amount of blue light

991
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,200
and its bright change

992
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,880
And what is the relative ratio between

993
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,200
So there can be an absolute sense

994
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,080
There can also be relative induction

995
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,920
Here are a few examples

996
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,000
Ultraviolet light plants if in case there is no these

997
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,600
When the eyes or chromophores can sense

998
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,000
will cause some colorblind Arabian plants

999
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,280
this is what i said

1000
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
I guess they don't want to be adults like this

1001
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
basically

1002
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But I think it doesn't make sense for me to say that now

1003
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I'll tell you what you think

1004
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
This is where different plants grow in the dark

1005
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
They are all tall and long

1006
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The lower elbow will be extended a lot

1007
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Then, Ziye will

1008
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
head bent

1009
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
See it here on Blu-ray

1010
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
These plants are grown on Blu-ray Thoughts

1011
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That's a normal plant

1012
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's when we don't make any moves

1013
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Normal plants should grow like this

1014
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
In this way, I think everyone should be familiar with the eyes

1015
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
multiple it looks like this

1016
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So what if we made a move?

1017
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Destroy the protein that receives blue light

1018
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
at

1019
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Plants are like people

1020
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
There are many genes in plants

1021
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Then we know which gene is

1022
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Made that protein specifically to receive blue light

1023
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
After destroying that gene?

1024
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
will see it

1025
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I have seen Blu-ray, I have seen it, I have not seen it

1026
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
It's just that it looks a bit like it looks in the dark

1027
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
right

1028
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
because it feels like saying

1029
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
something

1030
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Then you can also plant

1031
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
do some

1032
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
some processing is to say

1033
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,500
ok i now know which blu ray receiver

1034
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,500
A receptor for blue light is the main ingredient

1035
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,000
then I'll let it do a lot in the plant

1036
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Just using the rotor is the way of genetic modification

1037
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Let it do a lot of blue light receptors in plants

1038
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Then what happens is that

1039
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Just plants are too high, right?

1040
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
it sees a lot of blue light

1041
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It thinks it sees blue light all over the world

1042
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
so it grows very small

1043
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
That is to say, the effect of this extension is

1044
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
too obvious

1045
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So say you can see this

1046
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Then this one is what I call color

1047
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Then this one is too excited plant

1048
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
what about the other

1049
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
We just mentioned that there is a

1050
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Receptors for red and far-red light

1051
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
luciferin

1052
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
what about after you broke it

1053
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
it looks fine on blu ray doesn't it

1054
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Because it's not meant to be watched on Blu-ray.

1055
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So after you broke it

1056
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
it looks ok on blu ray no problem

1057
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
But this plant if you put it under a red light

1058
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
it won't work

1059
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,760
So it can be missing for this plant

1060
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,040
When looking at this red pigment

1061
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,000
It grows no problem on blu-ray

1062
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Because blue light can control the growth of plants

1063
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,600
I'm fine as long as the blue light receptors are there

1064
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,320
But I'm under the red light

1065
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,000
I just need this gene to be broken and I'll look wrong

1066
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,320
On the contrary, we just said that not only you

1067
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,040
something that receives blu ray

1068
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,760
reduce a lot or become a lot

1069
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,520
It looks normal under red light

1070
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,840
So there are these proteins

1071
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,600
Let me say that there are these genes and the products of these genes

1072
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
presence of protein

1073
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,000
Let the cells of this plant

1074
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
free to receive

1075
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,520
different light

1076
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,680
That's also because we deal with

1077
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,360
You can process blue light or you can process red light

1078
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,440
to judge

1079
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,120
what the hell did you break it

1080
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,000
what is the response of the cells it dominates

1081
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,840
So it's Blu-ray's hands and heels

1082
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,120
red hand

1083
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,480
Then the Arabic knot that shoots mans after falling off

1084
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,440
So you can't see blue light and you can't see red light.

1085
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,240
arabian knot plant

1086
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,600
good

1087
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,680
what's next

1088
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I'm going to take a moment to introduce you to

1089
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Plant Response to Red Light

1090
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
The ones I circled now are all plants

1091
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Things to do when exposed to red light

1092
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
it would love to sprout it would love

1093
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The leaves are opened, and then I accompany you around for a short time

1094
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
it will feel in fact feel

1095
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The ratio of red light to far red light will grow taller

1096
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It will have a biological clock, it will promote flowering and so on

1097
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
let's take a moment to talk

1098
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
why and how

1099
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
This is a recap of what we just saw

1100
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I think you should be very familiar with it by now.

1101
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Grow in the dark and under the light

1102
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
There is a very electrical characteristic that

1103
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
The back of the shrimp is short and the leaves are opened, right?

1104
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm going to tell you what I just said

1105
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
It has some different light receptors

1106
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
we all know how it came to be

1107
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
but at first

1108
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
how did you find these things

1109
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
That is to say, I will tell you now

1110
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I am also very good at opera. I have studied it over the past few decades.

1111
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Sun Moon Essence

1112
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,320
I will tell you a conclusion

1113
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
But at the very beginning

1114
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,400
how did biologists or botanists find this thing

1115
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,200
This is just as important as the external form we observed at the beginning

1116
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,200
We know that normal seedlings should grow under the light, right?

1117
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,400
Now I want to know which gene in which cell is controlling this process

1118
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,700
So one way I, a botanist, can do is to use genetic methods to study this technology

1119
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,700
The example given here is to say

1120
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,700
I know plants grow like this when exposed to light

1121
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,700
then i can imagine

1122
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,700
If the plant lacks the condition of sensing the external light environment,

1123
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,700
After a gene is broken

1124
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,700
my plants might grow like this

1125
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,700
For example, if I stay with you, it will last longer

1126
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,700
I can't shorten

1127
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,700
Or it means that my cotyledons cannot develop a good karma body

1128
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
I become more yellow, right?

1129
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,700
So I have this idea

1130
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,700
when in my heart

1131
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,700
I started doing some mutations on these seeds

1132
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,440
Usually dealing with some right-handed agents to allow some mutations in his genes

1133
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,240
When a gene mutation is severe enough, the gene is destroyed

1134
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,800
when it's broken

1135
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,400
Let's say we just destroyed luminin

1136
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,520
he can't see the red light

1137
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,840
Destroyed some flowering trees so he couldn't see the blu-ray and so on

1138
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,200
So after dealing with the right agent?

1139
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,720
You can put his purple belt on the spider

1140
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,160
grow in light

1141
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,840
then look for those

1142
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,360
look different

1143
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,520
looks very tall

1144
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,880
or look particularly yellow

1145
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,800
These plants may contain

1146
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,480
The gene that has the photoreceptor we want to study is affected by some

1147
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,160
destruction and mutation

1148
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,040
To study where these genes are bad

1149
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,880
Where is the damage in the nucleus?

1150
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,240
what gene is broken

1151
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,080
These can be studied by some methods of molecular biology

1152
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,360
Find out what's wrong with him

1153
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,600
After finding it

1154
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,960
we can

1155
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,280
Basically, a simple conclusion for everyone is that

1156
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,000
this is white light

1157
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,480
This is what we just saw in normal growth

1158
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,040
There are two mutations of luciferin seen here

1159
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
A so-called mutant strain

1160
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Bright tree A is under the far red light

1161
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
it just looks like under the dark

1162
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
The other one is Bright Tree B

1163
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
it grows under red light

1164
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Looks like it just grows longer than in the dark

1165
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So one can't see the red light

1166
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
One cannot see far red light

1167
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So in this way to find the corresponding gene

1168
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
which gene

1169
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Figure out which protein is receiving the light

1170
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
That

1171
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
without these

1172
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Kyodo grows taller

1173
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
It's a good thing you won't die like this

1174
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
but in fact it will

1175
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
it will have some serious repercussions

1176
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
For example this is

1177
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Normal curve length this home has started to bloom

1178
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Then if the corner does not have the gene of Bright Tree A

1179
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You will find that it just keeps growing leaves

1180
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
it won't bloom either

1181
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
If it doesn't bloom, we don't have bean shells to eat, right?

1182
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So this has a big impact

1183
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
what about the other

1184
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
tomato

1185
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
normal tomato it has started to turn green

1186
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Then you can harvest it when it turns red

1187
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that's normal

1188
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
When I took this tomato mutant to Guangming Tree A and B

1189
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
because it looks great

1190
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
This receptacle cannot develop normally

1191
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
So say there are lifted some white tomatoes

1192
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Probably a rare one in Japan

1193
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
popular varieties

1194
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But this is also a big sacrifice in terms of production.

1195
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
So when these luminophores do not exist,

1196
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Indeed, in addition to making plants grow taller,

1197
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
There are many follow-up pairs on production

1198
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Some effects on some growth

1199
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
In addition

1200
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
also a lot of fun

1201
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It is also a classic experiment

1202
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That is to say, I thought about it for a long time and couldn't give up.

1203
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I decided to explain this matter to everyone.

1204
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This is a

1205
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
looks like a photobiologist studying

1206
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
A very classic experiment in the development of light

1207
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
It's an experiment to germinate or not to germinate

1208
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
This is an experiment with a grip seed

1209
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
It is also observed in nature

1210
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
as if there were some rays between

1211
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
There are some phenomena of mutual relief

1212
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
For example, this grip seed is in the dark

1213
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
it has a poor germination rate

1214
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
When you see white soil coming out, that's the germination.

1215
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
after the red light

1216
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
sprouted well

1217
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But what about this naughty scientist

1218
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
After the red light was illuminated, the far red light was illuminated

1219
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
far red light

1220
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
Then I found that it didn't germinate again.

1221
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,400
Of course we're adding a dose of red light, right?

1222
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,440
sprouted again

1223
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,200
Then add another round light and it won't sprout again.

1224
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,320
So this is the boring science

1225
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,400
But this leads to a very important discovery

1226
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,200
It means that there is a rate of fire in the cell

1227
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,720
or have two rates of fire

1228
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,800
Inside the cells it receives messages of red light

1229
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,320
will also receive messages from the round red light

1230
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,840
Then these two things will counteract each other

1231
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,200
Let's see what was the last message you received

1232
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,000
Or turn the lights on, turn off the lights, turn on the lights, turn off the lights, turn on the lights, turn off the lights, turn on the lights

1233
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,920
Of course I knew to turn on the light

1234
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,560
So in the processing of the red light and the round red light

1235
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,960
basically telling the seeds of these diggers

1236
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,840
Are you going to sprout now or not?

1237
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,480
What was the last signal you received?

1238
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,200
It is what determines what the digging seed will do.

1239
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,520
This is a very classic lighting treatment

1240
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,120
An example of seed growth and development

1241
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,200
That luciferin itself is a very beautiful protein

1242
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,800
That's when I was doing my Ph.D.

1243
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,000
I'm just studying this luminosin

1244
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,820
this pigment

1245
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,120
If you have a way to store this pigment out of the cells

1246
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:05,920
easy to put in water

1247
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,600
when put in water

1248
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,640
It's a very nice teal an easy

1249
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,680
Then see if it is absorbing red light or

1250
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,120
A form that absorbs red light or a form that absorbs red light

1251
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,920
Then you know this teal is a little bit different

1252
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,760
very beautiful color

1253
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,960
So sometimes doing research work

1254
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,800
It's like my own research in molecular biology

1255
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,440
I'm always researching things I can't see

1256
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,680
That's us in the test tube

1257
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,120
some experiments done

1258
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,240
often do not know what to do

1259
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,080
because too small

1260
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,040
so eyes can't see

1261
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,440
other methods of analysis are required to see

1262
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,520
Therefore, it is possible to see the quality of a protein with ulterior motives.

1263
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,440
The color is so beautiful

1264
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,240
This is also a great condition for research work

1265
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,800
Then I want to tell you why I can see light

1266
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,400
not because i'm here

1267
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,800
This is my doctor class teacher

1268
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,400
His name is Clark Beggar and he is also in the University of California to share

1269
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,000
Then why did he let

1270
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,240
The book of light can see the light

1271
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,280
able to have a theoretical explanation

1272
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,920
a very important scientist

1273
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,200
This is in the Forbidden City

1274
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,200
After returning to work in Taiwan

1275
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,440
Once he came to Taiwan to visit us

1276
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,760
like looking at his own child

1277
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,160
own new toy

1278
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,600
when there is a new laboratory

1279
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,640
come care about us

1280
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,480
Then his discovery is actually very simple

1281
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,760
just like I just introduced to you

1282
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,480
last protein

1283
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,160
If he connects a pigment molecule

1284
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,720
Then he can see the light

1285
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,600
this gene

1286
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,480
Genes of most materials

1287
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,240
made in the nucleus

1288
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,200
inside the nucleus

1289
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,800
The nucleus will pass through some

1290
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,400
The Process of Molecular Biology

1291
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,480
molecules that make proteins

1292
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,560
that protein molecule

1293
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,760
Can't feel light by itself

1294
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,760
To be sensitive to light, it must accept

1295
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,560
some its called some

1296
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,320
Today he draws almost

1297
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,920
After my co-drilling union with him

1298
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,640
The whole combination of co-drilling

1299
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,320
contains this chromatophore

1300
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,600
itself with protein

1301
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,360
form a special structure

1302
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,960
This structure is able to absorb very accurate red light

1303
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Accurate round red light

1304
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,500
This rate of fire itself is created inside the karmic body

1305
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,000
So a very important discovery with Cocker-U.S.

1306
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,400
is to determine the structure of this

1307
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,100
This velocity body is four annular

1308
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,100
This structure with a lot of shoulders on it

1309
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,000
It is mainly to solve the structure

1310
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,300
After solving this structure, let us also understand it

1311
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,300
Why is this fire rate molecule itself able to see light

1312
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,200
This is a very important contribution of it

1313
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,300
This is an analysis of the absorption spectrum

1314
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,300
tell us because wait there's another absorption spectrum

1315
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,800
So I want to use this one to introduce to you first

1316
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,100
The horizontal axis of this graph is a wavelength

1317
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,600
is from 300 to 800

1318
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,800
We just said that visible light ranges from about 400 to 800

1319
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,100
Then the heavy axis is an absorbance value

1320
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,400
so I can absorb that particular wavelength of light

1321
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,700
A little more of this waveform is a little higher

1322
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,700
So you can see that it has parts that absorb red light

1323
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,000
also absorb far-red light

1324
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,500
It mostly does not absorb yellow or green light

1325
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,500
that is to say it is a rate of fire

1326
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,500
This is a light hand with a velocity body

1327
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,000
a property of itself

1328
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,160
Just now we told the story of two older brothers and one younger brother

1329
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,320
It was when I grew up in Shayin Lane

1330
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,280
Plants grow normally under light

1331
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,120
internode size leaf spread

1332
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,480
But if there are many brothers and sisters next to it

1333
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,080
It is said that many seeds are walking together

1334
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,320
when he sprouted together

1335
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,880
He will start to have some competition and some confrontation than plants grow

1336
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,840
At this point I think it's obvious that

1337
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,560
He will feel that the environment is not suitable

1338
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,960
It's not like he grew up in full sun

1339
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,760
what happened at this time

1340
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,680
So we are not plants

1341
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,080
we don't know what he was thinking

1342
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,000
But we can also machine can measure

1343
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,160
What is the current spectrum for plants

1344
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,640
what is it like

1345
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,280
For example, this orange line

1346
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,280
It's the spectrum under the sun

1347
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,040
Traveling sideways is the same wavelength

1348
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,120
Vertically, these different wavelengths of light

1349
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,120
how much is it

1350
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,120
so under the sun

1351
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,320
You can see most of it will be on Blu-ray

1352
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Then there are many parts of red light and far red light

1353
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,600
What does the little brother under the big brother feel?

1354
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,300
It's the blue one, it's the green one

1355
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,400
The green one you will find the plants under the green leaf print

1356
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:16,900
The waveform he felt was very different from that under the sun

1357
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,600
The most different part is that he lacks a lot of red parts

1358
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,800
Part of this red light has been absorbed by the leaves below

1359
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,300
The leaves are green, so most of his absorption is his

1360
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,100
Complementary color, red light

1361
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,400
Then when making light and making light, some very efficient long light

1362
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,000
So the situation he feels here is

1363
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,200
The ratio of red light to far red light under sunlight will be greater than 1

1364
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,400
Most of it is red light, a small part is far red light

1365
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,700
Most of the light below the green leaf print is far red light, and a small part is red light

1366
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,900
So his ratio is less than 1

1367
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,600
We just mentioned that there is a luciferin pigment molecule in the cell

1368
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,200
He can receive red light and far red light, right?

1369
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,800
So he can receive red light and far red light

1370
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,300
he can detect the ratio between the two

1371
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,100
what ratio is there now

1372
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,840
How much is the red light? How much is the original red light?

1373
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,960
When my original red light became so much

1374
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,800
I have no choice but to grow faster

1375
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,960
I'll have a chance to spit it out sooner.

1376
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,560
right

1377
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,440
This is one use for detecting the ratio between this red light and the original red light

1378
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,400
What about such a phenomenon?

1379
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,360
Also known as a response to shade avoidance

1380
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,520
Or called shareable is a bit of a description

1381
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,960
the shade avoidance response

1382
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,680
that often has some negative

1383
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,720
There will be some negative situations for plants

1384
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,680
Because it is already a last resort for plants to grow under such conditions

1385
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,160
right

1386
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,760
so it has to pay something

1387
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,960
and let it grow faster

1388
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,240
what does it cost

1389
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,760
The price is often this because the extension is very long

1390
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,680
it blooms early

1391
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,560
Or the plants bloom early

1392
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,120
Early flowering often has many disadvantages

1393
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,120
Because I haven't got enough energy to go bare metal

1394
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,560
So I may be outdated and not good in the future

1395
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,440
I don't plant enough seeds

1396
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,320
My plants are not strong enough

1397
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,640
That may be for some, such as this carrot

1398
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,440
This one is very extended

1399
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,120
Just to feel more far-red light

1400
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Chinese its output is not very good

1401
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,880
So this excessive masking of the currency response

1402
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,600
May have some negative effects on plants

1403
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,600
but

1404
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,000
there are always many things

1405
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,160
How you see things determines how you react

1406
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,960
So let's say an interesting scientist

1407
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,960
His name is Pearson Song

1408
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,840
He was born earlier in the United States

1409
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,680
that's not university

1410
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,680
And now at Kyushu University

1411
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,000
this one

1412
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,320
That was once he went to Taiwan

1413
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,320
It should have been made at the Interpretation Center.

1414
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,320
Then he has a different view on this matter

1415
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,680
I also think it's quite interesting

1416
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,280
Share it with everyone

1417
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,880
he took advantage of this

1418
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,280
Avoid this effect of shading

1419
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,120
He wants to make a new plant

1420
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,280
Then this plant is very useful.

1421
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,520
to consider

1422
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,120
and then introduce

1423
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,520
If we had a piece at home

1424
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,960
Might be more difficult in Taipei

1425
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,240
say you have a turf

1426
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,560
then you need to weed often

1427
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,000
that turf

1428
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
grow fast, right?

1429
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,500
And the turf has a feature that's what we just saw

1430
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
It means brothers and sisters grow very close, right?

1431
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,900
You used your turf thick enough next to you didn't you?

1432
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,400
The grass must grow very densely

1433
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,800
When the hair is very thick, do I often feel

1434
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,500
I'm too dense, I need to grow faster

1435
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,700
i want to grow longer

1436
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,300
If you want to weed, you have to work harder

1437
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,800
then you have to think more

1438
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,900
To be able to grow green, right?

1439
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,600
So this skimming society has a very good idea

1440
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
He said

1441
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,500
If you plant is using

1442
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,100
More far-red light is detected

1443
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,300
I'll make it grow faster

1444
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,200
With these shadowing effects

1445
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,700
If you avoid the effect of shading

1446
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,900
i make it invisible

1447
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,000
I just make it impossible to feel this

1448
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,600
there's no way to feel this

1449
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,300
it says it has making turf

1450
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,400
it has a genetically modified turf plant

1451
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,800
It can make plants feel

1452
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,300
Although it grows very crowded next to it

1453
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,800
But it doesn't feel that it feels so much

1454
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,100
far red light environment

1455
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,000
what about this time

1456
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,700
so I

1457
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,500
After I finished the production yesterday, it happened that I wrote it as a oil silk

1458
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,400
that is, it grows more slowly

1459
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,600
So you don't need to make a lot of noise

1460
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,400
it grows slower

1461
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,600
So its color will also

1462
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,100
because it grows slower

1463
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,020
slow growing

1464
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,640
because it also doesn't have some

1465
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,600
Some Behaviors of Pest Prevention Industry Development

1466
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,600
That's because the ones that grow slowly belong to your fertilizer

1467
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,940
Use less and be more environmentally friendly

1468
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,140
So what?

1469
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,460
everything has two sides

1470
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,440
just look at

1471
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,440
you know so i think

1472
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,160
When an interesting phenomenon like this is

1473
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,000
After a biological phenomenon I learned

1474
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,200
There is really infinite room for imagination

1475
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,800
Be around for years

1476
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,240
look what's going on

1477
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,800
is that you can apply what you have learned

1478
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,940
Intermorphic observed phenomena

1479
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,100
can improve your environment

1480
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:34,100
Or maybe it will help someone else

1481
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,860
it's an interesting sanity

1482
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,100
Should have started on Send Away

1483
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,940
has started in the wild

1484
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,100
start planting

1485
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,780
Speaking of Hongguang

1486
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,100
I would like to take a moment to introduce to you

1487
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,100
Plant Response to Blue Light

1488
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,600
What about the blue light?

1489
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,740
there are many

1490
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,600
For example, the seedling growth we just talked about

1491
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,540
Phase light, movement of karmic body

1492
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,860
Opening and closing of stomata, etc.

1493
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,860
These are the reactions to blue light

1494
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:57,200
That

1495
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,120
First look at the power of a blue light response

1496
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
that is

1497
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
in the middle

1498
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
these are some corn

1499
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
grown from corn

1500
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
This is supposed to be the tooth sheath

1501
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
The leaves haven't grown yet

1502
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
A fluorescent lamp was lit in the middle

1503
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
All the sheaths of everyone adore it

1504
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
so it's typical

1505
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
phase light type

1506
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
This example is just an enlarged illustration

1507
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Here is a more classic example

1508
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So this picture you will see

1509
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
blu ray from slice

1510
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
come in from the right

1511
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You can see that the corn sheath grows on

1512
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
inside a small room

1513
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
this corn tooth wall will be like

1514
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
blue light temperature zone

1515
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
This is the phase light type

1516
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
it's here

1517
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Except what we just saw was

1518
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
a single career corn

1519
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
There are also some dual career plants

1520
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
like sunflower

1521
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
In this light you will see

1522
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
will be from here

1523
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So after it grows some albino seedlings

1524
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
everyone sees these

1525
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
cute little corn tooth

1526
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,600
You can see a lot of listeners are starting to bend to the left as well

1527
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,760
So say bend to the left

1528
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,920
At the same time, some sharp-eyed people may also encounter

1529
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,320
While this bend

1530
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,120
its careers are starting to open

1531
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,720
Also began to develop, also began to change

1532
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,880
So not only red light but also blue light

1533
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,520
Also allows the plant to start the development of the wild aluminum body

1534
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,320
who found this

1535
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,120
or whoever found that answer

1536
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,320
why plants hang out

1537
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:29,120
Let me introduce this to you by the way

1538
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,720
So take this opportunity today

1539
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,480
let me introduce

1540
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,440
A few scientists who were very surprised in my heart

1541
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,200
They are in the phenomenon of these very interesting creatures

1542
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,920
the scientist who found the answer

1543
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,040
So this guy's called Winstall Briggs

1544
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,200
He is now at Stanford University

1545
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:42,880
Although he is very old

1546
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,240
He is a member of the American Academy of Sciences

1547
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,440
Those 18 years old are still very

1548
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,720
Self-reliant in research work Very dynamic

1549
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,520
he was in taiwan once

1550
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,440
Buy your own ticket and go to Neiwan

1551
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,880
I'm catching a plane in Taipei

1552
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,640
Then he went to Neiwan

1553
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,720
Then there is also a way in the middle

1554
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,120
Go to the store to order food

1555
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,520
warmly received

1556
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,140
Very very nice this is his wife Bara

1557
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:12,140
This is the ceramic wave tube we had in the gorge once

1558
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:16,300
He's the one who found out why

1559
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,800
Why is the person who shines

1560
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,400
found that protein

1561
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,700
how did he find it

1562
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:23,500
It is just like the method we just introduced to use 1 string

1563
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,900
After mutating the seeds of the plant

1564
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,100
Then let him see the blue light without turning his head

1565
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,800
found the mutant

1566
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,000
Look at these normal seedlings

1567
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,700
After Blu-ray comes

1568
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,100
how much they bend

1569
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,500
The speed of light of a single Blu-ray can be engineered

1570
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,700
so he'll make an almost 90 degree turn

1571
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,400
These mutant seedlings

1572
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,700
After the three elections, these are unmoved

1573
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:50,700
Seedlings unmoved by blue light

1574
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,500
Then Winsor & Brakes went back to study

1575
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,600
In these mutant seedlings

1576
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,400
After which gene is broken

1577
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,300
found the so-called phase light number of this protein

1578
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It is responsible for sensing the direction of blue light

1579
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
and greet it

1580
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Apart from

1581
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
like light beams to make plants feel

1582
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The direction of the blue light

1583
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
The wavelength of blue light has a direction other than the direction it comes from

1584
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
In addition, blue light also controls a very important phenomenon

1585
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It is the so-called Ye Luji's movement

1586
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
The displacement of Ye Luji in the cell

1587
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Ye Luji is inside the cell

1588
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So small, take good care of your muscles

1589
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
That is, how does he move in the cell

1590
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And what is the purpose and purpose of moving

1591
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Let's take a look at this picture

1592
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
you can imagine

1593
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
it's a cell

1594
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
For example, if you look at this leaf

1595
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Of course the cells are small

1596
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You can not see it

1597
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
This is a magnified view below the microscope

1598
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
this block

1599
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
represent individual cells

1600
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I saw a steamed bun inside

1601
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Tangyuan like buns

1602
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That's Ye Luji

1603
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So inside each plant cell

1604
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It has a lot of leaves

1605
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Dozens of leaf bodies

1606
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
There are also some like inside the cells of green algae

1607
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
only one large fat leafy body

1608
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Therefore, the type and number of chloroplasts are not the same

1609
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
In this post you are the leaf cells of duckweed

1610
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
You can see that there are a lot of chloroplasts in it

1611
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
This leaf body is in the dark

1612
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It just floats around freely in the sun

1613
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
inside the cytoplasm

1614
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
in dim blue light

1615
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's actually easier to float up

1616
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
able to float to the surface of this leaf

1617
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
conceivable leaf rate body

1618
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
If it is an institution where Qingjingguang's cooperation is very important

1619
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Of course it wants to receive as much light as possible

1620
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
when the light is very weak

1621
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Of course I'm going to try my best to get to the front

1622
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
can then receive light

1623
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
But when the light comes

1624
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
the light is strong

1625
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Strong enough to form some free machines inside the cell

1626
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
When some structures inside the cells are destroyed

1627
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Then they will hide

1628
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
It's just the beginning of the leaf body

1629
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
well maybe too much

1630
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,740
Let's send some stations up front

1631
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,100
Others we just hide behind and take a rest

1632
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,000
So it’s not that the karma in these cells is relatively small.

1633
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,940
It is the karmic body in these cells

1634
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:13,300
In fact, they are all ranked behind the first karma body.

1635
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,300
So this is called an act of avoidance

1636
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,300
That's when your current light is too strong to cause harm

1637
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,000
there are some evasive behaviors

1638
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,900
it's the act of gathering

1639
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,000
it's evasive behavior

1640
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,100
good

1641
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,300
that is to find this

1642
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,300
another great scientist

1643
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,900
is a scientist who finds it very interesting

1644
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,300
This one is called Masami Zhu Wada

1645
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,300
Mr. Wada

1646
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,000
He is at Kyushu University in Japan

1647
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,300
That's also a coincidence

1648
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,300
It's at Yingge's Tatsubou Pavilion

1649
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,700
this is his wife

1650
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,700
Let's see how he did an experiment

1651
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,000
wait a minute you will see a video

1652
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,200
How many cells are there in this movie

1653
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,000
then you will see a flash

1654
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,200
what about the flash

1655
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,700
is the speed of light of a faint blue light

1656
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,200
The speed of light is very small

1657
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,800
roughly smaller than a cell

1658
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,900
He will see a blue light at the speed of light

1659
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,600
Then after you see this beam, you will see the Lunar Luna

1660
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,400
would have been scattered at the edge of the cell

1661
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,100
You will see the lunar green body slowly move into this light beam

1662
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,500
let's take a look

1663
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,300
that's a lot of cells

1664
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,300
Then, you saw that the one that flickered just now was not dazzled

1665
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,800
really it has a beam

1666
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,800
The lunar green bodies you see are concentrated here

1667
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,400
So it has an accumulation response

1668
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,200
It is a phenomenon that it will be close to Vietnam light

1669
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,000
again

1670
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,400
We see the Luna and then we see the blue light here

1671
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,900
Then, the lunar chlorophyll will see, the blue light is coming, hurry up

1672
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,000
ok so hurry on over here

1673
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,800
So it's a clustering phenomenon

1674
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:43,200
The same thing, if the blue light you see is very strong blue light

1675
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,600
What will happened?

1676
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,200
will avoid, yes

1677
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,300
So many months of etiquette will start to hide aside

1678
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,100
So, just some blu-rays

1679
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,100
According to Strong Meat, I hope you can really agree

1680
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,000
Now I come with a few photons

1681
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,500
Most of the time, I just let go

1682
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,200
Be active when you are young

1683
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,200
so know how to go

1684
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Extremely must chest

1685
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,600
This Blu-ray portable

1686
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,600
This person is in the audience

1687
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,100
this is my daughter

1688
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,600
So this is someone who just got through

1689
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,600
Mr. Wada

1690
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,300
So why did you suddenly show this picture?

1691
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,600
In fact, I want to spend a lot

1692
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,400
Take a minute to introduce these two adorable scientists

1693
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,100
what about the scientists

1694
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:25,800
he has a very dynamic personality

1695
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:26,600
very interesting

1696
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,400
He waits for some Sly to introduce

1697
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,800
why he enjoys research work as he enjoys life

1698
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,000
The source of this picture is actually very interesting

1699
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,400
Just one time we had a photobiology meeting at home

1700
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,600
Those who attended were all famous

1701
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,500
or a paid self-care photobiologist

1702
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,000
what about my daughter

1703
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,600
Usually I've been conscripted everywhere since I was a kid

1704
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,600
Even in international conferences, no one can see her

1705
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,200
that in this meeting

1706
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:56,800
as soon as she heard

1707
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,600
This is a Japanese, so she hit his NDS and took it out

1708
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
All games are in Japanese

1709
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,500
I decided to ask this Japanese teacher to help him interpret it.

1710
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,500
I believe this is also the first time Wada sensei has played in his life

1711
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,500
Angry Baby Electric Toys

1712
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,500
It's obviously a lot of fun.

1713
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,500
I cherish this photo

1714
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,500
because it really reflects the

1715
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
An attitude towards life as a biologist

1716
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,500
full of everything

1717
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,500
positive outlook and enjoyment

1718
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,500
what new things come to him

1719
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
there is a positive energy

1720
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,500
The materials he studies are also very special

1721
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Because material is a good cell biologist

1722
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,500
Because the material is iron wire

1723
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
Iron Line Lord is an extinct plant

1724
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,500
It has two levels of four generations

1725
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,500
One is the fourth generation of double back body

1726
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,500
One is the three generations of a single back body

1727
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:51,500
Chromosomes are single and double

1728
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,500
Just like we are 46 people

1729
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,500
A single set is 23 pieces

1730
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,500
In this single set of four generations

1731
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,500
There is a so-called new type of single-set status

1732
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,200
This single set of lipids

1733
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,900
Shi Qi

1734
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:08,400
Then this poem is very suitable for some photobiological blood reactions

1735
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,400
the reason is because

1736
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,900
its shape is cute and what

1737
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:13,900
It has very few cells

1738
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,900
Often only one or a few layers of cells

1739
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,400
So it is very easy to observe the behavior of some karma bodies under the microscope

1740
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,900
So it is based on the use of this behavior to see

1741
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:24,700
Some distributions of these karma

1742
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,100
Then do some experiments with cellular blood and layered biological blood

1743
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,200
Then I'll show you this next

1744
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,800
slides also fully reflect it

1745
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,200
An act of pre-call entertainment

1746
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,400
If you still remember when we just watched the movement of chloroplasts

1747
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,200
there is a so-called

1748
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,600
To approach is to gather and dodge, right?

1749
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,700
That

1750
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,300
The next slides is this new shape

1751
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,700
Then it is designed a graphic

1752
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,600
Because this is a unique English is

1753
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,800
FIRM

1754
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,000
It just designed a piece of paper or a

1755
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,200
A small one through this transparent light through a membrane

1756
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,480
It says FERN

1757
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,840
What passes through the middle of this membrane is weak blue light

1758
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,600
So all these karmic bodies have gathered

1759
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,780
These other places are also cells one by one.

1760
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,680
But it shines strong blue light

1761
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,840
Therefore, these karmic bodies are all avoided to the edge of the cells.

1762
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,440
So it is natural that it uses such a design

1763
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,720
Let a new form in this creature

1764
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,760
It's an era of unique single-backed bodies

1765
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,080
renders a word it wants to describe

1766
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,760
That is to say, it also praises that the material it studies is a unique one.

1767
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:42,320
This is one that just wasn't highlighted with Photoshop

1768
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,000
is a design through which experiments

1769
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,360
Learn about the karma in the cell with it

1770
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:49,440
or what kind of behavior to move under what circumstances

1771
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,480
to finish the design

1772
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,440
Then design it

1773
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,760
entertaining itself and entertaining people like me

1774
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,360
Would be very grateful to have an idea like this

1775
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:58,920
a materialist

1776
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,920
So this is

1777
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,380
Mr. Wada, he also used this sprouted this

1778
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:07,480
This Protonema of one cell of this class

1779
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,280
to change the direction of the blue light

1780
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,480
Because he thinks the blue light is gone

1781
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,160
He'll let the guy spell his name Wada like this

1782
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,620
so very cute scientist

1783
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,500
good

1784
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,760
So what about the Blu-ray part?

1785
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,960
I want to give you a brief summary

1786
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,160
so blu ray

1787
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,520
what we just saw is

1788
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,640
Yerity's move

1789
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,560
When the strong blue light comes

1790
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,160
this

1791
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,560
Old Big Front Other Siblings

1792
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,960
small butcher tag on the back

1793
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,680
so the first one

1794
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,680
May be exposed to strong blue light

1795
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,600
Intense blue light damage

1796
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,640
There may be free machines in this leaf body

1797
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,240
moses system or protein in it

1798
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,560
may take some damage

1799
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,280
But what about the leaves behind?

1800
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,240
can be maintained intact

1801
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,080
but when these

1802
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,000
When the blue light comes, it is relatively weak

1803
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,600
or in the cell

1804
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:52,240
Two types of people receiving this Blu-ray message

1805
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,280
protein or two

1806
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,640
photopixel

1807
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,080
Prototropic One跟Two

1808
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,520
when damage occurs

1809
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,680
I can't accept it

1810
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,120
These strong blue lights come from

1811
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So I'm still scattered in the cytoplasm

1812
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,200
At this time, for these plants

1813
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,400
Is it actually the best way to survive?

1814
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,600
So the plant was originally in the wild form

1815
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,800
Contains these two proteins

1816
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,000
Can accept some changes in the environment

1817
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,200
source of some glare

1818
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,000
In addition, Nanguang has no chance to introduce to you today.

1819
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
related to the opening and closing of stomata

1820
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,600
For example, when light comes in, the stomata will open.

1821
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,200
that light

1822
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,400
It is said that the stomata in the two picture strains

1823
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,200
There is no way to open and close normally

1824
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,600
There's no way to open and close properly. In fact, there are many disadvantages.

1825
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,200
for example

1826
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,400
Its gas exchange cannot be normal, right?

1827
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,800
Then the circulation of water and the evaporation of water vapor will also be affected by some transplants

1828
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,800
So the water cycle can't be complete

1829
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,600
what about the other

1830
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,000
no chance to tell you

1831
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,200
But I think everyone should be able to imagine that

1832
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,800
this light

1833
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,600
The blue light receptor has another so-called silver flower pigment

1834
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,400
The silver flower pigment is mainly to control the extended seam of this gold

1835
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,000
It is that when it is illuminated, it will not extend so much

1836
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,800
So in this picture

1837
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,880
Let me introduce to you

1838
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,040
When the light comes from the side in the wild shape

1839
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,620
Its lower fly shaft can be extended and shortened

1840
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,000
it can also be photographed

1841
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,740
So it can feel both

1842
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:13,120
Because there are two hands with different blue lights doing different things

1843
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:13,880
Then what

1844
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,400
When your camera number is broken

1845
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,120
it has no way of judging the direction

1846
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,840
But it can still feel the shortened matter

1847
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,120
so it also knows it doesn't grow too long

1848
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,160
the opposite

1849
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,400
If you feel the length of the light

1850
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,360
You are only suitable when the two extended pigments are broken

1851
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,920
This part of its phase light is OK

1852
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,880
It can still face the direction of the light

1853
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,400
it can feel light

1854
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,280
But it has no way to control itself to continue extending

1855
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,200
So from this simple diagram it also tells us

1856
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,480
Plants perceive blue light mainly through two groups of hands

1857
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,680
A group is controlling the extension of crystal cloth

1858
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,600
a bunch of control

1859
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,440
direction of feeling

1860
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,840
The direction of the feeling is roughly divided into

1861
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,560
direction of feeling

1862
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,480
The direction the progress moves

1863
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,160
Also here it is more obvious

1864
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,040
that is more microscopic

1865
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,120
The direction of movement mentioned by the night traveler inside the cell

1866
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,800
Of course some reactions are

1867
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,800
Controlled by blue light and red light

1868
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:12,640
I just want to take a moment to introduce you to

1869
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,240
There are several phenomena

1870
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,720
Plant responses to both red and blue light

1871
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,600
In this section just now we have looked at many

1872
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,920
by

1873
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,000
Pigment control of luciferin and blue light absorption

1874
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,080
extension of lower peto

1875
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,800
Next we spend most of our time

1876
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,440
are placed in common with the other two

1877
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,680
Plant responses controlled by blue and red light

1878
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,240
is the establishment of the biological clock

1879
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,800
control of flowering time

1880
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,480
So let's talk about the difference between blue light and red light

1881
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,200
common regulation or biological clock

1882
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,240
Let's start with a

1883
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,040
One phenomenon is the so-called photoperiod

1884
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,240
It's not about school

1885
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,240
or in the Academia Sinica

1886
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,640
teacher you will bring students stories

1887
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,880
So it's talking

1888
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,400
The main thing to look at is these two plants

1889
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,160
Then this is just the indicator of the doll

1890
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,500
How big is this plant

1891
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:06,200
But judging from this age, it is indeed possible that the relationship between illegitimate children is abusive to each other, and it is also possible

1892
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,400
This is a normal tobacco plant

1893
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,500
it blooms in summer

1894
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,400
It's already on the top, I've already bloomed here, so I can't see clearly

1895
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,000
it's blooming

1896
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
This is a mutant

1897
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,200
It replaces a sensor time, a gene that senses daily

1898
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:32,000
After replacing it, it just grows leaves and doesn't bloom

1899
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
The cycle of plant growth is mainly divided into vegetative period and reproductive period

1900
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,500
The vegetative period is when the leaves grow

1901
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:44,000
When the environment is right, all the conditions are ripe

1902
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,700
Then I want to enter the reproductive period, and then I can start to enter the flowering period

1903
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:54,000
This tobacco, it just has a young shape, and there is no way to enter the reproductive period

1904
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,100
So in the timing environment the same happens for both grows

1905
01:12:57,100 --> 01:13:00,100
As you can see, this one has reached the roof of the greenhouse and it's still light with long leaves

1906
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,600
So it leads to another question

1907
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,600
Well, how do my plants know?

1908
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,600
Time is up

1909
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,600
how do you know right now

1910
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,600
In general, plants can be distinguished

1911
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,600
Not every plant will

1912
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,600
In line with the two I will talk about below

1913
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,100
form

1914
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,600
The first is the so-called short-day plants

1915
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,600
short day plants

1916
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,600
by this name

1917
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,600
it wishes the days were a little shorter

1918
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,800
it will bloom

1919
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,800
For example, in early spring

1920
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,800
or winter

1921
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,800
or in autumn

1922
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,800
Sunshine duration comparison short

1923
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,800
it will bloom

1924
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,800
Assuming this is 24 hours a day

1925
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,800
That is, we run in Dazhi Station

1926
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,800
is a day 24 hours

1927
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,800
if we still

1928
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:43,800
while the sun is turning

1929
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
our day is 24 hours

1930
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
24 hours a day

1931
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,800
So you can see this yellow is the day part

1932
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,800
gray is the night part

1933
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,800
so when your daylight hours

1934
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,800
longer than night time

1935
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,800
this plant does not bloom

1936
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,800
or your daylight hours

1937
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,800
shorter than night time

1938
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,720
under the condition of so-called short daylight

1939
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,960
this plant blooms

1940
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,120
Of course I want to say

1941
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,320
So am I two days or two nights?

1942
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,120
right

1943
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:09,840
so i can do an experiment

1944
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,080
He just makes the night a flash of light

1945
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,040
maybe a few minutes of flash

1946
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,120
Then I mess up the schedule for the evening.

1947
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,440
Because the days are still as short

1948
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,840
But this time the plants are not blooming

1949
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,160
So if we say to do this experiment

1950
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,200
let you guys decide

1951
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,240
How do plants feel the length of the day?

1952
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,440
or the length of the night

1953
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,160
what do you think it is feeling

1954
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,120
night

1955
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:32,920
oh good

1956
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,840
Hey, everyone who is interested in coming to my laboratory

1957
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,480
What has been done in botanical research

1958
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,080
Because the reaction is too fast

1959
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:40,800
So this is

1960
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,720
The length of time a night is detected

1961
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,880
So in fact it is like

1962
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,600
How long are the two nights

1963
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,720
to have a continuous

1964
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,880
length of night

1965
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,280
That opposite long-day plant is like

1966
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,800
longer days

1967
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,800
that or the night is shorter

1968
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,040
so look at this picture

1969
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,360
In fact, it also fits this play

1970
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,080
That is, long-day plants have very long days.

1971
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
bloom that night

1972
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,600
daytime hours below a transit point

1973
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,600
it doesn't bloom

1974
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,600
If you say that you shine a little longer at night

1975
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,400
When it breaks the length of its continuous night

1976
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,600
It will also think it seems like it has enough sun time

1977
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,600
it will bloom too

1978
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,800
This is a fresh plant

1979
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,600
Many plants will be classified in both

1980
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,400
Some plants are less sensitive to the length of the day

1981
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,200
So the plant called heavy Dayneutral

1982
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:27,600
There are also some so-called firmly believed fresh artificial plants

1983
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,600
That's when it likes to make it fresh

1984
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,800
bloom earlier

1985
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,800
But if you insist on growing it in short-day conditions

1986
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,400
After a long time, it will bloom as a last resort

1987
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,800
Are there different types of plants?

1988
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,200
However, conceptually it can be divided into two

1989
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,400
So this is another example

1990
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,000
Am I measuring the length of the day or the length of the night?

1991
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,200
So it's twenty-four hours a day

1992
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,800
This is a short day plant

1993
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,000
So the days are shorter

1994
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
It blooms when the night is longer

1995
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,800
The days are longer and the nights are shorter

1996
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,000
It looks like daytime when it's illuminated at night

1997
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
It's a long day and it doesn't bloom

1998
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,440
Then this Wenpi scientist is about to appear.

1999
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,200
Then I'll adjust the two as well

2000
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:10,000
Just not 20 hours a day

2001
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,840
I adjust a growth phase to let it inside

2002
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,520
18 hours a day or 16 hours

2003
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,640
Both are the same length, no

2004
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,840
Then my days and nights are also very long

2005
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,680
OK, there will be flowers here.

2006
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,320
So here's another example to show us

2007
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,320
it measures the time of night

2008
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,160
good

2009
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,680
Then I'll just measure the time

2010
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,680
how does it know where this time is

2011
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,080
if you remember

2012
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,160
or how do i know

2013
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,680
I've been in the sun for a few days

2014
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,880
that's how I count

2015
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,240
how do i calculate how long a day is

2016
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:44,000
How long is the day and how long is the night

2017
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:44,920
i can see light

2018
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,040
just let everyone understand

2019
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,240
see it

2020
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,160
But when we have to measure this time again

2021
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,200
That sounds a little difficult, doesn't it?

2022
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,520
So if you remember this

2023
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:53,560
we just watched wrist beans

2024
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,320
normal carpus it blooms

2025
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,520
Brachiopsis lacks brightin

2026
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,000
When the pigment body that absorbs the red light source, the red light

2027
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,740
it won't bloom

2028
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,600
so say say

2029
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,740
There is no way to measure the temperature in this case

2030
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:06,800
some changes along the way

2031
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,920
no way to measure

2032
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,800
a signal from the light

2033
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,500
Then we will talk about it

2034
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,800
when the light comes in

2035
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,700
In fact, light and temperature will also

2036
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,880
Both light and temperature will make plants

2037
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,440
In fact, people are too

2038
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,920
Can feel the changes in the current environment

2039
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,400
how long is the day now

2040
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,260
how long is the night

2041
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:27,440
24 hours a day tour changes

2042
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,040
that can also train plants

2043
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,940
to build a living organism inside a cell always

2044
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:34,040
then we can

2045
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:34,840
sorry for that plant

2046
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:37,140
I imagine myself as the Arab world

2047
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,940
make plants predictable

2048
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,340
tomorrow morning

2049
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:42,940
When is 6 o'clock and 8 o'clock?

2050
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,440
That is a built-in creature always

2051
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,040
I have a habit every day

2052
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,540
what time do i want to do

2053
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,540
So the creature always has three main

2054
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,040
elements of operation

2055
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,140
The first one must have light come in

2056
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:55,040
Passage of photons

2057
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,240
For example, the bright element we just talked about

2058
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,240
or luciferase

2059
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,540
after receiving

2060
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,280
after receiving

2061
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,040
new signal

2062
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,760
to help build up the missing organisms inside the cells

2063
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,440
It is called a Central Oscillator

2064
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,840
build heat creature missing

2065
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,800
after operation

2066
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,400
The creature is missing as soon as it starts functioning it can be measured

2067
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,720
how much daylight is every day

2068
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,000
how much is the night

2069
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,360
After that established

2070
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,320
it can then tell some of its downstream physiological responses that

2071
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,760
ok you can flower now

2072
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,000
You can now open the air control

2073
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,440
You can now do some op-filtering, growing, etc.

2074
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,480
The growth of these transport filters

2075
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,240
Let's look at some examples

2076
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,440
Where is the creature missing?

2077
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,040
This was in a joint newspaper last year

2078
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,880
I want these below the road

2079
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,920
It may be more relevant to you

2080
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,040
There are animals and there are things that are missing

2081
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,400
What about the missing animal creature?

2082
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,720
can be explained at different times

2083
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,720
like midnight

2084
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,080
you may start to sleep

2085
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,400
slow gastrointestinal motility

2086
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,720
Then it might be easier to have

2087
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,320
dangerous diseases

2088
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:48,240
What are some physiological and biochemical reactions?

2089
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,520
This is more related to the disappearance of creatures compared to people

2090
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,200
The plants are the same to people as they are to people.

2091
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,560
Of course there may not be some stroke

2092
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,320
We just talked about some diseases

2093
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,000
But there will also be some missing creatures

2094
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,560
What about the life clock? Its English name is Sacadian with him

2095
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,860
That's the meaning of the law

2096
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,760
life clock

2097
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,760
Sacadian is a Latin prefix

2098
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,160
It is Sacadian, which means about a day

2099
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,360
So a 24 hour cycle

2100
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,000
There are many cycles in nature that are not 24 hours

2101
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,160
For example, tides are not

2102
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,320
Then there are some loops

2103
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,360
as long as it's a cycle it's a cycle

2104
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,860
The length of time is not certain

2105
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,360
But if say with

2106
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,620
The Ninth Rotation and Part of the Ninth Rotation

2107
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,620
If facing the sun, a day is 24 hours

2108
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:39,060
Life clocks are very widespread in a wide variety of organisms

2109
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,760
From the simplest blue-green palm

2110
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,220
unicellular blue-green palm

2111
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:45,220
to higher fungi

2112
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:48,320
For example, Negotiper to the animal kingdom, the plant kingdom

2113
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:53,460
Many creatures have found the presence of missing inner creatures

2114
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,560
What does the plant's biology go missing?

2115
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,660
manage a lot

2116
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:00,060
Life Clock tubes some elite performances

2117
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,100
Some genes are expressed more in the morning and less in the evening

2118
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,180
Or some plans are more and less in the morning

2119
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:08,820
Changes in the concentration of some ions in the tube cells

2120
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:12,500
Regardless of whether some proteins have to undergo specialization

2121
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,100
Or the opening of the mobile air hole led by the pipe industry

2122
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:17,700
or like going at an extended speed

2123
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:20,800
You look at the mass over there as if it's all the same rate

2124
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,800
It actually grows fastest in the early morning

2125
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:25,900
So at the dawn of each day

2126
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,700
It will only grow, progress and extend the fastest

2127
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,900
or some career moves

2128
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,900
Wait a minute and you will have a chance to see a short video

2129
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:36,000
The opening and closing of the flowers, of course, the Qianliuhua we saw at the beginning

2130
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:36,800
its opening and closing

2131
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,000
and control of flowering time, etc.

2132
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,100
These are all biological clocks

2133
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,000
Then I think the most familiar example is

2134
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,600
Sunflowers will face the sun, right?

2135
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:47,900
That

2136
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,500
This is a sunflower plant

2137
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,900
It's actually a young sunflower

2138
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:53,900
This is a sunflower leaf

2139
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,100
this side is east this side is west side

2140
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,700
So in the morning after the sun comes in at noon

2141
01:20:58,700 --> 01:20:59,900
The leaves of the sunflower

2142
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,300
Expand like a sun and start photosynthesis, etc.

2143
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,960
Of course the time passed in the afternoon

2144
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:07,800
he starts facing west

2145
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,520
Facing a west sunset

2146
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,080
then when night comes

2147
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:12,600
The whole night begins to blow

2148
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,760
that's amazing

2149
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:15,920
Wait a minute and the sun will come out when you see this thing, right?

2150
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,200
when the sun can still come out

2151
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,480
You see his leaves are already

2152
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,080
Ready

2153
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,200
good

2154
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:22,440
he knows

2155
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:25,160
He knows where the sun is going to come out

2156
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,560
he also wants to get ready

2157
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,720
he has to be ready

2158
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,720
The sun comes out and live there small

2159
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,040
build like a clock

2160
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,880
Allowing organisms to anticipate future changes in the environment

2161
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,560
as long as it changes periodically

2162
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,160
I can go through the establishment of biological clock

2163
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,000
tell the director

2164
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,840
when do you get ready early

2165
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,000
I should be able to use this example

2166
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,120
to tell my daughter about her test preparation

2167
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,200
then this is

2168
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,920
Another common misconception we have

2169
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,120
that is to say like a sunflower

2170
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,280
That means he should be chasing the sun, right?

2171
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,200
but i think

2172
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,120
Everyone should be able to imagine

2173
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,840
If living things can grow well

2174
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,640
that head is so heavy

2175
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,160
Why is there still a way to turn left at all?

2176
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,600
So this is too difficult for it

2177
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,040
So in fact like the leaves of a sunflower

2178
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,600
The phenomenon of chasing the sun will exist

2179
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,400
i am young plants especially obvious

2180
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,600
But mature like this flower of a sunflower

2181
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:12,400
the part that produces the sunflower seeds

2182
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,000
it will of course go west

2183
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:14,600
good

2184
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,000
good

2185
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,200
that except the leaves follow the sun

2186
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,200
In addition, the life clock also controls the movement of many plants.

2187
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,200
for example

2188
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,400
in this is a

2189
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,800
But the leaves of planted plants will follow

2190
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,000
The swing of the blades is carried out at different times of the day

2191
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,800
Maybe that angle at night is the same as this angle

2192
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,000
Clamp feet are relatively small

2193
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,200
Open to receive sunlight during the day

2194
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:41,000
It will hang down at night

2195
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:43,840
that life clock

2196
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,400
How does it work when you're in the west

2197
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,600
I have a few slides to briefly explain to you

2198
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,000
So the living clock has three elements

2199
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,200
The first requirement is to have a government

2200
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,500
That is to say when the life clock is at its highest

2201
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,000
when is the lowest

2202
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,500
What is the difference between high and low

2203
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,100
is the whole

2204
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,720
what is the difference

2205
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,120
Some creatures are already slow

2206
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,320
because of the large

2207
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,240
The second is to say

2208
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,240
where is my highest point

2209
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,640
or where is the lowest point

2210
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:10,840
Where is the relative position

2211
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:11,840
This is the so-called face

2212
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,840
The other is the length of a cycle

2213
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,440
For most living things on earth

2214
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,040
almost 24 hours

2215
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,000
Because long-term evolution follows our environment

2216
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,200
always in sync

2217
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,200
so almost 24 hours

2218
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,840
But following biological

2219
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,880
its time is not quite the same

2220
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,120
sometimes a little longer

2221
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,080
also slightly shorter

2222
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,360
So this is three elements

2223
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:36,400
we were just talking

2224
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,320
This figure has three elements

2225
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,920
when among living things

2226
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,480
often draw this waveform

2227
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,600
like a birth mother

2228
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,120
or the spring lady

2229
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,600
there will be some waveforms

2230
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,080
How are these waveforms generated

2231
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,080
I must have this waveform

2232
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,200
i just know

2233
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,640
how it works in my biology

2234
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,000
where is my vertex

2235
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,960
where is my low point

2236
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,160
If the horizontal axis is time

2237
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,560
I will know my apex

2238
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,000
or what time

2239
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Therefore, some digital measurements are often required so that biological plasma can produce this waveform

2240
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Then give it some meaning and common sense to explain some biological phenomena that can be explained behind it

2241
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
For example, here is the figure we just talked about where the blade can swing up and down

2242
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
We can make an angle between it and the horizontal and measure that angle

2243
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
At different times, there is a different angle with the horizontal

2244
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Measure different 24-hour period measurements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

2245
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
After measuring 6 or 7 cycles, we can see the generation of this waveform

2246
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
So say this is a way

2247
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
You can measure some physiological responses such as the angle between the leaf and the horizontal

2248
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Or you can measure gene expression

2249
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Many of them are now talking about all the physiological reaction phenomena and so on.

2250
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
It's actually a result of genetic expression

2251
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
So if we want to study the performance of a gene

2252
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
The main structure of a gene is that it has a start value that is responsible for

2253
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,780
activate the expression of this gene

2254
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:04,600
This startup value often has many single values ​​to regulate

2255
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,400
He come tell him you do this you do that

2256
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,200
How much do you show now

2257
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,720
or you don't act now

2258
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,040
So the behavior of this startup value itself

2259
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,360
It represents the possible behavior of this gene in the cell

2260
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:15,880
But

2261
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,920
I can't see him there, can I?

2262
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,480
So often one of the things biologists do

2263
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,040
is followed by a reporter gene

2264
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:26,120
We will know the nature of this reporter gene

2265
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,900
we will know what food he likes to eat

2266
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,720
After eating something, he will spit out a product

2267
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,280
That product may emit some biological luminescence

2268
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,840
As long as there is light, we can do detection

2269
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,660
For example, adding a starting value to this particle

2270
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,180
Let's catch a cold light

2271
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,720
he will be in a special

2272
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,000
Luminous

2273
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,560
under the camera he can see

2274
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:47,360
This value emits light

2275
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,660
So you can imagine this gene

2276
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,220
All of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden

2277
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:56,820
Then you are under this camera and you take pictures in the way we just told the truth

2278
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,820
Can you see it turn on and off

2279
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
can imagine

2280
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,500
let's take a look

2281
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,700
this is

2282
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,600
Wait a minute and you'll see a row of plants

2283
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,760
It just has two leaves and two small

2284
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:08,560
coniferous

2285
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,600
Then use the method of time-lapse projection to see the results of this reporter gene expression

2286
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,300
So this is a plant from the Arab world

2287
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:18,400
These two plant leaves These two are needles

2288
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,500
So this is after three or four days of continuous shooting

2289
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,500
exist

2290
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,800
fast and fast

2291
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,200
to tell everyone

2292
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,800
can be used in such a way

2293
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,500
So you can base

2294
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,400
this is a lot of images

2295
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,400
get together

2296
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,600
You will do quantification based on different images

2297
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,600
you can make this waveform

2298
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,200
this is also a study

2299
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:43,400
A frequently used tool for gene expression regulated by biological prey

2300
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,100
There is another characteristic of biological eaters, that is,

2301
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,200
After it is trained

2302
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,600
it can be done in the same way

2303
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,200
Even if you don't train it anymore

2304
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,600
You remove the factor of environmental constraints

2305
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,400
For example

2306
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,700
After a week of training I started giving him 12 hours of day and dark

2307
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,600
Bioeater builds strong

2308
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,400
At this time suddenly funded it

2309
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,060
The light environment does not give it darkness

2310
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:07,400
Or give it a dark environment without giving it light

2311
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,800
My biological eater will continue

2312
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,200
But the government will slowly get a little bit smaller

2313
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,500
Then I think this has something to do with everyone.

2314
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:16,400
For example, flying to a country with a different urban area

2315
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,900
There will be some parallax at first

2316
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,900
It's also because we were trained in Taiwan

2317
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,200
We are used to this time being morning and evening

2318
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,800
When you're dropped into a different urban area

2319
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,800
You still keep your inner bioeater going

2320
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,800
Well, the genes of that profession know what time it is.

2321
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,000
For example in this example

2322
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
We're pretty used to seeing this waveform by now.

2323
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Then this waveform has two colors

2324
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,400
One that is red is the gene expressed in the morning

2325
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,500
it's morning it's morning

2326
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,300
there are some evening genes

2327
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,700
especially high in the evening

2328
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:48,500
when we had that design just now

2329
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,300
You'll find out which genes are more abundant in the morning

2330
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,000
Which genes are more abundant at night

2331
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,600
Then why have these two

2332
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:57,300
There are morning genes and evening genes

2333
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,900
In fact, it allows organisms to build

2334
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,600
Biology always has a very important foundation

2335
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:04,300
the reason is this

2336
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:05,700
For example

2337
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:06,800
this is night

2338
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,100
this is daytime

2339
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,700
What about after I have the morning genes?

2340
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,700
it's these two

2341
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:12,800
what about these two

2342
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,100
He just can't see others well

2343
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:15,100
when i become more

2344
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,400
I'm going to suppress the emergence of the evening gene

2345
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,200
So I just load

2346
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,100
I just load during the day

2347
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:20,800
I am

2348
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,200
dominate

2349
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,000
I don't let the evening genes show up

2350
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,200
Until the activation value of my gene started to weaken

2351
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:29,100
My gene expression is going to be less

2352
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,200
I was able to lose my will to him

2353
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,800
at this time in this

2354
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,800
Authoritarian evening genes finally able to perform

2355
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
but he

2356
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:38,400
No

2357
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,600
not likely to retaliate

2358
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,000
He will actually help find the genetic expression

2359
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:44,400
So after he helped find the genetic expression

2360
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,400
came back to realize his own performance

2361
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,300
so what

2362
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,900
This is a kind that is often seen in biology

2363
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:50,400
So-called

2364
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,300
negative feedback control

2365
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,000
that is

2366
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,200
one up

2367
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,000
awareness of another

2368
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,400
Until he can't realize it

2369
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,500
another up

2370
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,800
What about when the other one wakes up?

2371
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,100
He showed another

2372
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,600
Therefore, a cycle of 24 hours a day is established between positive and negative

2373
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:06,520
So the creature is missing inside

2374
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,240
Simple one basic molecular mechanism

2375
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:15,440
Such molecular mechanisms are expected to exist in a wide variety of biological systems

2376
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:21,440
For example, in rats, in state-owned plants, in Arab-built plants

2377
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,600
Both have the so-called one positive and one negative loop structure

2378
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,960
This loop may only have one loop or two loops or five loops

2379
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,480
or even more loops

2380
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:32,480
The ingredients in it are not quite the same

2381
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,720
But the concepts used are very similar

2382
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,120
Also for your reference

2383
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,120
ok i think last

2384
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,280
I don't think it's too early

2385
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,920
I want to use two photos to summarize with everyone

2386
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,680
This is the part I will introduce to you today

2387
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,840
It is how to see the light environment afterwards

2388
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,280
The light environment has UV

2389
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,080
Up to blue light, red light and round red light in visible light

2390
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,680
different pigments after

2391
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:59,600
Some brightness and qualities of these lights are acceptable

2392
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,280
What kind of light is coming in now, what kind of abnormal light is in the environment

2393
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,380
What is the ratio of each other

2394
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:08,060
If I have these pigments receiving these rays

2395
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:11,920
Then I also tell others how much I have received now, let's compare

2396
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,220
Then compare the results and synthesize them, so that plants can interpret

2397
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:18,440
What is the external light environment now, and what kind of response should be done

2398
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:22,020
What about these reactions, from the implantation of front teeth to the growth of small seedlings

2399
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,120
To avoid phagocytosis, to the movement of something like light or liquid in cells

2400
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,980
to the process of final flowering or the establishment of biological anaxia, etc.

2401
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,000
These are all because there are some light receptors in the plant

2402
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,120
After a series of biological reactions, it tells the plant

2403
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:39,800
Can make the most appropriate adjustments to the light environment in which we live now

2404
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,800
with growth and development

2405
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:45,420
In the end, use this slice with

2406
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,200
Thank you all for taking so long to sit here today

2407
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:52,740
It also gave me the opportunity to help with research topics that I am very passionate about.

2408
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,340
have the opportunity to share with you

2409
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:57,660
that in nature i think

2410
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,980
Everywhere, especially in the face of plants, there are often

2411
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,800
Lots of surprises and beautiful pictures

2412
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:08,400
I also hope that you will spend so long here tonight

2413
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,200
I can also be safe with my family

2414
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,800
what's the problem if wait

2415
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,600
I am also very proud to have further discussions with you

2416
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,400
thank you

2417
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,700
Thank you Dr. Wu for introducing the world of plants

2418
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,400
with its life affected by light

2419
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:30,600
then we are open to ask questions

2420
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:35,900
good

2421
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,900
press the green

2422
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,300
ok, teacher wu, may i ask

2423
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,000
different vegetables

2424
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,700
Let's talk about how different vegetable groups respond to light

2425
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,800
For example, the wavelength of the response of blue light

2426
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:53,300
Or will the wavelength of red light be the same?

2427
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:57,400
I guess again

2428
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,900
that is to say it could be very close

2429
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,120
Then this may decide, if you remember that we had a spectrum of Xiguang just now

2430
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,320
You will find that its newly received wavelength actually has a certain range

2431
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,880
It's not that only at 400 or 380

2432
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,280
it's probably around 350 to 420

2433
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,980
So maybe look inside the species of this plant you are interested in

2434
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,880
What is the structure of its light receptor

2435
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,920
So but I'm sure it's probably not like

2436
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,800
Does not jump from 350 to 450

2437
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,280
Of course it will be in that mission

2438
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,400
Maybe the pick at the tip will be a little bit shifted left and right

2439
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,520
So different ones should be the same

2440
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,720
My idea is to say

2441
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:35,920
like olives and kegs

2442
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,440
then we can control its different wavelengths

2443
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:41,760
Can control its different growth rate

2444
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:42,800
It might work

2445
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,120
Yes, in fact there are some

2446
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,880
I know there are some people who think of growing as cultivating

2447
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,400
He'll actually add some different shades of light to encourage plant growth

2448
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,080
For example, add some red light or some blue light

2449
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,600
Indeed there is such a situation

2450
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,600
Thank you, Mr. Wu, you are wonderful and clear

2451
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,960
You just mentioned that the light is stronger and there is an avoidance reaction

2452
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:14,840
Our side is especially in the Yale belt or when the summer sun is in the middle of the tropics

2453
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:19,960
The sun is very strong, the UV index is even harmful to people

2454
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:23,040
So I'm wondering is dodging enough? Do they have

2455
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,860
Can you not talk about other mechanisms? If

2456
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:29,440
If the light is too strong or its energy is too strong

2457
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,440
Is there any kind?

2458
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,560
Because lawyer Ye in the row in front has been dying until the flames

2459
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:39,440
More may not sacrifice enough

2460
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,960
i think what do you mean

2461
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,000
Yes, plants actually have some other mechanism

2462
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,840
For example, on high mountains you can see a lot of leaves

2463
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,120
it has a lot of melt hair on it

2464
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,480
hairy on the leaves

2465
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,680
It's actually a specialized tissue of the epidermis

2466
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:53,520
The melting hairs are different because of their different angles.

2467
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,800
So it can be refracted by UV

2468
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,600
so it can be lower

2469
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,160
These high energies come in and make the temperature of the plant bigger

2470
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,600
Too high, or generate too much energy, generate a lot of free machines

2471
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,600
So it's a kind of

2472
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,600
that or he will

2473
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:09,200
For example, if the plants are really, you will see some drooping

2474
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:12,100
As soon as the leaves start drooping, he won't follow

2475
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:13,600
The light comes from the feet

2476
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,900
That is to say, he lowered the area of ​​acceptance a little.

2477
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,200
that or

2478
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,400
If the trachea is opened wide, it is easy for him to be under such high temperature

2479
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,400
he keeps evaporating

2480
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,600
His plants will be short of water and will have tail vultures

2481
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,100
So he might have some conditions where he'll shut off the windpipe.

2482
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,700
Keep plants from comparing

2483
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:32,300
In an environment without dispersal, it is easy to lack water

2484
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,400
So plants are actually colorful and interesting

2485
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,900
It's because people can build energy chambers

2486
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:40,300
That plant is there, he just has to withstand the wind, vertically bask in the rain

2487
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,800
What about today, the weather will be better, and tomorrow the weather will be worse

2488
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,900
he has to endure

2489
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,500
So he has all sorts of mechanics

2490
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,700
You can let him be a little tougher

2491
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,700
Be able to accept the environment a little more

2492
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,100
inside you mean for example

2493
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,800
You said molecular level

2494
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,000
Because you just said that he has a free machine

2495
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,900
we know this

2496
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
So it also has some mechanisms for removing free machines

2497
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Or something like the closing of the stomata itself, etc.

2498
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
It also needs to go through some molecular reactions

2499
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
For example, the permeability of some ions needs to be changed

2500
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And then some paying hormones are going to be involved

2501
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
It will help the stomata to close freely

2502
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The stomata are like a rod-shaped cell

2503
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
One side is thicker and the other is thinner

2504
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
So when water comes in it will ride away

2505
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
It closes when the water goes out

2506
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
So decide when the water is going to come in

2507
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,000
water going out

2508
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Then this is related to the many ions in the cell

2509
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
plus ion

2510
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Or maybe some payment hormone is related to a control of cleavage into acid

2511
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
So it does have some molecular biology

2512
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
The above academic qualifications can explain

2513
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
good

2514
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Classmate Ye from behind

2515
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Teacher, thank you for your wonderful speech

2516
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I think what you're describing is

2517
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
More about plants with leaves

2518
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Those receptors that respond to these light

2519
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Is it different on top of the extra plants

2520
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
succulent plants

2521
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
For example, like a cactus or Lu Hui

2522
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I'm sorry I designed less

2523
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
i don't know if there are some

2524
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
basic research in science

2525
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Be Valued Above These Succulents

2526
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
there may be one in

2527
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Inside some succulent plants by the sea

2528
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Some studies have been done, such as anti-inflammation

2529
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
part of the light receptor

2530
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
let me see

2531
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
The light receptors themselves may be relatively few

2532
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
But some changes in some patterns of light

2533
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
or a reaction to adversity

2534
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
There will be quite a lot

2535
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
good

2536
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
the dark green one

2537
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Just now that Dr. Wu talked about light

2538
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
White light Blue light Red light

2539
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I have a very simple

2540
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Compare Snorkeling Questions

2541
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,000
it's inside our house

2542
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
such as flowers

2543
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
what if my light bulb

2544
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
replace it with the white one

2545
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
or change to red

2546
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
change to blue

2547
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Does it have this effect on them?

2548
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
For you, the question is actually very practical.

2549
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
I have the same situation myself

2550
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
It is the plant that I grow in my home

2551
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
or grow lab plants

2552
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Every light tube on the body is

2553
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
It has its own special spectrum

2554
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
that mostly we see that white

2555
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
spring white kind

2556
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,000
It often has a slightly lower red light

2557
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
that some will also depend on how long it's been used

2558
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
There will be a slightly different wavelength of color light

2559
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
will subside a little

2560
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
So when I use it in the laboratory

2561
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I sometimes say

2562
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
There are some machines that can measure the full spectrum

2563
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Or buy light bulbs to eat like Philippine fu

2564
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
it will often

2565
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
it's actually on the site

2566
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's been a long time since it's the model of the light bulb

2567
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
some spectral values

2568
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Then if you find it 600

2569
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Or a band around 400

2570
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
when relatively low

2571
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Well, there are actually some light bulbs in the house.

2572
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Can add some red light

2573
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
actually helps

2574
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
The color of the flower and the light

2575
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,920
Does the light source matter?

2576
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:07,200
For example, do red flowers need to use red light?

2577
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:11,240
Or blue flowers, purple flowers need to use blue light

2578
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:12,240
Is there such a saying?

2579
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,560
I would think there should be no

2580
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,120
Maybe their different colors are in his cells

2581
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,400
There are some different color families

2582
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:22,240
The result of receiving different lengths of light

2583
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,040
So say I think if say

2584
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,400
To have a plant that should be, say, healthy

2585
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,720
He may be more colorful

2586
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:31,320
That will allow the plants themselves to grow better

2587
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:34,040
Maybe his original color will show up just fine

2588
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,600
Should not require special light to handle

2589
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:38,440
good

2590
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,720
wait for me to bring you later

2591
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,280
press the green

2592
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,160
hello teacher

2593
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,160
i want to ask

2594
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:51,240
It is in the item grown in our laboratory

2595
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,320
sometimes a light pipe

2596
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,280
Because it is a fluorescent tube

2597
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,640
So if one of the light bulbs is broken

2598
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,120
that would affect the plants

2599
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,820
Will it affect its germination rate or something?

2600
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:05,820
I think what you're asking is

2601
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,820
If it is said that some places in my growth box are relatively dark

2602
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:11,820
Some places are brighter, will it make any difference?

2603
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,820
If you say you want

2604
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:17,820
Research is a reaction to light

2605
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:20,820
We have just introduced some very typical light reactions that are related to

2606
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:22,820
say you want to measure flowering time

2607
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:24,820
You want to measure progress, growth, etc.

2608
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:26,820
That

2609
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:29,820
My suggestion is that I hope you can try your best to get what you want

2610
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:32,820
Different research groups and control groups in the experiment

2611
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:35,820
Can be placed under relatively consistent light brightness

2612
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:37,820
to experiment

2613
01:39:37,820 --> 01:39:39,820
so as not to have some appearance that you will see

2614
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:42,820
Could be because it's not getting enough light or too much light

2615
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:44,820
So maybe add more lights

2616
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:46,820
just can't pull it out

2617
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:48,820
That's because the teacher I am

2618
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:50,820
Because I put them all on the same plate

2619
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,820
so i guess they should be ok

2620
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:54,820
Just saying sometimes I find mine

2621
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:56,820
certain multium it may

2622
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:58,820
Germination rate becomes worse

2623
01:39:58,820 --> 01:40:00,820
then i don't know

2624
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,080
does this have anything to do with it

2625
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:07,080
Yes, in fact, the germination of many plants is regulated by light.

2626
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,440
So if you have observed it this thing

2627
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,160
like in fact nice

2628
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:12,640
Maybe it’s a new one in the process of transmitting light information

2629
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,760
involved in it

2630
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,400
Then you just said put them on the same plate

2631
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,480
This is of course already good

2632
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:20,600
Already in line with a situation where the environment can be unified

2633
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,440
It's actually quite simple

2634
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:25,320
Some light photometers can measure light

2635
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:26,840
So you can be in the middle of the four corners

2636
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,960
Grab a few points left and right to measure a little

2637
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:30,240
if the light

2638
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,000
I suggest maybe not too much difference

2639
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:32,880
that is close to

2640
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,480
Or you can rotate a little bit

2641
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:37,840
Allow the plant to be evenly illuminated by the light

2642
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,400
maybe ideal

2643
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,600
Thank you, teacher

2644
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,880
Talk a little bit tonight

2645
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:50,400
I want to use the leek as a metaphor

2646
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,120
Is it the same growth period

2647
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,120
Is there any difference in its nutritional value?

2648
01:40:56,120 --> 01:41:00,120
Sorry I may not be able to answer this question

2649
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
hit you

2650
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,500
Leek and Leek King are

2651
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:08,500
Maybe one belongs to the white seedlings that have not been illuminated

2652
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:11,500
Then one is an illuminated green tissue

2653
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:14,500
I'm really sorry about the nutritional value part

2654
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:17,500
Maybe it has something to do with liking

2655
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,500
Everyone has different preferences

2656
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,500
Thanks

2657
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,500
ok, the one behind

2658
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,500
Hello, Mr. Wu

2659
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,500
I want to ask you about the video I just saw

2660
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,500
His chloroplast goes towards the light

2661
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:31,500
how did he move there

2662
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:32,500
Thanks

2663
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:33,500
good

2664
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:36,500
Today just happened to be because of time I didn't have a chance

2665
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,500
Ah Xiu can show you

2666
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,500
In fact, inside the cell

2667
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:41,500
We will feel that the cells in the whole cell

2668
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,500
just like a swimming pool

2669
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:45,500
then very empty

2670
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:47,500
But in fact the inside of the cell is like when I was a child

2671
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
as fast as the swimming pool

2672
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,500
Just because there were not so many facilities back then

2673
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:53,500
So there are many people soaking in the swimming pool

2674
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,500
There is a special structure inside the cell

2675
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,500
cytoskeleton

2676
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,500
Cytoskeleton

2677
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,840
In fact, it was found that the movement of cells in the chloroplast is pulled by these cytoskeletons

2678
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,440
It is acting micro filament

2679
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:09,440
it will pull it will wrap on the chloroplast

2680
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:15,240
Then there is a directional movement by means of aggregation, polymerization and depolarization

2681
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:18,520
So if you can calibrate the position of these cytoskeletons

2682
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:21,160
you'll find it afterglow outside and pull it over

2683
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:22,660
so

2684
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,400
Sorry, the one just said that the cellular chloroplasts hide behind other chloroplasts

2685
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,640
That's who pushed the first one out

2686
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,800
Are you saying who is willing to sacrifice themselves or who

2687
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,560
who decides the first

2688
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:41,040
This might be more like fate

2689
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,920
But its original place is there

2690
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,080
and then sometimes

2691
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,320
because it might want to go back

2692
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,920
But the space is no longer allowed

2693
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,840
But it can be

2694
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:55,400
If there is a way to track a single chloroplast, I can see if there is a braver one

2695
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:57,200
Chloroplasts recommended for Yonghui

2696
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Mr. Wu, from the perspective of bionics, if the artificial plants are present, can he do the same thing as the real plants, that is, the effect of light ears?

2697
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Okay, thank you

2698
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:20,000
This is actually the goal that many people want to achieve, that is to say, I don’t want to talk about plants first, it may be more complicated

2699
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:28,000
That may mean from the smallest point, how can I create a new, that is, an artificial cell, and then be able to perform the function of a cell

2700
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Only by getting there first can we get to a plant, that is to say, like in a plant, maybe the roadside weed we just saw is very innocent, but there are tens of thousands of genes in the genome

2701
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:46,000
There are thousands of single white matter in the karma body, which need to work together to construct

2702
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:54,000
So, if what you said just now means, from things to beings, it means how I build it, using the knowledge I already know in genetics

2703
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
How to build a complete cell, or a complete plant individual

2704
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
of course

2705
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:07,420
Everyone is very interested, maybe in reproductive energy, and also hope to use the karma body as a generator, specially to manufacture the things we need

2706
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:17,120
I think there is still room for effort, because we don't fully understand the number of genes involved and its structure

2707
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:22,560
Therefore, there is no way to independently let the karma body survive in the cells alone, without combined genes

2708
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:33,420
Because now most of the proteins, most of the genes in most karma bodies, the genes that make these proteins, most of them have been sent to the cells to go through the process of internal engineering, and they have all entered the nucleus of the cells.

2709
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:38,160
So it needs the existence of the nucleus, so that the karmic body can function normally

2710
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:42,560
So there may be a way to go, but it is also a direction that many people are interested in

2711
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:44,860
child

2712
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,560
Mr. Wen, thank you very much for suddenly entering my file

2713
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,060
Thanks

2714
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:56,060
Because what you are talking about today is all about conception, it seems that from listening to your documents, it seems that conception decides to punch

2715
01:44:56,060 --> 01:45:00,060
Then I just said, does the temperature also matter?

2716
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,040
You said this flower, whether it will bloom or not

2717
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:07,640
Is that temperature also brings you a little bit of character Thank you

2718
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,440
Of course it is

2719
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,480
Especially today, here I just saw a teacher Chang

2720
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,160
He is in our agricultural and biological center, he specializes in temperature

2721
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:17,560
Wait a minute when I have no way to answer, I will

2722
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,560
ask him to help me

2723
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:20,840
It's the debit number

2724
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:23,920
That's right. I can have a discount number.

2725
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,080
That temperature is indeed

2726
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,800
For example, you still remember

2727
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:31,600
I just developed that beautiful purple flower in my academic qualifications

2728
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,400
It's actually inside and outside the petals

2729
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,080
Feel the difference in temperature

2730
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,680
That is, when the inside feels the temperature, it will grow faster

2731
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,240
So from the petals will open

2732
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,440
So the temperature in the environment is

2733
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:45,800
A very important factor in controlling plant growth

2734
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:47,280
The temperature is high and low

2735
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,160
High temperature is harmful to plants

2736
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,760
Low temperature is also a kind of damage to plants

2737
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,680
So there is a relationship between personnel and temperature

2738
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,320
Just to make us feel more comfortable

2739
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:56,920
The same is true for plants

2740
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,440
So in the environment

2741
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:59,960
I'm sorry I just had another

2742
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,400
Excessively fond of loving my own research work

2743
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,500
So I'm going to emphasize it as the only important factor in the world

2744
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,000
but you are exactly right

2745
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,400
That is, no matter the temperature in the environment

2746
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:12,800
In fact, temperature and light often interact with each other.

2747
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,200
because when the light shines

2748
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,100
The pig's body temperature rises

2749
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,700
So the eyes sometimes come together

2750
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:18,900
that temperature can also

2751
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:20,200
high daytime temperature

2752
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:21,000
low temperature at night

2753
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,700
Sometimes you don't need to deal with light

2754
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,100
Just one high temperature and one low temperature

2755
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,400
can also make living organisms always establish

2756
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,100
So the temperature is really good for pigs

2757
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:30,200
is also a very important environmental factor

2758
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:33,300
your classmate

2759
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:34,000
next is

2760
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Teacher, I want to ask

2761
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,500
Those photoblast proteins

2762
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,300
it if

2763
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:40,300
because we now need to know

2764
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,900
The climate is changing now

2765
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:44,000
It is possible that the intensity of the light

2766
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,500
will always change

2767
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:49,000
Then will it affect the mechanisms of these light-should bodies?

2768
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,200
its proportional

2769
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:54,200
change with long-term changes

2770
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,100
This is the first question

2771
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:56,400
Then the second question is

2772
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,900
just want to ask

2773
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,700
like a spitting lion

2774
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
This plant that can parasitize on others

2775
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Does he have this skinny protein?

2776
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
The second question you mentioned is also what I really want to know.

2777
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
That is to say broadly speaking

2778
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
That is to say, these parasitic plants

2779
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,000
How much of it is from others and how much is produced by himself

2780
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Then I haven't dabbled in it myself.

2781
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Just have you ever studied the synopsis itself?

2782
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Is his skinny body his own or someone else's?

2783
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Natus itself actually has a very incomplete karma body

2784
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
So he actually

2785
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:33,000
He doesn't have a lot of light-type development himself.

2786
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
So I'm thinking maybe he has some similar genes

2787
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
But I don't know if it still works

2788
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
but this should take a look

2789
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I haven't read any reports about it

2790
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Then your other question is

2791
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
In the change of light environment

2792
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Is it true that these light thin bodies of plants will also make some adjustments

2793
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
to respond to changes in the environment

2794
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Then I think the research on thin body in nature now

2795
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
has given us some temperament

2796
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
just some ideas

2797
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
so it's possible

2798
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Its stability is relatively low when it is illuminated

2799
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
For example, luciferin A

2800
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
its stability when it is illuminated

2801
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
It can't move its fingers and is very intolerant to light

2802
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
because if it is exposed to light it will be taken to magnetic therapy

2803
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
So maybe it's also possible to use this way to

2804
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
In response to the high light intensity in the environment

2805
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
It is the amount of luciferin A that will exist

2806
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
the amount will be less

2807
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
this is also a way

2808
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
It not only accepts light

2809
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
also let the light control its own amount inside the cell

2810
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
After controlling the amount it is able to receive the

2811
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
naturally less

2812
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
So take advantage of these mutual feedback

2813
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
The control mechanism can also allow

2814
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
The composition of the plant body that changes its own photoripe body

2815
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
composition and weight

2816
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
So there is an opportunity to reach

2817
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Communicate more closely with the environment

2818
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
or more delicate

2819
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
ok one last question please sir

2820
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,000
teacher ask

2821
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Short Manufacturing Plant vs. Long Manufacturing Plant

2822
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Usually a diurnal flowering plant

2823
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Plants that bloom at night

2824
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Is it also possible to stipulate

2825
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,820
conversation

2826
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:04,100
talk to

2827
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:05,760
conversation

2828
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,940
I really do not know

2829
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,020
but I

2830
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:10,240
Teacher Qiu is closer to me

2831
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,540
so i can look it up and tell her

2832
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:16,380
So if there are other questions today I don't know

2833
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,940
That is to say, you should be able to find Huiyinmiao on the Internet.

2834
01:49:18,940 --> 01:49:21,000
Also tell me the problem

2835
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,780
Then I have a chance to learn new answers

2836
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:24,580
Teacher Qiu, I will tell you when I find it

2837
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:28,420
OK I think so

2838
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:30,720
about the time

2839
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:31,580
really tired

2840
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:32,520
today i think

2841
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,080
There is a classmate who can continue

2842
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,360
influential

2843
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:38,400
Ask privately

2844
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,980
we'll call it a day

2845
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:45,580
Thank you all for coming to the stormy night

2846
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:47,620
hope everyone

2847
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,800
min GPA o Canada min GPA o Toronto

2848
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,060
you
