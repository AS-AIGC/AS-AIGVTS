1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,340
where

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Academia Sinica's February Posture Response Lectures Begin

3
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,000
We invite Wang Huijun, Vice President to host for us

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Good night, fellow friends

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I haven't been here to chair this meeting in four years

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So now it is returned by the central government

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
i'm still a little nervous

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I haven't done this for a long time

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but today is very happy

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We have invited Professor Xie Qinghe

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Also our researcher

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
come here and give us a great talk

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
His field is of course related to so-called stem cells

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
very tight matter

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So I thought this wonderfully polite

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But before this starts

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to make a teaser

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because I always forget

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In fact, there will be the next feast of knowledge in March

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It is told by our chief medical doctor

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Causes and consequences of economic inequality in Taiwan

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So this is also a topic of great concern to everyone.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I hope March 29

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Please take part

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Today I would like to introduce Professor Xie Qinghe a little

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I haven't known Professor Xie for long.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but very impressive

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In fact, Professor Xie is also an outstanding cardiologist.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So he can actually see a doctor

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's just that there is less time now

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
he spent a lot of time

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
are doing related research now

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Today's topic is also related to the heart

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Dr. Xie and Professor Xie graduated from the Department of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical College

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Go to National Taiwan University after graduation

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
After studying at National Taiwan University as a specialist doctor

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Later, it should be on this

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Went to America in 1990

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
toWashingtonUniversity

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Is that the one in Seattle?

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
from Seattle

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
because there is another

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
at Washington University in Saint Louis

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Medicine is also good

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,800
This medical school has learned some of the most advanced research related to stem cells

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,800
So he is considered a very outstanding researcher in Taiwan.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,400
We're in a national achievement program called the Biotech Medicine Program

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,400
We also set up a team related to stem cells

49
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,000
He is the leader of the big team, the leader

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,800
Therefore, it has made a great contribution to the research related to stem cells in Taiwan.

51
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:46,600
He has also won many awards, including the dismissal of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the National Science Council, etc.

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
also published quite a few papers

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,000
Many of them are in very high-end journals

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,200
He also has a very special biotechnology fund

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Foundation Award Winners

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,280
This foundation seems to give 20 million at a time

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,240
or what information

58
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,800
25 million

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
a lot of money

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,960
But give them ten years to do the research

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,480
So we look forward to having such a good environment

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,560
He is now a researcher at our biomedical institute

63
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,600
Well but also too big

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,040
This is a difficult merger professor

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,680
So since he's trying to keep his doctor's license

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
must go to the hospital to see a doctor

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,680
We don't have hospitals in Central Plains

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,120
So he still has to go to National Taiwan University to see a doctor

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Then we are like this age

70
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,600
The most concerned thing is the doctor

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,920
So we all please the doctor

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,800
because we need their care

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,120
so this

74
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,840
but the doctor

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,920
I think we Taiwanese doctors all know

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,520
are very very busy

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
He is waiting in the morning

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
A row to more than one hundred

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,080
I don't know how these doctors see a doctor

80
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,080
But he still does state-of-the-art research despite his busy schedule

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
The progress of our kind of medicine

82
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,720
does play an important role

83
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,680
So we have this anticipation today

84
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,600
Come and listen to our Professor Xie tell us about this

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,760
The Dream Chasing and Rhapsody of a Physician-Scientist

86
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,840
Regeneration

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,160
we warmly welcome

88
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Thank you very much for the introduction of the vice president

89
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,400
Thank you very much all the guests

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,120
Seniors and everyone

91
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,240
Colleagues in our hospital

92
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,960
in relatively cold

93
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,160
And it's raining again

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,320
come to our events

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The vice president politely said he would be nervous

96
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
If the deputy dean is nervous

97
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,600
Then I'm more nervous, really nervous

98
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,280
Because usually if the author in the audience

99
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,880
They are all like vice-presidents, like secretary-general and academicians.

100
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,920
Actually, I'm not nervous at all.

101
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,680
But when I found out that what the audience did was our normal

102
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,560
In fact, there are many professors here

103
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
There are also many of our left and right neighbors

104
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,400
We even came up to Peng Chang from Taichung and Kaohsiung

105
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,440
Then I just saw outside

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,760
There are many students from Jianzhong here

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm most afraid of this kind of speech

108
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,600
Because this kind of speech is usually a little difficult

109
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,560
a little challenging

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,400
How can these messages be

111
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
which we want to share with you

112
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,680
There are even some that you can let everyone know

113
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,440
Then we can even promote things together

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,480
how to convey it

115
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,680
can then cause an interaction

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's actually quite a challenge

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
probably next to a little bit

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I went to the Taichung Science and Technology Museum twice before

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Taichung Science and Technology Museum to give a science and technology speech

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Usually the audience is from 4 years old to 80 years old

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That challenge is also very high.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Later, I really wanted to say that I just brought some toys to

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
go help like this

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So today I want to introduce to you

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Regeneration

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I remember 16 years ago

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
At that time, the general manager of our former health insurance bureau once

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Professor Zhang Hongren

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He is after resigning from the Health Insurance Bureau

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
then go to harvard medical school

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
To visit a scholar like this

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He had one please at that time

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
backyard rescue over there

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
we eat together

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
everyone will chat

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He asked me what I was doing

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I said I was doing rejuvenation

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He asked me, is it possible to regenerate the mind?

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
So I still ask every day to this day

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it possible for Xinji to be alive?

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,800
It seems like a dream to me

142
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Sometimes it's about chasing your dreams

143
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,000
need to be a little fanatic like this

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
This is not madness

145
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
It really means fanatical

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
not arrogant

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So let's see today if we can

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,500
Let this new accumulation be born this big challenge

149
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,800
can be pushed forward

150
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,000
may even one day reach one of its goals

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Thank you very much Vice President just now

152
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Introduce a little background of mine

153
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
In fact, the main thing I want to share with you is

154
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I went to four medical schools after I read it

155
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Everyone knows that our medical school in Taiwan takes seven years

156
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
after seven years of medical school

157
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,800
It took two years to carry out the national duty

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
Obligation to serve as a soldier

159
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
five years of residency

160
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
So another seven years

161
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
know after seven years

162
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
So that's what heart surgery is all about.

163
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Then come to the United States to study BHD

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
do doctoral research

165
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Add up exactly seven years

166
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
then come back after

167
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
City University

168
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,000
From assistant researcher to associate researcher

169
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Assistant Professor Associate Professor to Professor

170
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,340
another seven years

171
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,140
I think being a professor is actually learning.

172
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,740
really like a student

173
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,340
So seventy percent and four equal twenty-eight

174
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,240
So until now it seems like

175
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Seems like a student

176
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,840
See if there is any way I can help others like this

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,640
good

178
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,280
That's because the topic is a

179
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,480
How do physician-scientists pursue this dream

180
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
So I will simply introduce to you

181
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,280
i grow up

182
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,480
And the process of chasing dreams like this

183
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,480
usually means

184
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
after medical school

185
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,480
We now have more and more young

186
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,680
friend young schoolboy sister

187
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,280
they will want to study and do research

188
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,640
In the education of our medical schools in Taiwan

189
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,180
Generally speaking, there is a lack of basic research

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Abroad is a little different

191
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,800
so everyone will meet

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm often asked a question that says

193
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,300
if he is interested in research

194
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,960
want to go to that doctor

195
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,800
Do you want to go out after graduating from a college?

196
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Or do you go out after your residency?

197
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,460
There are pros and cons to each

198
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,460
Because I left after graduating from college

199
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,760
Of course younger

200
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,660
But if you want to come back to Taiwan

201
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,620
After you get your Ph.D., you will do research and then come back.

202
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,660
already old

203
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,460
Becoming a resident doctor may not be enough

204
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,260
So this is something to consider

205
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,160
But if you say that you finished your residency in Taiwan

206
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,960
Our cumulative experience is good

207
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,300
But I haven't been a student for more than ten years since I left

208
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,000
It's hard work being a student again

209
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,300
So there are pros and cons to each

210
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,000
Just look at each person's situation and make a trade-off

211
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,800
clinical

212
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,160
So I'm staying as a resident

213
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,300
After that, after getting a specialist

214
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,300
Then the next question is to say

215
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,500
Then I will continue to be an attending physician

216
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,460
Or do I chase my dreams

217
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,460
Go abroad to study for a doctorate

218
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,760
Then choose to go out

219
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,300
because it really is one

220
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,960
It's been like this since I was a child

221
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,120
good

222
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,880
then i choose

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,540
Seattle

224
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,040
Go to Utter Mission Wash's business project to go to this field

225
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,800
It was so simple when I thought about it

226
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,800
Because there are actually a lot of implantable medical devices in Xinzang Surgery

227
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,000
You may have heard of artificial escorts

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Vascular Stent

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
artificial blood vessels

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
even an artificial heart

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And the well-known Yekemo

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Is Ye Kemo Doctor Ye?

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Not a doctor surnamed Ye

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yekemo is an instrument doing extracorporeal circulation

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
These things are business engineering people

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
develop it for clinical use

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
However, although these have been used clinically for decades

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
it has some problems

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
we hope to make it better

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So I wanted to say

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If I can combine engineering to do biomedical research

242
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
may be helpful

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So this is the time to choose

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Reasons to study bioengineering

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then Dr.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
When I'm about to get my Ph.D.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
But once I came back to National Taiwan University to give a speech

248
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,340
Then my teacher, Professor Lin Fangyi, said

249
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,740
do you want to come back

250
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,840
At that time I thought

251
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,500
Seems like I learned a little bit by doing research

252
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,040
I want to be doing a lot of seniors are

253
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,000
have more experience than me

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,540
I just started reading

255
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,140
After entering the laboratory, I found out that

256
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,540
In fact, doing research is not so simple

257
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,040
as if we

258
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,740
When Dr. Zhu Yuan wants to learn to be a surgeon

259
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,640
At the beginning, you must start by learning to brush your hands first.

260
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,540
Avoid infection by brushing hands

261
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,500
Then you start sewing the skin

262
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,200
Slowly start cutting the fence

263
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,000
nothing to do with that politics

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,400
Start with the simplest operation

265
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,700
Then slowly start to dye until the end like this

266
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
In fact, doing research is like this

267
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
wait a minute before we continue

268
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
So I feel like my PhD is not enough

269
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
So I went to Boston

270
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,200
go do boso research

271
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,500
After doing that, the next question is to say

272
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,800
Do I stay in the U.S. to find a job or do I come back?

273
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,500
Then I chose to come back

274
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,960
good

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,440
Why did you go this way?

276
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,960
In fact, there are still some antecedents and consequences

277
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040
there is usually some reason for everything

278
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
There are some steps into the group

279
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,560
i liked it when i was young

280
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,920
likes to shake

281
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,040
I like doing things by hand, I don't like studying

282
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,680
my wife will find it strange

283
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,640
You don't seem to like doing housework that much at home

284
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
you would love to move when you were a kid

285
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,840
Actually, I really like to move my hands and feet.

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I just like to do things with my hands

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,400
When I was a student

288
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,760
I seem to be doing pretty well in the lab classes.

289
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,960
When it comes time to memorize

290
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,480
my grades are not good

291
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,400
So this is also natural

292
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm going for surgery

293
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,440
Will undergo cardiac surgery because

294
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
In my fourth year of medical school

295
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
One of them went to Chang Gung Hospital as an intern

296
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,600
I saw Professor Zhang Zhaoxiong, the then president of Chang Gung Hospital

297
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
he is undergoing open heart surgery

298
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,840
i feel amazing

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,160
i adore him so much

300
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,160
I find it amazing that

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
a heart is beating

302
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,200
Our technology through extracorporeal circulation

303
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,160
freeze this heart heart paralysis

304
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,700
stop the heart

305
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,440
then open the heart

306
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,840
after getting hands and feet inside

307
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
This heart problem can be mended

308
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,340
Then bring the temperature back up

309
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,600
swim the blood back

310
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,500
heart beats again

311
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,240
and after closing the chest

312
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
can solve this problem

313
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,960
To me it's really a miraculous thing

314
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,500
So I thought I'd go with this one

315
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,000
At that time, it was actually quite large

316
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But then I really went this way

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,300
But once you walk in

318
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,000
Until I finished my clinical training at National Taiwan University

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,460
just feel like saying

320
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,860
This life is really wonderful

321
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,500
why

322
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Because in fact when I

323
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Every day we have to fight with life

324
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,060
It may be hard for you guys to imagine us

325
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,260
now everyone is talking

326
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,420
your working hours

327
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,420
Then we have to fight for this leisure time and so on.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,560
The previous training of Xinjiang Surgery may still be the same now

329
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,880
Even Saturdays and Sundays are all counted as holidays

330
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,180
The average work day is 16 hours

331
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,040
So it is very common to work continuously for more than 30 hours

332
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,380
It is also common to have to fight with life and death every day

333
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,460
sometimes we can

334
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,240
save our patients

335
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,560
But sometimes we just can't be that good

336
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,600
some patients we lose them

337
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,400
usually means

338
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,260
How we lost these patients we probably all know why

339
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,560
So we want to say that we have the opportunity to do better in the future

340
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,180
But sometimes even if we feel that the patient may not have a chance, he probably

341
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,960
maybe we can't save him

342
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,280
He can ride a mech again

343
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,800
rescued by us

344
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,080
it's weird

345
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,400
Losing patients sometimes we don't know very well

346
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,160
sometimes

347
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,480
Rescue the patient We are not so clear why we can save him

348
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,520
so feel like saying

349
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,560
I am really in awe of life, there are many

350
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,840
what we don't know

351
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,600
So I'm wondering if there's a way we can learn more about

352
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Because usually the more you know about a thing

353
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,660
Even a scientific study is the same

354
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,000
The more you understand why it's what it's mechanism

355
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,100
then you might have a better chance

356
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,760
better treatments can be devised to help it

357
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
it was a simple idea

358
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,460
So I went to America

359
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,220
then i'm in seattle

360
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,500
So everyone, Seattle is on the northwest side of the United States.

361
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,860
It’s very close to Taiwan, and you can get there by direct flight from EVA Air.

362
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,160
Then just like when we were young

363
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,860
Many have the same experience, the same dream

364
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,360
It is said that many campuses in the United States are very beautiful.

365
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,660
That's some views of Seattle like this

366
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,720
I want to say everyone come here after dinner

367
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,360
Just to show you some pretty pictures

368
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,920
So this is the Space Needle, everyone knows it better.

369
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,280
that's mount rainier

370
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,580
this is a national park

371
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,360
That's some scenery of the school

372
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,580
So you can also see cherry blossoms in spring

373
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,780
In autumn, you can watch the windy night

374
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,160
really can see

375
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,820
But it's beautiful

376
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,280
In fact, it was quite painful at the beginning of the doctoral program.

377
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,820
is crying beautifully

378
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
it's been like this

379
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
the first one

380
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,900
Although I am a graduate of medical school

381
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,900
Then also did clinical

382
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,000
Actually I'm interested in some biomedical stuff

383
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,900
It's all old stuff

384
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,500
Study something every day and keep improving

385
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,300
So I haven't attended school in more than ten years

386
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,600
not that long

387
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,000
Haven't attended school for many years

388
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,100
Then go back to school all of a sudden

389
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
It's actually quite hard work

390
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,600
Again in a person who doesn't understand much English

391
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
then long gone is

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
because i used to

393
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,200
In our time, it was probably not bad to read and read.

394
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
Can't hear well

395
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,200
I can't write well

396
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,300
So I was afraid that when I first met a professor in the United States, I would

397
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,100
hard to hear

398
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,700
i don't know what he's talking about

399
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,900
He doesn't know what I'm talking about

400
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,000
So I took my wife to be an interpreter like this

401
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I still have a clear impression

402
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,100
But we are pushing our three month old

403
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,000
we are called boss

404
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
Then take my wife to be an interpreter like this

405
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
to avoid

406
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,400
Difficulties in communication start like this

407
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,900
Then

408
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,800
You still have to take a lot of courses in the first year

409
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,100
to fix something like

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,500
Like the five-character class in the Department of Electrical Engineering

411
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,000
It's the kind of master's degree in electrical engineering.

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,300
Courses currently being taken in doctoral programs

413
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm ashamed to tell you

414
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Especially the architectural degree here

415
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,400
When I was in my PhD class last year

416
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,300
I even forgot about the ohm force

417
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
But he went to take the five-character course in the Department of Electrical Engineering

418
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,800
So it's a big challenge

419
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,200
Generally business engineering

420
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,700
Even you have to learn biology

421
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,800
Engineering also needs to be learned

422
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,000
So take a bunch of classes

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
Take forty or fifty students

424
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Then you have to test a lot of things

425
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,400
before graduation

426
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
But after a few years

427
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,900
Seventy to eighty hours a week

428
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,200
time work

429
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,400
twenty to

430
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,300
Twenty to thirty hours a week

431
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,900
results that can be lost at home

432
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,700
i'm lucky

433
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,200
I graduated in four years and two months

434
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,800
Then I want to thank my vice

435
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,600
my colleagues

436
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,300
And my wife and my wife's mother look like this

437
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,500
Because of our years in Seattle

438
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
he went eight times

439
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,900
we have weight

440
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Anyway, if there is weight, pull him to help

441
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,200
and our aunt

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,500
what does my doctoral class do

443
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
because my teacher is

444
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,100
There are many stories about my teacher

445
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
can speak for two hours

446
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,000
but basically

447
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
He's also a Harper's surgeon

448
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,900
But he spends 70% of his time doing research

449
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,400
So he is actually at the University of Washington, which is independent in West Asia

450
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,800
He established the entire surgical research system

451
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,900
At the time this was very rare

452
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
To this day, few surgeons can do this

453
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,300
he uses a

454
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,900
Use the lungs

455
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,500
A model of this kind of collar from part of the lungs

456
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,300
to experiment

457
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,100
what experiment

458
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,500
Because we do bypass surgery for artificial blood vessels

459
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,900
or a stent for blood vessels

460
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The problem that will be encountered is the blood vessel

461
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,700
Although you opened it up

462
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,300
But you artificial things

463
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,000
foreign body reaction

464
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,100
so it's like saying your hand was cut with a knife

465
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,300
it will heal in the wound

466
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
But it heals the wound too much

467
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,800
So some weird scars

468
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,700
artificial blood vessel

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
artificial stent placed in blood vessel

470
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,760
These tissues will also grow

471
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,400
Finally, the blood vessel is blocked again

472
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,640
I came to find out

473
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,800
if you can increase

474
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,040
When the blood flow of this artificial blood vessel

475
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,160
then you can

476
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,440
grow this out

477
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,760
These tissues inside the artificial blood vessel

478
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,240
it can be retracted again

479
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,240
So again blood flow can be suggested

480
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,160
how to do this

481
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,720
How can this make the blood flow in the blood vessels faster?

482
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,800
For example, our person

483
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,080
This is boiling is this part

484
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,400
its aorta to the arteries of both feet

485
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,800
We connect its two artificial blood vessels

486
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,680
tie it in the middle

487
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,120
So the blood can only go this way

488
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,200
after those two months

489
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,080
It will grow a lot of intima tissue

490
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,920
At this time, if we are in a remote place

491
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,920
Connect its arteries and veins

492
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,600
We all know that normally our arteries go to the vascular

493
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,520
Will it reach the vein?

494
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,280
Then the way I use surgery now

495
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,160
connect it directly

496
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,600
You can let the blood run here and run straight over

497
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,960
it's like saying

498
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Originally, there were only three lanes on one side of the expressway.

499
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,880
You suddenly turn it into a six-lane lane

500
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
The draw will definitely speed up

501
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,000
What about the blood flow speeding up?

502
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,720
It will make the growing tissue shrink again

503
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
retracted again

504
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,920
then you tie this side up

505
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,920
it grows again

506
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,160
So its organization is actually scalable.

507
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,820
ok now here comes the problem

508
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,560
If there is a patient today

509
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,120
His artificial blood vessel is about to become blocked.

510
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
You say sorry to him

511
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,360
I let you open one

512
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,160
Open a Tokyo Mailou tube surgery

513
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,520
I can make you shrink back

514
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,720
Does the patient want you to do it?

515
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,160
Of course not

516
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,720
probably no one would

517
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,680
So all we have to do is say

518
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,040
if i could know say

519
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,640
This increase in blood flow

520
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,520
Why do these tissues grow

521
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,440
retracted words

522
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,140
then i can know

523
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,180
What are the things that I can design drugs for?

524
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,840
to do something similar

525
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
Then we can use drugs

526
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,040
to simulate the effect of this increased blood flow

527
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,040
We often do research in this way

528
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,440
It's us who bully animals

529
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,680
bully them and do some

530
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,440
things that happened that they shouldn't have

531
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,440
learn from it

532
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Thanks also to their students

533
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So we can learn to say

534
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Maybe how can we diagnose a disease earlier

535
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
how to get better treatment

536
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Then after finishing his Ph.D., he went to Doctorate to be a postdoctoral fellow.

537
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We have been to Doctorston

538
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You can also see this is the view of Temi

539
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Halwegen MIT looks like this

540
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But for us

541
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
In fact, it is this thing that affects us the most.

542
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
i hope there are not too many

543
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
yangjid fans

544
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
me and my wife

545
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
because the year we went

546
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Year 2003

547
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
end of 2003

548
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
year 2004

549
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
All year 2004

550
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
He just breaks that Bamber's Cube

551
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is the curse

552
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Won another world championship after 1984

553
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
so i appreciate him

554
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So my wife and I decided

555
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We're going to be Saffron fans for life

556
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So when I got back, I joked

557
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
if you are a yangjid fan

558
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
better not come into my office like this

559
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,160
But didn't Wang Jianming go to Yangji later?

560
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,280
That's right, when Wang Jianming pitches the ball

561
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,680
yangji can win

562
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,800
When Wang Jianming is not pitching

563
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,560
better not win

564
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,800
From the time of postdoctoral

565
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,840
Start to learn how to make stem cells

566
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,400
How to make these nanotechnology

567
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
That's because I came back later

568
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,440
This year is the tenth year in Taiwan

569
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,560
Our time is more than nine years

570
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,520
What I have done in the tenth year is related to this context.

571
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,280
So I'll just go straight to what we're doing in this space

572
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,960
good

573
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,280
Before we start talking about regeneration

574
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,280
I would like to introduce a very interesting research

575
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,960
I like to share with you

576
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
This is a cross-border cooperation between the United States and Egypt

577
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,800
what to do

578
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,880
Here is the mummy of an Egyptian 3,000 years ago

579
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,800
It's a princess mummy

580
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,240
get the mummy out

581
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,000
Whole-body computed tomography scan

582
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
that can be seen very white

583
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,960
brighter ones

584
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,840
It's where the arteriosclerosis is

585
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,640
The one on the right is a modern Egyptian

586
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,440
It's the same as doing a full-body computerized tomography examination.

587
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,440
same white as this

588
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,940
They all represent places where arteriosclerosis is covered

589
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,640
You can see that

590
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,500
From the aorta of our heart, the spectator artery, to

591
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,640
From the aorta in our abdomen to the two feet these branches

592
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,140
In fact, the gap of three thousand years

593
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,980
did not cause much change in the disease of arteriosclerosis

594
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,440
That is to say, even after three thousand years of evolution

595
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,980
The disease is still

596
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,380
i joked

597
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,140
If our air continues to deteriorate like it has these days

598
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
Can human beings live on the earth for another 3,000 years?

599
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
may be a problem

600
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,180
but if you can

601
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,940
After 3000 years, we will take people out to make

602
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,480
Whole body computerized tomography scan

603
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
maybe still like this

604
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,100
In other words, arteriosclerosis is actually an ancient disease.

605
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,940
It's not like this today because everyone eats well

606
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
OK

607
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,400
So what's the problem with hardening?

608
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,400
If this blood vessel hardens, it will become narrower and narrower

609
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,400
The blood cannot run through, or even be blocked.

610
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,400
If we block our brains, we will have a stroke

611
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Myocardial infarction

612
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,600
If the feet are blocked, the feet will turn black

613
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,400
If the intestines are blocked, the intestines will turn black

614
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
OK

615
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,800
What happens in the heart is what we call a myocardial infarction

616
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Then I often remind my friends

617
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,600
In Taiwan we are all cultural cancer

618
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,200
We all know that cancer is the number one cause of death in Taiwan

619
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,600
we all know that

620
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
But that's all cancers added up

621
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,800
If we look at individual organs

622
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,600
The heart is still the single organ that kills the most people in the country

623
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Please keep this in mind for a chance to encourage heart research like this

624
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Then if it is because of the main color of the arteries

625
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,720
cause myocardial necrosis

626
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,420
Our heart itself doesn't regenerate very well

627
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,920
Everyone may know this

628
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,220
Necrotic myocardium will slowly fibrosis

629
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
It will be like the gray and white place here

630
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,600
This red one is our special dyeing

631
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,820
叫Tricon Staining

632
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,620
live cardiac tissue

633
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,220
still dyed red

634
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:26,100
fibrotic, hardened

635
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,820
The myocardium without function will turn grayish white

636
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,140
You can see that I used another cartoon instead

637
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,140
That is to say, the position of myocardial necrosis

638
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
it gradually becomes thinner

639
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,780
become thinner

640
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,940
But our hearts keep saying

641
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,340
The heart is the hardest working organ in our body

642
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,020
From when you were inside your mother's womb

643
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,740
it starts jumping

644
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,120
ten weeks it started jumping

645
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,820
skip till you are born skip till you grow up

646
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,620
Jump to you one day getting old enough to go away

647
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,480
it keeps jumping

648
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,240
jumping all the time

649
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,840
can't stop

650
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
In the process of shrinking and jumping

651
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,600
it will get thinner for this

652
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
Compare

653
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,240
Relatively less powerful

654
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,200
That mind-blowing pair creates pressure

655
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
so it pushes it

656
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,600
let it bash out

657
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,000
If you slam it, it will pull the more normal scheming

658
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
cause secondary damage

659
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
So this heart will slowly grow bigger and bigger

660
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,000
getting bigger and bigger

661
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,600
become not only bigger but also thinner

662
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,200
So the heart can contract like this

663
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,200
That's because of partial heart attack

664
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,400
one day it will be like this

665
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,800
Shrinkage agent is weak

666
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Books and chapters have no strength

667
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,400
So this is actually true of one of our patient's chest s-lights

668
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Everyone has had chest s-rays

669
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,200
The shaded part of white is the patient's heart

670
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,800
If you have any impression, remember

671
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,600
Go back and compare the S light you made

672
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,000
You know your heart is probably like this

673
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,360
For this patient, we usually calculate the ratio of chest enlargement and heart reduction

674
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,560
This patient has probably reached 85% to almost 90%

675
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,360
We normal people are usually only about 50%

676
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,460
So when a heart is so dirty

677
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,960
he can only be like this

678
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,660
So you can imagine if this patient can go for a jog

679
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,160
is there a way to go up and down the stairs

680
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,460
There's not even a way he can just lie on the bed and ship

681
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,960
even if he started with a localized heart problem

682
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,460
How can we help such a patient?

683
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,960
Do you want to guess what there is a thing over here?

684
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,460
This is called a war machine

685
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,760
difibrator

686
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,260
Because this patient is normally like this

687
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
he's become like this now

688
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,460
sometimes he's like this

689
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,860
what to do at this time

690
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,560
Hurry up pad

691
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,760
or to press

692
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,560
to do CPR

693
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Otherwise the patient will rest immediately

694
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
please remember

695
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
If you encounter such a situation around you

696
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
someone exposed

697
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
you feel his pulse in the neck

698
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
don't touch your hands touch your neck

699
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The neck is the most clearly palpable

700
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
if you can't feel your pulse

701
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
don't do anything

702
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Don't go to the Human Services Association, don't rush him

703
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
direct pressure

704
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
it's ok

705
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
but first thing

706
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What is CPR first thing

707
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
right

708
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Call help

709
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
hurry up

710
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Hurry up and call 119

711
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
call for help

712
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Not mouth to mouth or pressure

713
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
neither

714
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The first thing in CPR is called call help

715
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
find someone to help

716
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
then press

717
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
The latest concept

718
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
you don't need artificial respiration

719
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Just keep pressing, pressing, pressing

720
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Just push until someone comes to help.

721
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
don't mess with electricity

722
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
If you can feel his pulse

723
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
you don't need electricity

724
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Because he was still dancing normally

725
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
He might be finished after being shocked by you.

726
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
so don't mess with electricity

727
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I will remind you every time

728
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Because our children's elementary school used to be

729
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The principal of the primary school asked me

730
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,800
Everything needs to be placed where the electrical appliances should be placed.

731
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,200
sometimes it's better not to let go

732
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,860
It's actually dangerous

733
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Such patients we

734
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,220
Usually that's the way to help him

735
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,520
heart transplant

736
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,120
But we don't have that many hearts to transplant

737
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,120
especially in taiwan

738
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,160
so

739
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,020
Even today, there are one hundred patients waiting for patients with heart disease at National Taiwan University Hospital every day.

740
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,560
come help

741
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,900
Every day, 150 people in Taiwan are waiting for heart surgery to save their lives

742
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,460
We don't have that many hearts to suffer from

743
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,260
But these patients are still poor

744
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,060
Don't you think he has only one patient and he's affecting the whole family

745
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,180
When there are a hundred families with this patient saying he affects a community or even a

746
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,460
nation

747
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,520
it's actually serious

748
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,580
So what we want to be able to do is is there a way

749
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,620
we can

750
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,640
I just said

751
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,480
After 3,000 years, people may still have sexual arousal

752
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,520
we knew he would be like this

753
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,080
But we hope he doesn't change like this

754
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
or at least not like this

755
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,560
No patient like this will come in for a new operation

756
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,600
How to do it

757
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,400
There may be several ways

758
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,920
First

759
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,500
Let's protect the heart muscle early

760
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,520
because

761
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,060
After the blood vessel is blocked

762
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,380
Myocardial hypoxia-ischemia

763
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,180
Myocardial necrosis may occur immediately

764
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,240
Taiwan's medical system is actually very good.

765
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,560
Don't worry about whether the country's finances can afford it

766
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,600
It's really one of our biggest

767
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,360
one

768
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,920
The people's welfare, I'm honest

769
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,200
Of course some people have to be sacrificed

770
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,800
Only by sacrificing some talents can we say that Taiwan's medical quality is good, convenient and cheap

771
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,360
People must be sacrificed, otherwise there is no such good thing in the world

772
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,660
Sacrificial groups include

773
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,460
Standing in front of this one like this

774
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,520
ignore him

775
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,040
now in taiwan

776
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,880
All we can do is patients with myocardial infarction

777
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,920
sent to emergency room

778
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,940
after

779
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,280
He was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction, and his blood vessels must be opened within 90 minutes.

780
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,340
you can hit

781
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,560
Thrombotropic Drugs

782
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,860
You can also go straight to a new catheter

783
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,400
You can put the bracket

784
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,700
but within 90 minutes

785
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,500
It is necessary to complete this operation

786
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,800
this process

787
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,200
Why? Because after a myocardial infarction

788
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,800
Only 4 hours to 6 hours

789
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,100
It can be used to protect the heart muscle

790
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,700
beyond this time

791
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,900
What I'm doing may be superfluous

792
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,100
it doesn't help much

793
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,200
So this is to protect the heart muscle early

794
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,800
OK

795
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,900
the second one

796
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,800
if we...

797
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,900
because it is an ischemic

798
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,100
hypoxia problem

799
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,000
blood vessel problem

800
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,100
So if we can do therapeutic

801
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,300
increase its blood vessels

802
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
grow more blood vessels

803
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,700
Of course it will help the function of the heart

804
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,400
The third

805
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,100
you know its dead part

806
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,500
will eventually become thinner and thinner

807
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,000
If you can punch it in and inject some material

808
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,700
some business material

809
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,200
or drugs

810
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,700
can make this mind coin

811
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,400
Even if it is necrotic it will not thin

812
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Then it can maintain its strength

813
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,500
so the heart can sustain it to continue the surgery

814
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,000
won't be beaten

815
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
then if it has thinned

816
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
but not too big

817
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,000
then we can do...

818
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,500
is to make a whole heart muscle

819
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,840
It's like we're mending clothes

820
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
patch it to the outside of the heart

821
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,500
Let it contract with the heart

822
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,500
You guys think I'm talking about cartoons

823
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,000
Taiwanese called official card

824
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,500
In fact, all these are being done

825
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,700
We are all doing it

826
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,460
Many people all over the world are doing

827
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,900
I will take some examples today

828
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,960
Everyone for reference

829
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,460
The other one is actually our favorite

830
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,000
This is our unique trick

831
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,460
Although we were the first to do

832
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,460
prove this thing

833
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,460
That is to say, it is supplementing the five types of animals

834
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,460
Including mice, including humans, of course

835
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,460
In fact, after our heart muscle is damaged

836
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,460
It triggers in our body

837
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,960
endogenous stem cells

838
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,960
it goes to where this damaged heart muscle

839
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
to regenerate

840
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,120
it grows some cardiomyocytes

841
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,880
but few

842
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,960
So however we are the first to prove that

843
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,920
really have this thing

844
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,580
Of course there's one thing that's going to happen on Earth

845
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,420
just not enough

846
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
then once you understand it

847
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
you can find ways to stimulate

848
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
make it more

849
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
if this never happened

850
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
you have to make something out of nothing

851
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
probably more difficult

852
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
So all we have to do is

853
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
how to find this

854
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Where are the endogenous stem cells?

855
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
how it is activated

856
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
is there a way to take a medicine

857
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
can make this regenerative ability stronger

858
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Ours is actually our favorite

859
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
its spontaneous endogeneity

860
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
original ability to regenerate

861
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Okay, then I will mainly introduce to you today.

862
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
three things

863
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
The first is our endogenous stem cells

864
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
how to regenerate heart muscle

865
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The second one is to tell you

866
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
How can we use tissue engineering

867
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Combining biomedicine and engineering

868
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Three ways to help the heart repair and regenerate

869
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
the third one

870
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
recent news

871
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
The news is a little louder

872
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
How do we use wearing stem cells

873
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
or induced pluripotent stem cells

874
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
These early stem cells come from

875
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
cardiomyocytes

876
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
and then let it become mature cardiomyocytes

877
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We can use it for drug picking

878
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
able to be used for treatment

879
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
I'll start with the endogenous relationship package

880
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
everyone look at this

881
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I think most people may not understand

882
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Even explaining to the professor three times in medicine

883
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,000
He doesn't necessarily know how to listen and tell the truth

884
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,720
so i just jump over

885
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,760
But I tell you, please believe me

886
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Now that you're here, you just have to trust me

887
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,600
We really have a group of endogenous relationship packages in us

888
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,200
Can go to regenerate scheming

889
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
what did we do

890
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,320
we found that

891
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,560
This is of course a mouse

892
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,920
We all love using mice for animal models

893
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,280
Not because mice are easy to bully

894
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,760
It means that the mouse is one of the five types of animals

895
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,240
Then we make transgenic mice

896
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,200
A lot of people around the world do it and we do it too

897
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,680
So the transgenic mouse

898
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,080
Transgenic mice are easier to make

899
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,920
So let's take it and make our animal model

900
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,520
If in mice we can see good results

901
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,480
then we'll jump up

902
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,480
Larger animals even become humans

903
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
So the mouse is actually more

904
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,200
that contributed a lot

905
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,300
Of course I'm talking about rats, experimental animals.

906
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,600
It's not the rats that come and go in your house.

907
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,400
not the same

908
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,300
We use a more complex gene rotor mouse model

909
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,800
first time to prove that

910
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,000
After myocardial infarction in mice

911
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Parts with necrosis and parts without necrosis

912
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,860
We call this the middle ground

913
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,960
It will be a place where the stem cells are most active

914
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,860
15% of stem cells grow new heart muscle

915
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,800
to fix it

916
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,700
Then you will think that 15% is a lot.

917
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,300
yeah 15% is a lot

918
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,500
But it's only around the necrosis

919
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,160
that small circle around

920
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,900
That lap is 15%

921
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,400
Going outside leaves only 5%, 7% or even nothing

922
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,860
So it's definitely not enough for the whole heart

923
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,260
So we want to say how can we

924
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,160
Find out where these endogenous stem cells come from

925
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,800
then we can stimulate it

926
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,860
Let it generate more new muscle regeneration

927
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,000
Then this study started when I was waiting for Boss

928
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and then later

929
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
two PhD students

930
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,720
Welcome Zhang and American side Jasmin

931
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
they all graduated

932
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,920
Jasmin is currently working as a postdoctoral fellow in Germany

933
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,240
Welcome to Zhang Zai, former president of the State Council

934
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,160
Experimenters I can know as postdoctoral fellows

935
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
They did the first study

936
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,840
Just do this study

937
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,120
that is

938
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,200
After myocardial infarction in mice

939
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,800
How does he have an endogenous dry bag to regenerate heart muscle

940
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,280
how long does he need

941
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,880
what time is the most important

942
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,640
So we did a very simple experiment

943
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,480
After myocardial infarction in mice

944
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,520
Seven days Ten days Fourteen days Twenty-one days Twenty-eight days

945
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,520
Fifty-six days to eighty-four days to three months

946
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,560
Let's talk about this dry bag

947
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,600
How to regenerate heart muscle

948
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,000
Our original thought was

949
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,440
a little every day a little every day

950
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
15% in the end

951
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
Surprisingly, it was found

952
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,440
Actually not like this

953
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,320
seven days

954
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,720
There is a clear dry package that regenerates the myocardium

955
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,440
It's over in ten days

956
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,760
you've been waiting for no more

957
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,360
Dry pack regenerates heart muscle

958
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,600
This is actually an interesting result

959
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,160
What do you guys think of a picture like this

960
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,760
That's seven days and ten days

961
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,960
But do you know how much time we spent on this picture

962
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,160
Eighteen million five years to get this result

963
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,960
I won't talk about the details anymore.

964
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,960
Then we found out that since it will be so soon

965
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,960
Stem cells are primed after cell suffocation

966
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,200
So what is the signal and what mechanism to stimulate it?

967
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,200
you will want to say

968
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,640
What happened to Xinji infarction

969
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,760
What happened when your hand was cut with a knife?

970
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,600
What happens if your hand is cut with a knife?

971
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,720
It hurts, of course it hurts

972
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,640
redness hot pain

973
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,960
The inflammatory reaction we are talking about is redness, swelling, heat, pain

974
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,840
red why red

975
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,160
Of course the first blood will be red

976
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
But if you have tissues in your body, you will dirty a lot of capillaries

977
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,320
so it will be red

978
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,160
why is it swollen

979
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,040
Because the blood vessel ruptures, the tissue will come out

980
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,560
If blood comes out, it will swell

981
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,640
it's hot why is it hot

982
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,960
because its partial like

983
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,300
It can only be repaired, so it will be hot

984
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
Why does it hurt?

985
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,500
because of the pressure on the nerve

986
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,000
or you release a lot of tissue

987
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,500
it stimulates your peripheral nerves

988
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
so you will hurt

989
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
OK as long as the body is injured

990
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,000
You will be red, hot, painful and inflamed

991
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,500
Myocardial infarction too

992
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
So when we take medicine

993
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,700
to suppress your inflammatory response

994
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,700
You won't be in pain, you won't be red, swollen and hot

995
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,000
But you also suppress your relationship package

996
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,300
It just won't come out, there's no heart muscle regeneration

997
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,300
OK

998
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,500
OK, so if we use

999
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
you suppress the inflammatory response

1000
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Relationship package won't come out

1001
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,800
then if i stimulate it

1002
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,200
make it more inflammatory

1003
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Will more related packages come out?

1004
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
Really, but you have to stimulate the right

1005
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,200
you need to give the right medicine

1006
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,500
Giving the wrong medicine won't help

1007
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,500
Then we found that there is a prostaglandin E2

1008
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,000
called PGE2

1009
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,700
It can stimulate more stem packs

1010
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,800
can become cardiomyocytes

1011
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,000
From 15% to 20%

1012
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
then next

1013
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,040
The problem is that we usually do mice

1014
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,640
It's all done with young mice

1015
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,540
Because it's cheaper, faster, and simpler

1016
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,000
But we know patients who say they will have a myocardial infarction

1017
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,640
In fact, they are relatively older

1018
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,840
Although I also recently heard

1019
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,000
An 18-year-old had a myocardial infarction

1020
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,640
It is true that age has declined

1021
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,840
but generally speaking

1022
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,000
Most common myocardial infarction patients are older

1023
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,640
Of course we have to use older ones for mice

1024
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,200
Surprisingly, we found that

1025
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,640
older mice

1026
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
It's normal after a myocardial infarction

1027
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Its stem cells will not regenerate heart muscle

1028
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,740
But if you put our PGE2

1029
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,640
The limit of this potential can be punched in

1030
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,140
It can restore the same ability as when it was young

1031
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,840
15% of myocardium's ability to regenerate

1032
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,680
This experiment is actually very important

1033
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,980
British all over the world

1034
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:56,280
The President of the New University Association came to Taiwan to give a speech

1035
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,920
He also helped us publicize that this great strength is really important.

1036
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,020
why is it important

1037
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,400
because he told us

1038
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,600
You worry that when people are getting older and older

1039
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,040
Are the stem cells gone?

1040
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,040
Or stem cells don't work

1041
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
It looks like this

1042
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,240
But after stimulating us with drugs

1043
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,040
In fact, stem cells still work

1044
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,640
This represents two meanings

1045
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,680
The first one even though older

1046
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,440
Stem cells are still there

1047
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,840
there is still hope

1048
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,080
It's not that when you get older

1049
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,000
it's still there

1050
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,600
But it may be affected by some volitional factor

1051
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,440
hold it down

1052
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,040
Make these stem cells useless

1053
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,300
So if you can unravel the mystery

1054
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,640
Allow stem cells to regain their ability

1055
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,200
Then we can regenerate the new machine

1056
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,440
PG-2 is one of those that can do such a job

1057
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,600
PG-2 is a drug that mainly removes

1058
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,800
factor of our aging

1059
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,200
One of them is called TGF-Fatalone

1060
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,000
Pressure-free is not very familiar with these

1061
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,200
it doesn't matter you know

1062
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,400
Anyway, there are many genes

1063
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,200
this is one of the genes

1064
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,000
So PG-2 Treatment can

1065
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,300
Beta this Cinema of TG in the aging heart

1066
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
hold it down

1067
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,500
So the lid cell can regain its ability to regenerate

1068
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,300
So if we directly give

1069
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,300
This drug that inhibits the beta of TG

1070
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,900
we can restore some degree of

1071
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,800
Scheming regenerated in the old you mouse

1072
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So, if there are friends from the pharmacy here,

1073
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
you will know

1074
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
There are at least two things that can be developed

1075
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Drugs for Cardiac Regeneration

1076
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
One is called Pg2

1077
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,200
One called TGβ1

1078
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,500
Right, that is it

1079
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,500
The next question is

1080
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Where did these stem cells come from?

1081
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,500
Most of the stem cells are actually in the heart

1082
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
from the heart

1083
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,500
It wouldn't move

1084
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,500
then you stimulate it

1085
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
it will start to work

1086
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,000
But there is one thing everyone agrees on

1087
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But there is one thing that everyone has been controversial about.

1088
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Tonic in the bone marrow

1089
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
or blood circulation

1090
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,500
Are there any stem cells that can regenerate the brain?

1091
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,000
we are very clear that

1092
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,500
after myocardial infarction

1093
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,000
It's the same with people

1094
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
after myocardial infarction

1095
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
you are going to mend

1096
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,260
repair your heart muscle

1097
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,300
You will be in the blood circulation from the bone marrow

1098
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,820
There will be a lot of stem cells will come out

1099
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,540
Run to the heart to grow new blood vessels

1100
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,960
turn into new cells to repair

1101
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,300
we already know this

1102
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,800
But these bone marrow or blood circulation cells

1103
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,900
Can it become new cardiomyocytes?

1104
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,660
everyone speaks differently

1105
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,000
so we engage our gene transfer agency

1106
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,660
And let's bully the mice again

1107
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,160
Seal two mice together

1108
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
so that his blood can be exchanged

1109
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
so we can study his genes

1110
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,200
so our first

1111
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,900
It is also the first time to prove that

1112
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,600
In fact, the blood circulation

1113
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,700
There is still a population of stem cells after myocardial infarction

1114
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,000
Not only does he go to the heart to help with repairs

1115
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,460
He will even turn directly into cardiomyocytes

1116
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,000
This is an important contribution of our study

1117
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,160
good

1118
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,600
Another study is

1119
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,000
is there any other way

1120
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,300
In addition to drug stimulation

1121
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,660
If I grow more blood vessels

1122
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,100
Would it also help endogenous myocardial regeneration

1123
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,140
When all your fields are barren

1124
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,340
it's hard for you to grow

1125
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
grow crops

1126
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,840
But if you open several channels

1127
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,680
can irrigate

1128
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,000
after water can go in

1129
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,640
you may grow new crops

1130
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Xinzang is also like this

1131
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,840
So in another study

1132
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,600
This is my other one

1133
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,440
this is my first PhD student

1134
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,000
Later, he also stayed in the laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow.

1135
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,840
Now working as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard

1136
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,200
Previous year at MIT

1137
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,400
In the next year at Harvard like this

1138
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,400
It is the first student in my lab

1139
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,000
everyone jokes

1140
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Usually there is a

1141
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,000
The first student call is always the best

1142
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
it's that kind

1143
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
Anyway, everyone can't get the award

1144
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
the whole world for example

1145
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,000
young student scientist

1146
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,600
There are 10 bonuses that can be obtained

1147
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,600
The only one in Asia is him

1148
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,800
Has won this award three times

1149
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,800
very good student

1150
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,400
One of the studies is

1151
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,200
we found that

1152
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,000
If we use another rice-resistant glue

1153
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,400
combined with a growth factor

1154
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,400
When more blood vessels can grow

1155
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,800
Whether it is in Dashu or in pigs

1156
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,660
We can all grow more blood vessels

1157
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,760
and arterial blood vessels

1158
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,000
Not capillaries, but arterial blood vessels

1159
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,360
arteries like this

1160
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,360
can even help inside our rotorrat

1161
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,760
to prove that it can grow new cardiac tissue

1162
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,960
These new cardiac tissues

1163
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
It was born from the relationship report

1164
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,400
I finished the first part

1165
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,860
In the second part, I will go further to introduce this

1166
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:26,260
How do we do tissue engineered myocardial regeneration

1167
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,460
This is actually my postdoc boss.

1168
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,020
One that Yu Qiuli and the others sorted out before

1169
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,620
for heart cell therapy

1170
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,260
What difficulties and problems will you encounter?

1171
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,320
You need to report treatment

1172
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,520
Of course you have to have a relationship report first

1173
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,760
Where did this relationship report come from?

1174
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,360
Is it to be derived from the relationship between embryos in the early stage?

1175
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,320
Still have to extract it from the body

1176
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,660
which one is better

1177
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,860
this is a big problem

1178
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,620
The second question is

1179
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,960
Okay, I already have a relationship report today.

1180
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,220
become cardiomyocytes

1181
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,120
Then how do I report this relationship?

1182
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,280
sent to the heart

1183
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,960
where i am going to be treated

1184
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,080
If you remember, I said at the beginning

1185
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,400
Although the heart will become so big in the end

1186
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,240
to have a heart transplant

1187
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,280
But when he first

1188
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,200
It's just a local problem

1189
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,160
Not the whole heart has to regenerate

1190
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,400
So when you're doing cell therapy

1191
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,640
how do you get these cells

1192
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,080
sent to where you want to regenerate

1193
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,920
Very important

1194
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,400
Today if we want to rely on the head

1195
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,600
But all your medicine ran out

1196
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,840
or you have to lean on your feet

1197
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
your medicine ran out

1198
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:24,880
of course it's useless

1199
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,680
This is actually a very important

1200
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,960
a concept

1201
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,400
you may also

1202
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,280
sometimes want to say

1203
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,320
Why did the doctor tell me to take food today?

1204
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,240
Called me to call yesterday

1205
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,520
even told me to suck

1206
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,320
stick to the skin

1207
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,200
Various

1208
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,880
way to enter the body

1209
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,440
In fact, he is not the same

1210
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,640
the same reason

1211
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,840
If we want stem cells

1212
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,720
put it in the heart

1213
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,200
you have to think

1214
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,600
How can I get stem cells

1215
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,280
can stay

1216
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,560
Can be injected where I am going for treatment

1217
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:55,800
do not forget

1218
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,960
the heart keeps contracting

1219
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,240
So you hit stem cells into your heart today

1220
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,040
no matter through point of view

1221
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
or hit the muscles directly

1222
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,500
24 hours later

1223
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,500
Only 1% of the cells remain in the heart

1224
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
others ran away

1225
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,500
Even if the 1% of the cells left in the heart

1226
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
in 24 hours

1227
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,000
Anyway, all 99 are dead

1228
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Only 1% are still alive

1229
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,500
say it again

1230
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Liver cells go to the heart

1231
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
After a day only 1% is left

1232
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,000
This 1% after another day

1233
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,500
Only 1% are still alive

1234
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,500
How much does 1% say that 1% is a student

1235
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,500
1/10,000

1236
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
another day

1237
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Gone

1238
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,500
So after 10,000 cells hit the heart

1239
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,000
Save one in two days

1240
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Another day may not be gone

1241
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
This is why we have many clinical trials

1242
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Cell Therapy in the Heart

1243
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
In fact, there is no way to produce good results

1244
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So how can more cells

1245
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
It's important to keep in the heart

1246
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and keep it alive

1247
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
not only survived

1248
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
it turns into cardiomyocytes

1249
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
with other cardiomyocytes

1250
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
we become good friends

1251
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
can shrink and jump together

1252
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,500
not it

1253
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,500
ok i stay

1254
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,000
I change my mind

1255
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,080
heart cells i will say

1256
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,040
But I don't care about others

1257
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:02,960
i dance my own

1258
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,680
that's bad

1259
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,480
what is that called

1260
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,480
mental disorder

1261
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,080
worse

1262
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,520
really miserable

1263
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,000
don't do it

1264
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,720
you did

1265
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,240
After taking stem cells, he was already a patient

1266
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,720
As a result, the patient caused him to go to the phone

1267
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,440
going to CPR

1268
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,440
something will go wrong

1269
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,600
So this is called

1270
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:18,720
electricity

1271
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,360
Integration of electrical conduction and details

1272
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,600
why is it called

1273
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,720
Electro-mechanical integration

1274
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,000
Integration of electricity and details

1275
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,520
because our cells

1276
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,960
Between heart cells and cells

1277
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,960
by ionic conduction

1278
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,160
electricity like this

1279
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,600
boo past

1280
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,160
Cells know one by one

1281
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,280
time to work

1282
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,040
It's time to shrink

1283
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,960
just shrink together

1284
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,800
ions turn over

1285
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,000
he has the swelling

1286
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,960
So it needs to rely on the conduction of electricity

1287
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,360
the heart must contract

1288
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,240
machine force

1289
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,520
So this is the integration of the machine world

1290
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,400
So this is called

1291
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,040
Integration of electrical and machine world

1292
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,240
叫Electro-mechanical integration

1293
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,400
So the stem cells we injected

1294
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,800
It needs to be able to become a heart cell

1295
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,840
but also with other

1296
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,200
The original cells of the heart integrate together and dance together with hands

1297
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,300
otherwise there will be big problems

1298
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,600
Then this cell therapy only in the heart

1299
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,900
will face the problem

1300
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,200
Cell therapy of organs from other tissues

1301
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,700
will not cause this problem

1302
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,200
Then if someone is nervous here, someone will tell me arque

1303
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,100
Hey, nerves also conduct electricity.

1304
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,700
Then why didn't the nerves take up this problem?

1305
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,600
then i'll joke

1306
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,900
If your nerve cell therapy

1307
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,600
not doing well it goes wrong

1308
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,100
At best you ask the patient to raise his right hand

1309
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,900
It kicks your left foot with you, it won't die

1310
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,900
Yes, but if something goes wrong with the cell therapy for the heart

1311
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,200
obviously something goes wrong

1312
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,300
would be a big problem

1313
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,700
So this is still different

1314
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,900
In the end, of course, we are doing clinical cell therapy

1315
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,100
is to consider its safety and stability

1316
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,300
this is very important

1317
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,300
Let's first talk about how the cells

1318
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,600
Get to where you are going for treatment

1319
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,300
Then we use a

1320
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,500
Water glue called Eco-resistant rice fiber

1321
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,100
This water gel is from when we were at MIT

1322
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,900
Developed in partnership with MIT

1323
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,400
it's basically a unit of protein

1324
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,700
specially synthesized

1325
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,800
special sequence of amino acid synthesis

1326
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,000
This water can be brought

1327
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,300
We inject directly into the site of myocardial ischemia and hypoxia

1328
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,740
we can put special drugs

1329
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,040
special cells

1330
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,140
Follow this water to directly hit the damaged heart muscle

1331
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,540
This is the result of some of our previous research

1332
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,540
with some patents

1333
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,200
what you saw earlier

1334
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,500
You may not know these

1335
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,540
what does this mean

1336
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,040
This is the name of each journal

1337
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,540
These are all good journals like this

1338
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,140
But those are small animals

1339
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,500
we are doing animal experiments

1340
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,940
We don't just bully mice

1341
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,440
In fact, we have to bully different animals

1342
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,640
Because different animals have different characteristics

1343
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,200
can represent different diseases

1344
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,640
Usually we start with small animals

1345
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,640
We will make the small animals bigger if they have results.

1346
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,340
Make it bigger and finally be a human

1347
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
in our laboratory

1348
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,900
In the field of our heart

1349
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,340
Usually we use four animals

1350
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Little mouse called Mouse

1351
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
A rat named Red

1352
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
A rabbit named Rabbit

1353
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and mini pigs

1354
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Meat pigs are one to two hundred kilograms

1355
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,000

1356
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
so we say mini pigs

1357
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
A mouse is about 25 grams

1358
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Rat 250g

1359
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Rabbit 2500g

1360
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Mini Pig 25000g

1361
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
come to schoolboy or schoolgirl

1362
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
did you see anything

1363
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You're so smart, Shi Jingwei

1364
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So if this represents the size of a mini pig

1365
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
this is a rabbit

1366
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
this is a rat

1367
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
what is this

1368
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Friends sitting in the back maybe you can't see clearly

1369
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
What is this

1370
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So it's not the same from childhood to adulthood

1371
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
because it's hard to say

1372
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
i'm a little mouse

1373
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
good result

1374
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'm going to do a human test tomorrow

1375
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
probably won't work

1376
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
not just like that

1377
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
If we were in different animals

1378
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
we'll make it the same

1379
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Surgical ligation Blood vessels tied up

1380
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
human myocardial infarction

1381
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,200
It also produces a different phenomenon

1382
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,600
For example, in terms of small animals

1383
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,400
where it produces a myocardial infarction

1384
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,160
Most of them are on the outside of the left heart pose

1385
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,560
if it's a pig

1386
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,960
You do the same ligation

1387
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,520
where it produces a myocardial infarction

1388
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,320
In fact, it is in two mental forms

1389
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,600
and the place ahead

1390
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,000
This is exactly the same as a human

1391
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,120
So you probably can't do this

1392
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,000
going to be a man

1393
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,000
you have to do this

1394
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,560
not just like that

1395
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,800
If the same pattern of myocardial infarction

1396
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,160
In small animals only one

1397
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,720
It only takes one week in the small family

1398
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,320
it changes

1399
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,880
Mind coins become so thin

1400
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,960
It will take two weeks

1401
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,680
Pigs are two months old

1402
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,840
like people

1403
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,280
So this is actually

1404
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,520
really tell you

1405
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,760
different animal patterns

1406
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,200
In fact, there are different characteristics

1407
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,880
different needs

1408
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,440
Then we use very smart

1409
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,560
The National Treasure Pig is called the Blue Feather Miniature Pig

1410
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,920
It has been pre-planted in Taiwan

1411
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,920
more than 100 years

1412
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,360
From the time of the Japanese

1413
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,960
has been preserved

1414
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,040
The Blue Feather Mini Pig

1415
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,440
Mini pigs, as the name suggests, of course happened in Orchid Island

1416
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,760
Produced in Orchid Island

1417
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,040
But if you go to Lanyu today and you can't find Lanyu pigs

1418
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:08,920
please don't blame me

1419
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,440
Because Lanyu no longer exists

1420
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,840
Lanyu mini pigs in stock

1421
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,640
because it doesn't grow big

1422
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,280
So it can only reach forty or fifty kilograms

1423
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,720
so you feed it

1424
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,280
going to be a pig

1425
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,080
It's useless to raise like this

1426
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,240
it just doesn't grow up

1427
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,440
So now Lanyu is

1428
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,840
The pigs in Lanyu are all mixed

1429
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,880
all big ones

1430
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,560
you can't find this kind of pig

1431
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,920
So luckily the Council of Agriculture kept it

1432
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,640
We use these Lanyu mini pigs

1433
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,040
From March 2009 to the end of last year

1434
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,720
We are like this in Xinji Gengshe

1435
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,560
Take the mini pig for our animal model

1436
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,280
We made a total of 297 pigs

1437
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,080
The meeting is like saying that I am not in Tainan now

1438
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,840
I'm in Taiwan

1439
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,640
We use different control groups

1440
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,080
Either Xinji Terrier Society or treatment

1441
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,000
its death

1442
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,320
The whole surgical factor is still very dangerous

1443
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,760
Its overall mortality rate is about 4.4%.

1444
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,920
Probably the best result in the world

1445
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,960
Then our first study is to simulate

1446
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,920
How to use the pig model to do clinical

1447
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,960
How do we do cell therapy

1448
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,360
The first study we did was to grind the pig down

1449
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,880
Come on, whether it's a pig or a monkey I used to make

1450
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,080
Or treat us all like human beings

1451
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:22,920
Has its own house suite

1452
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,680
It has its own operating room

1453
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,960
It has its own anesthesiologist doing it

1454
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,280
They are treated exactly the same as people

1455
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,000
Then after we grind down the pig

1456
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,680
we take its marrow

1457
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,240
Take ten CC of bone marrow

1458
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,960
enough cells

1459
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,840
Why? Because we take this bone marrow out

1460
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,960
We extract its monocytosphere cells

1461
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,960
Then mix with our rice fiber water glue

1462
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,360
Then hit the damaged heart muscle

1463
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,280
These cells do not escape

1464
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,120
If you only play cells

1465
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,960
Hit it in and it's gone

1466
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,280
So in America, abroad, even in Taiwan

1467
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,600
If you only make cells for clinical trials

1468
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,280
How much bone marrow do you draw from the patient

1469
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,240
so you know what?

1470
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,160
To 1200CC is easy to say

1471
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,460
But patients turn on you like this

1472
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,700
because you scored

1473
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,900
get a lot of cells

1474
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,160
Most of them don't see it

1475
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,960
just stay there a little bit

1476
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,660
to see a little effect

1477
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,260
We only need to pump 10CC

1478
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,760
Because our cells don't run away

1479
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,460
Wherever you type it is there

1480
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,160
So it will be better

1481
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,800
We found that the practice

1482
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,760
One month after the rent is completed

1483
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,460
We I just said two months

1484
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,960
only one month here

1485
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,060
please don't blame me

1486
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,760
Because we're doing rental Starlet for the first time and say

1487
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,860
We don't have much experience ourselves

1488
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,220
so we don't know we have to wait two months

1489
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,960
we'll just do it for a month

1490
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,120
but luckily

1491
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,660
It will be good in a month

1492
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,020
We make Zhu Ye the Xingdao tube

1493
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,560
to see how his heart works

1494
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
just found out

1495
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,660
If we only have to use the water glue of this rice

1496
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,560
after going in

1497
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,860
Although Zhu's contractile function is not better

1498
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,560
But the flexibility of the chapters is better

1499
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,320
Because his pen won't get thinner

1500
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,660
If we only play cells

1501
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,960
His contraction function will help a little

1502
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,920
But it doesn't help the chapter function

1503
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,080
because he can protect

1504
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Protect the myocardium and reduce his necrosis a little

1505
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
But things will still get thinner

1506
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
When we combine this hydrogel with bone marrow cells

1507
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
when playing together

1508
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I can make his heart at the same time

1509
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Both porosity and porosity function have become better

1510
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
why?

1511
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
because if we take this cell

1512
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Use the software of Red Silver Light to go

1513
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
to feed it

1514
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
those cells will glow

1515
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Then these cells follow our hydrogel

1516
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
after hitting the heart

1517
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
a month later

1518
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
we can still see him

1519
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Many are still in the heart

1520
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So because the cells don't run away

1521
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So it will work better

1522
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Then we learned

1523
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
one month is not enough

1524
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
so we just do it longer

1525
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
do it for three months

1526
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It turned out that after three months

1527
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
If only cell

1528
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
One month he helped the systolic function

1529
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
gone in two months

1530
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
if water glue

1531
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
His heart's systolic function isn't helping

1532
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
But loose function can last

1533
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
three months no problem

1534
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Do two Ken love each other?

1535
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Combining the two gives

1536
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
long time three months

1537
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
to three months later

1538
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Both can have a greater effect on the function of the heart

1539
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:00,500
Protect

1540
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,000
why

1541
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,300
Because our water degrades very slowly

1542
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,000
You know we often use some

1543
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Absorbable sutures to heal the wound

1544
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
you don't have to guess the line

1545
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
It each a different absorbable thread

1546
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Its degradation rate is different

1547
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
If it's faster, you want it to degrade as soon as possible

1548
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
It takes a long time and you hope it doesn't degrade too early

1549
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Our materials will take 3 to 4 months

1550
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,500
3 to 4 months after entering

1551
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,500
It will be completely degraded by the plant heart

1552
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,500
So as it degrades

1553
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,500
it will attract

1554
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
It turns out that the cells in the own strain

1555
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
run to where we hit

1556
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,500
generate more positive

1557
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,500
more blood vessels

1558
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
So mind coins don't get so thin

1559
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,500
This is what we use

1560
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,500
HPLC flutter analyzer to quantify the results

1561
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,500
the next question is

1562
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,500
what we did before

1563
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,500
To be honest, I really don't have much experience.

1564
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Although they all publish good articles like this

1565
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,500
But what we don't know much about

1566
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,900
What we did before was pigs tying up the big blood vessels

1567
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,160
Myocardial infarction is involved, get treatment quickly

1568
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,360
But will it be like this clinically?

1569
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,660
Is there a time when a patient with myocardial infarction runs ahead of you?

1570
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,560
Just say hurry up and call me, it's impossible

1571
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,760
So what we want to know is to say

1572
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,860
Such treatment if after myocardial infarction

1573
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,160
Do treatment right away or wait a day or wait four days

1574
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,560
even wait seven days to do it

1575
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,160
Will it also work

1576
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,600
It's all very simple

1577
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,360
It's all one sentence, but it takes a long time to do

1578
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,360
cost a lot of money

1579
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,960
This is Zhang Mingyao and one of us

1580
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,820
Ph.D.

1581
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,320
He's at a muscle growth company in the south now

1582
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,020
treat it like a baby

1583
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,320
he did many things

1584
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,660
he found out

1585
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:45,120
If our treatment after myocardial infarction in pigs

1586
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,320
do it right away or one day or four days

1587
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,720
It will make the pig's heart function better

1588
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,220
but if you do it in seven days

1589
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,480
sorry it's too late no help

1590
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,820
why is it like this

1591
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,080
because of myocardial infarction

1592
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
But after that he had a big damage to his heart

1593
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,500
But in the follow-up, his injury continued

1594
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
After waiting for a long time, his heart function is getting worse

1595
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
so you wait until seven days to do it

1596
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,500
His heart function has become worse

1597
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And this systemic vocal response

1598
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
will make your bone marrow cells worse and worse

1599
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,500
The ability to grow blood vessels is also reduced

1600
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,500
So even if you use it for healing effect

1601
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,500
not so good

1602
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
so the sooner the better

1603
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Well, then my dream comes again

1604
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
If one day we can be in Taiwan

1605
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
There is a treatment center like this one

1606
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I always think that we in Taiwan should have

1607
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
To develop more sophisticated

1608
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
relatively new technology

1609
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
With our good medical system

1610
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Instead of introducing foreign countries every time

1611
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
imported from abroad

1612
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
We should have something we develop ourselves

1613
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Our treatments are

1614
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,500
If after myocardial infarction

1615
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,500
Do it in four days and you will have better results

1616
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So if one day we really are

1617
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Taiwan can CREATE such a

1618
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
when the treatment center

1619
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
As long as the myocardial infarction is within four days

1620
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
can fly to

1621
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,800
Come to Taiwan to receive this treatment

1622
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,600
we can give you a better prognosis

1623
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,200
It's better to walk out alive

1624
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,500
In those four days, I could fly many laps in the Ninth Classic

1625
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I hope one day this dream can come true

1626
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,100
that another interesting stardis

1627
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:17,300
Do we have to use nanofiber hydrogel?

1628
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,800
can we use other

1629
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,200
This is another Ph.D.

1630
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,500
Now postdoctoral fellow Chen Jianxi Dr. Chen

1631
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,300
He takes hyaluronic acid

1632
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,600
this is playing every day

1633
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,400
There are two kinds of hyaluronic acid in our clinic

1634
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,600
one is knuckle

1635
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,600
This is degradable

1636
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,000
so it won't be long

1637
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,400
it will be degraded slowly

1638
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,700
One is to hit this

1639
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,300
Do you know what you are doing?

1640
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,800
This is a glue face

1641
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,300
so it can stay longer

1642
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,300
We use knuckles

1643
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,600
because we don't want it to stay for too long

1644
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,200
So if we take hyaluronic acid

1645
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,900
with bone marrow cells

1646
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,700
Do the same for the treatment of myocardial infarction in pigs

1647
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,100
Treating it will also work

1648
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,700
Because hyaluronic acid is originally

1649
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,100
Can help long-term students

1650
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,400
OK

1651
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,260
again

1652
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Do I have to use paleo cells?

1653
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,900
some patients are afraid

1654
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,560
Whoever hears that they want to vomit ancient times will have weak feet

1655
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,320
Although only Shi Xixi

1656
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,420
We found out that we might be able to take peripheral blood

1657
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,100
Or take several generations of blood

1658
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,260
Everyone knows we are in Taiwan

1659
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,720
We now have 100,000 tubes of several generations of blood

1660
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,420
stored in our cell bank

1661
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,660
We found that in the pig mode

1662
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,260
We take generations of human blood

1663
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,300
This is a collaboration with Dr. Huang Xiaoyuan, Princess Stone

1664
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,300
Take the blood of several generations

1665
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,420
Mixed with Ornithium and hitting the pig's heart

1666
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,760
the cell will be repelled say

1667
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,560
We want to give anti-rejection waist

1668
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,520
I'm like an organ

1669
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,720
We found that the practice

1670
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,800
May also help the function of the heart

1671
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,220
So it's not just nano water

1672
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,500
Ornithotic acid can also

1673
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,500
Paleo-cells

1674
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,760
We can also take generations of blood cells

1675
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,060
can achieve good results

1676
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,460
as long as the two are combined

1677
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,920
If you only hit cells, it's useless

1678
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,880
It's useless to just fetch water

1679
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,600
must be combined

1680
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,960
The issue of ischemia was just mentioned

1681
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,600
parotid encephalopathy stroke

1682
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,920
Cheeky Heart Myocardial Infarction

1683
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,200
There will also be big problems with the cheeks and feet

1684
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,400
This is actually such a patient

1685
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,600
More patients than myocardial infarction

1686
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,560
diabetic patient

1687
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,000
His blood vessels will be diseased

1688
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,400
will block in the end

1689
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,800
especially the lower limbs

1690
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,120
So you may have heard

1691
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,960
Many patients with diabetes

1692
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,160
his wound won't heal

1693
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,320
black toes

1694
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,640
so in the end it will

1695
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,640
amputated toes one by one

1696
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,440
In the end the whole foot will be cut off

1697
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,120
I have several such patients myself.

1698
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,240
This is actually a serious problem

1699
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,920
Because more and more people with diabetes

1700
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,360
no medicine

1701
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,840
sorry

1702
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,760
Because of this vascular patient

1703
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,240
It looks like it was eaten whole in the end.

1704
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,120
So we can't do bypass surgery

1705
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,520
We can't place the price

1706
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:52,520
only take medicine

1707
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,680
Make your blood less likely to clot

1708
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,800
accidentally bleeding

1709
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:57,960
These patients are actually very poor

1710
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,280
In the end there is no other way

1711
01:02:59,280 --> 01:02:59,960
just want it

1712
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,700
in this way

1713
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:05,600
When it comes to sick patients the main thing is to leave in the end

1714
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,200
Myocardial infarction or stroke

1715
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,600
But as long as he lives long enough

1716
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,100
he will be like this

1717
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,300
So is there any way we can get through

1718
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,000
The way we treat

1719
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,900
Similar treatment modalities for myocardial infarction

1720
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,200
can help these patients

1721
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,000
Let him not be like this one day

1722
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,700
This is actually a very important

1723
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,600
This is actually the first clinical trial we're going to do

1724
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,800
We started talking with the Ministry of Health and Welfare three years ago

1725
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,600
Department of Health

1726
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,200
FDA

1727
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,300
Apply for a clinical trial

1728
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,500
Then start because when you applied

1729
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,000
Although we have published a bunch of articles

1730
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,900
not bad article

1731
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,500
but they're still scared

1732
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,500
because never done

1733
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,300
No one in the world has done it

1734
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:47,900
So I explained that we have a lot of homework to do

1735
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,300
Let's just do the same thing obediently

1736
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,700
It's been three years now

1737
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,400
we haven't been fully approved to say

1738
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,500
can do this clinical trial

1739
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:58,600
But this year should be the last time

1740
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,800
should do this year

1741
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,600
Because it's really the last step

1742
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,120
We want our hyaluronic acid and water cells

1743
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,320
Or the treatment of hyaluronic acid combined with blood dripping cells

1744
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,400
can start to help our patients

1745
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,960
Can keep it from being amputated one day like this

1746
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,200
this

1747
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,920
The idea is actually very simple, just like before

1748
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,240
Hyaluronic acid itself will help grow blood vessels

1749
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,400
After the cells of this water enter

1750
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,600
won't run away right away

1751
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,800
So combining these two treatments

1752
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,320
May be able to grow better blood vessels

1753
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,600
to help patients with these peripheral vascular components

1754
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,920
We did this more than two years ago

1755
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,840
Have already applied to the NRPD program

1756
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,480
I have been stopping there waiting for the Ministry of Health and Welfare to say OK

1757
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,920
We will

1758
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,560
In National Taiwan University Hospital and City University Hospital

1759
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,920
Start our first issue

1760
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,680
Phase II clinical trial

1761
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,800
hope

1762
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,240
this

1763
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,320
Can do it this year

1764
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,360
let us

1765
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,000
could help these patients earlier

1766
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,080
because even today every day

1767
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,720
There are 19,000 patients in Taiwan

1768
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,480
at risk of amputation

1769
01:04:58,480 --> 01:04:59,920
so we just have to do it earlier

1770
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,300
maybe save a few legs

1771
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,800
One leg represents a family

1772
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,800
not a leg

1773
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,700
The last thing I want to introduce to you is

1774
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,400
Wear a study of stem cells

1775
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,300
ok we go here now

1776
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,300
We can now wear stem cells

1777
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,300
Or a type of cells called IPS cells

1778
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,900
induced pluripotent stem cells

1779
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,800
That is, the Japanese mountain raw rice

1780
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,240
called what he did get

1781
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,400
This study of the Bill Award

1782
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,400
So it is not a problem to become a New Territories cell

1783
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,700
But now we want to deal with this matter

1784
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,000
good

1785
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,000
Take cells to the New Territories to help these patients

1786
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,300
The results of more than ten years of clinical trials

1787
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:44,200
Today there are more than 10,000 patients worldwide

1788
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,800
have received cell therapy

1789
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,500
Mostly own bone marrow cells

1790
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,600
or peripheral blood cells

1791
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,500
to treat his heart disease

1792
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:52,800
Of course mainly abroad

1793
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,200
America Most Europe

1794
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:55,800
over the past ten years

1795
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,200
Those 10,000 patients are registered

1796
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,900
the unregistered one

1797
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,300
We didn't know it was registered

1798
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,420
More than 10,000 patients have received this

1799
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,700
autologous cell therapy

1800
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,660
After more than ten years of such clinical experimental research

1801
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:09,860
come to two conclusions

1802
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:14,060
First cell therapy to treat heart disease is safe

1803
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,260
You don't have to worry about its side effects

1804
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:19,900
The second conclusion is cell therapy to treat heart disease

1805
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,060
is invalid

1806
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,020
or only slightly

1807
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,460
or only a short-term effect

1808
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,600
The main reason is what I just said

1809
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,660
Called in and disappeared

1810
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,820
But there's still something to do

1811
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,980
A lot of things just develop slowly

1812
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,660
Then one of them is France

1813
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:35,780
Feliz Mahlerchet

1814
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:36,940
a friend

1815
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,820
The clinical trials they did ten years ago

1816
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:41,180
made nine patients

1817
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,500
Take his skeletal muscle cells

1818
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,980
stem cells from his skeletal muscle

1819
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,860
differentiate it into muscle cells

1820
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,780
into his own heart

1821
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,780
Because skeletal muscle cells are very good

1822
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,860
Our heart muscle regenerates poorly

1823
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,260
i just said

1824
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,060
But our skeletal muscle regeneration ability is very good

1825
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
If you work hard to perform today

1826
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Hit hard and I may die a lot of cells

1827
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But I also stimulated a lot of skeletal muscle stem cells

1828
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
to regenerate my skeletal muscles

1829
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So these muscles are very good at regenerative

1830
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And it has a great advantage that

1831
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It is not afraid of hypoxia and ischemia

1832
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
If we compare skeletal muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells today

1833
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
grow together in a hypoxic environment

1834
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
In less than a day, these cardiomyocytes are probably dead.

1835
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Skeletal muscle cells are still alive

1836
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Can live for more than a week no problem

1837
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
is autologous

1838
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
muscles everywhere

1839
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
so you'd want to say

1840
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
how nice

1841
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
There is no better source of cells than this

1842
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Why are you doing stem cells with him?

1843
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But from early clinical events it was found that

1844
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
These nine patients took their own skeletal muscle myocytes

1845
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
after hitting the heart

1846
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
There are five bars to install the electric shock device

1847
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
because it creates dysphoria

1848
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
that's what i just said

1849
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
The two cells cannot combine

1850
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Shrink and jump together

1851
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Because its electrical conduction mechanism is different

1852
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
even if it's your own

1853
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So the electrical conduction to the skeletal muscle

1854
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
When it reaches the myocardium, it hits the wall.

1855
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,600
It won't pass, so there will be arrhythmia

1856
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,160
So obviously this won't work

1857
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,460
Another relatively new study

1858
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,800
This is Xinyatu's collaborator

1859
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,360
It's my big brother named Chuck Murray

1860
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,660
He is wearing stem cells in the United States

1861
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,460
Become the most famous group of mental cells

1862
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,020
They published an article over a year ago

1863
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,560
It is to take people's wearing stem cells

1864
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,620
differentiate it into cardiomyocytes

1865
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:29,700
Then beat it into the monkey's heart

1866
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,660
they first discovered that

1867
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,500
can be inside the heart of the long class

1868
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,600
To grow human brain tissue

1869
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,700
this is a big big breakthrough

1870
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:43,500
But they also found that arrhythmia

1871
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,500
Why is the heart rate irregular?

1872
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,300
The same thing, human brain cells are the same as monkey brain cells

1873
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,900
Of course they won't shrink and dance together.

1874
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,500
so how to decide this question

1875
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,500
is an important question to decide

1876
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,660
OK, let me introduce our two technologies quickly.

1877
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,340
That is, we use the technology of electric imitation silk and magnetic field nano

1878
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,200
That is to say, we go to spray electricity to imitate silk

1879
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,960
spray it and it will run around

1880
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,640
But we use magnetic fields to structure

1881
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,240
The position of controlling the running of electric imitation silk is adjusted one by one

1882
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,440
is permuted

1883
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,640
like this

1884
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,760
Then the control group and the experiment have a control group

1885
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,840
The control group is to spray it out and let it run by itself

1886
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,920
So it produces this kind of running around

1887
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,360
such a random

1888
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,840
The nanofiber

1889
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,040
Then we make it a patch for the new machine

1890
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:34,640
So one is permutation and combination and the other is not.

1891
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,280
Then we found that when we put the new machine cells

1892
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,360
In the two new tents with vascular endothelial cells

1893
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,240
most important cell

1894
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,920
A patch like this that is aligned in this arrangement

1895
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,440
it will grow out one by one

1896
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,760
Just like the mobile organization of our new account

1897
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,080
If you put it on the back of the random row

1898
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,560
its own random run around

1899
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,720
Then we use a relatively new one called an atomic force microscope

1900
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,000
very nanometer very thin

1901
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,440
to detect its contraction

1902
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,560
you can find out that

1903
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,040
If you compare cardiomyocytes with endothelial cells

1904
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,400
well aligned in this

1905
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,040
When the surface of the myocardial patch

1906
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,640
it will shrink better

1907
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,400
Jump faster and more regularly

1908
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,040
Then we put this myocardial patch into

1909
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,600
Most of the MI-colored outside go

1910
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,240
You have to line up, you can't line up some guides

1911
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,800
Can't line up vertically

1912
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:26,560
We need to compare that fiber with the fiber of our heart

1913
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,840
The angle must be right and not crooked.

1914
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,160
Put it on after it's done

1915
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,720
Two months later, I will go for an ultrasound of the heart

1916
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,760
will find out that

1917
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,440
This is better

1918
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,600
Such myocardial patch

1919
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,000
It will greatly help the function of the heart

1920
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:42,760
do cardiac catheterization

1921
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,120
We can also do cardiac catheterization in mice

1922
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,960
The same is true for the systolic function of the heart

1923
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,760
It will be better with the sparse expansion function

1924
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,560
It will even reduce the area of ​​myocardial necrosis

1925
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,320
and two months later

1926
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,160
This is the cardiac patch we implanted

1927
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,720
upper cardiomyocytes

1928
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,040
it will follow

1929
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
The structure of the scheming of the normal heart is

1930
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,500
direction is exactly the same

1931
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,000
So when we take this heart out

1932
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Give it a software that covers ions

1933
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,500
and then look at the way it conducts electricity

1934
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:16,000
will find that such

1935
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Scheming cells in permutations

1936
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,500
send it up

1937
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,000
Such a scheming patch

1938
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,500
will allow our electrical conduction

1939
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,000
From this scheming patch

1940
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,500
It can be transmitted to a normal heart

1941
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
MOOS passed smoothly

1942
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,500
If you put it in that messy long

1943
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:33,500
the fiber

1944
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
it produces a heartbeat

1945
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:39,500
This is also an easy study

1946
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
the other one

1947
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
embryonic stem cells

1948
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,500
islet pluripotent stem cells

1949
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,500
can become heart cells

1950
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
Can be used for many purposes

1951
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,500
Can do cell therapy

1952
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,500
can do drug development

1953
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Can be used to explore the mechanism of disease

1954
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,500
But from embryonic stem cells

1955
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,500
or IPS stem cells

1956
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,700
cardiomyocytes

1957
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,700
It's also the cell of the embryonic heart

1958
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,000
not like our normal mature cardiomyocytes

1959
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,700
So the two are still different

1960
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,000
Although in theory

1961
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,700
You know it's very difficult for us to get cardiomyocytes

1962
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,300
It may be difficult for you to tell patients

1963
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,900
sorry i want to study you

1964
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:18,300
why do you have this disease

1965
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,800
Cut a piece of your heart and let me do some research, okay?

1966
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,700
Let me cut a piece of your head out

1967
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:25,600
Why don't you just cut it into pieces?

1968
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,500
patients probably won't accept

1969
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,700
But today if I tell you

1970
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,400
we have a technology

1971
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,200
I just want to draw two CCs of blood with you

1972
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,600
I can grow your embryonic stem cells

1973
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,600
I can differentiate it into cardiomyocytes

1974
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,700
differentiate into nerve cells

1975
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,200
differentiate into liver cells

1976
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,500
to do research

1977
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,500
do you want to

1978
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,500
Probably most people will nod and touch to see

1979
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,700
cut a piece of heart you don't want

1980
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,200
If you draw two CCs of blood, you will probably accept it.

1981
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:55,000
This is the purpose of our technology

1982
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,100
I will continue to say this

1983
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,300
mouse embryonic stem cells

1984
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:00,300
we made a

1985
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:00,960
gene transfer

1986
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,500
The benefits of embryonic stem cells are

1987
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,500
it differentiates into the body

1988
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,500
more than two hundred cells

1989
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,400
Including what we usually dare not be cut

1990
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,300
cells of the brain

1991
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,700
Heart muscle cells Liver cells

1992
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,300
We can all use embryonic stem cells

1993
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,600
Or IPSL differentiates it

1994
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:14,900
Okay, so we did a genetic change.

1995
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:16,300
Let this embryonic stem cell angle

1996
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:17,300
it becomes cardiomyocytes

1997
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:18,900
it will glow green

1998
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:21,300
So we can use a machine

1999
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,400
cell separator

2000
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,900
purify these cells

2001
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,700
then we found these

2002
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,100
green cardiomyocytes

2003
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,300
it is immature

2004
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,300
But if it compares with vascular endothelial cells

2005
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:33,100
grow together grow together

2006
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,800
it'll start on day one

2007
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:35,800
start after day three

2008
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,400
Line up one by one

2009
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,600
like our base fresh tail

2010
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,600
And it has a better base fresh tail structure

2011
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,700
then you just ask

2012
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,600
what endothelial cells do

2013
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,500
original endothelial cells

2014
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,200
it can be released

2015
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:51,800
it can help this

2016
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,200
produce some tiny tiny

2017
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,200
RNA

2018
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,400
called microRNA

2019
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,300
So when we put

2020
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,300
Find these four important

2021
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
The MICRO-RNA we want is called 125B199A21222

2022
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Treat these four MICRO-RNAs as drugs

2023
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
to add to this immature scheming cell

2024
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
it becomes more mature

2025
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
And these four MICRO-RNA

2026
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Their mechanism of action has a specific...

2027
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
our MICRO-RNA this tiny nuclear soup nucleic acid

2028
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
It usually has hundreds of mechanisms of action

2029
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
There are 10,000 to 20,000 voices

2030
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
But every MICRO-RNA

2031
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It has a different mechanism of action

2032
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
It's funny that the four of us

2033
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
it actually has the same goal

2034
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
the same mechanism of action

2035
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
This gene is called ERB4

2036
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
This gene was found in early Tibet

2037
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
A gene important in embryonic development

2038
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
But once you mature and become an adult

2039
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
The gene is gone

2040
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
it doesn't express

2041
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
We found that our MICRO-RNA

2042
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
is acting on this gene

2043
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So when we directly in this scheming cell

2044
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
When this gene suppresses it

2045
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,560
It will grow more mature myocardial tissue

2046
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,400
not just in mice

2047
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,200
It's the same in humans

2048
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,960
human embryonic stem cells

2049
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,120
become cardiomyocytes

2050
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,160
It also started as an embryonic entity

2051
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,080
But after the four of us

2052
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,160
After treatment with micro-RNA drugs

2053
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,400
It also grows more mature cardiomyocytes

2054
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:22,920
its electrical conduction

2055
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:24,560
The amplitude of the image jump

2056
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,000
like mature cardiomyocytes

2057
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,840
So this is one of our models

2058
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,320
This is our newest

2059
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:34,000
A newly graduated doctoral student named Keith

2060
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,000
Because this study is in the Sale Report

2061
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,200
is his cover story

2062
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,000
So if you notice the news

2063
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,360
It seems to be noisy

2064
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,160
It's so loud

2065
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:46,680
But everyone seems to be very interested in it

2066
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,760
so everyone asks

2067
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,720
where is your student

2068
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,240
we are going to visit him

2069
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,400
Our model is through

2070
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,480
immature embryonic stem cells

2071
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,680
derived cardiomyocytes

2072
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,040
cultured with endothelial cells

2073
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,000
It will stimulate these four chronic

2074
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,760
It will always be ERBV4 this gene

2075
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,960
Let immature scheming become mature scheming

2076
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,280
and interestingly

2077
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,600
Such a heart cell

2078
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:11,200
We only need one treatment after giving this drug

2079
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,360
to 60 days later

2080
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,320
This accumulation of tissue between each cell

2081
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,040
This is to prevent mental disorder

2082
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,040
it can grow very well

2083
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,520
So these cells can be used for great purposes

2084
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,160
so as it may generate

2085
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,160
Such a large potential application

2086
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,920
With the support of NRPV

2087
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,640
Just now the vice president mentioned

2088
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,720
We are different units from Taiwan for stem cells

2089
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,720
some good friends some seniors

2090
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,440
join together

2091
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,040
we have a goal

2092
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,240
I just hope to help stem cells in Taiwan

2093
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,040
do something

2094
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:46,520
what to do

2095
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,680
we set up a core facility

2096
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:51,440
Then come to help clinical doctors in Taiwan

2097
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,880
Want to do this Yushima sex more adult

2098
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,200
Stem Cell IPSL

2099
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,360
to help them do

2100
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,120
because it takes a lot of time

2101
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,960
a lot of energy

2102
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,300
It's not easy to do and it even costs a lot of money

2103
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,900
We hope that such a coalition can be produced

2104
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,860
Help Taiwan do this

2105
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,820
iPS stem cells

2106
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:13,100
The goal is to have it by the end of next year

2107
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:14,660
We're going to make 100

2108
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:19,460
Stem cells made from patients with 100 diseases

2109
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,200
and store it in

2110
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,760
The Food Industry Institute invites people from all over Taiwan to do research

2111
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,460
can apply for

2112
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,160
it will make a big difference

2113
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,520
Because these iPS

2114
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,080
Well-intentioned and fruitful stem cells

2115
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:33,320
like i just said

2116
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,920
I don't need to take yours and cut your heart

2117
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,120
no need to cut your head off

2118
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,420
No need to cut your liver

2119
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,020
I just need to draw two cc of blood

2120
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,480
I can turn it into your own stem cells

2121
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,760
and differentiate it into these cells

2122
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,360
for disease research

2123
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,860
for drug screening

2124
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:50,960
for personalized medicine

2125
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,220
so one day

2126
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,280
Now it's slowly starting to happen

2127
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,620
This technology will develop to

2128
01:17:56,620 --> 01:17:58,980
if there is a patient

2129
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
he has cancer

2130
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
he has to do chemo

2131
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
But we know that many chemotherapy drugs

2132
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
he will be cardiotoxic

2133
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Many clinical patients

2134
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
After chemotherapy for his cancer

2135
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Cancer shrinks or even disappears

2136
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But the patient passed away with heart failure.

2137
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
this is a serious problem

2138
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
If we have these technologies

2139
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Applications to Personalized Medicine

2140
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
patient today

2141
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
we know you have cancer

2142
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
One day you may have to do chemotherapy drugs

2143
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
let me borrow it from you first

2144
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Take two CG blood first

2145
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
give us two months

2146
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
even shorter time

2147
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
i can make your

2148
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
IPS stem cells

2149
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
we can make your cardiomyocytes

2150
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
your liver cells

2151
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
your nerve cells

2152
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Then let's test it for you

2153
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
What drugs are available in hospitals now?

2154
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Which of these medicines is best for you

2155
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
The least toxic and the best

2156
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
so we can talk to you

2157
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I'm sorry, you can't take this medicine.

2158
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
But it's best for you with this medicine

2159
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,600
If we say we are in Taiwan

2160
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,440
Especially through Taiwan BioBank

2161
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,500
Taiwan Biobank

2162
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,500
this one in Taiwan

2163
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,660
Now we're doing this

2164
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,040
200,000 patients draw blood

2165
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,300
Then do research every 5 years

2166
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,700
inside this database

2167
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,880
We can choose the most

2168
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,340
most representative genotype

2169
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,460
then each of us

2170
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,260
make it all IPSL

2171
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,500
save it all

2172
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:29,100
These 50 people can represent

2173
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,560
More than 70% of the people in Taiwan

2174
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,760
His genotype will be very similar

2175
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,100
So one day if we were to use him as a representative

2176
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:38,760
even take him

2177
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,360
Differentiate it into cells for cell therapy

2178
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,060
as long as people in Taiwan

2179
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,560
you have a 70% chance

2180
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,220
can be found inside these 50 stem cells

2181
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,560
with you can use

2182
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,720
Can be used as a cell chair

2183
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,900
like an organ chair

2184
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,560
This will have a big impact

2185
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,720
even say that we can put this

2186
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:57,720
Although only 50

2187
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,020
But it can represent 70% of

2188
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,700
Taiwanese genotyped cells

2189
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,400
turn it into cardiomyocytes

2190
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,900
turn it into nerve cells

2191
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,300
turn it into liver cells

2192
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,700
I just said one day we'll have a

2193
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,000
Taiwanese special heart chip

2194
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,200
Taiwanese special liver chips

2195
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,800
Taiwanese special neural chip

2196
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,400
We can do drug screening

2197
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,200
We can come and check for disease

2198
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,500
Personalized medicine, of course

2199
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,400
That's what we're talking about

2200
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:26,800
future clinical trials

2201
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,100
No need to actually capture 100 patients

2202
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,700
Give him this medicine and try to see if there is any response

2203
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:34,000
We just have to test it on this wafer

2204
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,000
It is possible to obtain the most preliminary results

2205
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,700
So this is called what we are talking about now

2206
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,000
clinical trials on a chip

2207
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
or a clinical trial in a test tube

2208
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,200
就Cinco Trial on a chip

2209
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,700
or Cincotrile in a tube

2210
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,300
that's what we're going to do

2211
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,800
this this this

2212
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,400
The reason for the project

2213
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,700
Then we took the traditional one, of course.

2214
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,500
This way of life in Shandong

2215
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,300
Then we use the technology of Sentai virus

2216
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,400
IPS cells can be achieved by drawing blood

2217
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
And in Taiwan we have six hospitals, partner hospitals

2218
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,200
North, middle, south and east

2219
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:09,700
It is National Taiwan University Hospital Taipei Veterans General Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

2220
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,700
City University Hospital, Gao Medical University Hospital and Tzu Chi Hospital

2221
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,800
These are the patients we collect

2222
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,700
There are also sources of clinician collaboration

2223
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,200
Our Biomedical Institute at the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

2224
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,800
At National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, National Health and Rescue Hospital

2225
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,300
and construction

2226
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,000
can do this kind of service

2227
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Generate these IPS cells

2228
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,700
After it's done, it will be sent to the biomedical center of the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine.

2229
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:34,400
Let's do an analysis with the construction company

2230
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,200
confirm this is good

2231
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,000
is available and can be stored

2232
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,300
It is open to everyone to apply for and use

2233
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:44,000
Then it will be placed in the construction site for everyone to apply

2234
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,800
This is our whole consoling guy

2235
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,800
The main manpower and the main manpower of our biomedical institute

2236
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,700
such a study

2237
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:53,100
two months ago

2238
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:54,700
Originally made an appointment with Xingai Amalaka

2239
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:55,900
Sanzhong uncooked rice

2240
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,800
This is Mr. Toyota

2241
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,200
He used to be from Taiwan, he can

2242
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,500
Zhongcai who beat Wuting Pharmaceutical Factory

2243
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,000
Later, after retiring, I returned to Japan for more than half

2244
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
has he been in taiwan long

2245
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Long-distance relationship with Taiwan

2246
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
one of his favorite things to do

2247
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
It's like helping Taiwan to develop relations with Japan

2248
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,500
so through his relationship

2249
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,000
I had an appointment to go with

2250
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Meeting of Kunia Malaka

2251
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,500
How to talk about this sea swan

2252
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,000
because he does it

2253
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,500
Grandpa who did this

2254
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,000
so i don't want to talk about the winner

2255
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,500
promised

2256
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
But the day before, I was suddenly called to Tokyo

2257
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,000
prime minister

2258
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
What does the Prime Minister of Japan want from him?

2259
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,500
So then they had Deputy Director

2260
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
come out with us and talk like this

2261
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:31,500
They also want to be with us

2262
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,500
Do it together with us

2263
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,500
this is what he said

2264
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,500
I don't know if I'm talking

2265
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:37,500
He said that the genetics of the Japanese are very similar to those of the Taiwanese

2266
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,500
i don't know his

2267
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,500
where did he come from like this

2268
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,500
But this kind of cooperation is always good

2269
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,500
I always feel that

2270
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:48,500
Taiwan happens to be in the center of the Asia Pacific

2271
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,500
Taiwan also has the best in the world

2272
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:55,500
at least one of the health care

2273
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,500
such a system

2274
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,500
so we have very good

2275
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,500
basic research person

2276
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,240
have good clinicians

2277
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,760
So if we can build it into a

2278
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,160
Asia-Pacific One Biomedicine

2279
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,480
biotechnology industry

2280
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:08,840
such a central word

2281
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,160
i think we have a good chance

2282
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,560
This will also be helpful for us

2283
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,400
This is also my cooperation with the dean and vice dean

2284
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,040
There are also seniors who are working in many courtyards

2285
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,760
Hope to be in the National Biotechnology Research Area

2286
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,000
We can be able to do Taiwan's more cutting-edge

2287
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,800
advanced such a creature

2288
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,160
A development of the biotechnology industry

2289
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,520
In the end, of course we all have to thank us

2290
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,120
cooperation partner

2291
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,080
At the Bank of China Hospital, at City University, National Taiwan University Hospital

2292
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,400
Construction Office, Ma Street, National Health Bureau Institute

2293
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,320
And our cooperation abroad

2294
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,000
HARBORS、STANFORD、UC San Diego、UCSF

2295
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,680
This is the former academician

2296
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,200
and this group in Karliski Sweden

2297
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,160
and Xiatu

2298
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,000
In addition our funding is

2299
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,520
Except for government agencies

2300
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,720
We have some US pharmaceutical companies in the biotech industry

2301
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:56,280
Bawasli European Army, Asbalanika, Takoda

2302
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,800
And Taiwan's Malidi Army and Rebus Army

2303
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600
Foreign pharmaceutical companies and Taiwanese design companies

2304
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,760
Support and cooperation

2305
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,000
that's our team

2306
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,760
Current team at the firm

2307
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,960
Finally I'll just take a minute

2308
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,160
This is my doctor's teacher

2309
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,400
Dr. A.S. Eli Cruz

2310
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,480
he passed away last year

2311
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,040
he is one of mine

2312
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,440
A role model for my life

2313
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:23,920
i just mentioned

2314
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,400
he is in the hub

2315
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,480
Completed by Harper School of Medicine

2316
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,760
After getting his medical degree

2317
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:32,480
research training

2318
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,040
thirty years in seattle

2319
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,200
build the entire surgical

2320
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,560
The system of this study looks like this

2321
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,440
he's always been great to me

2322
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,200
I've always said he's the best teacher in the world

2323
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:42,720
the best person

2324
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,000
Anyway, among the tens of thousands of people in Huada

2325
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,760
If

2326
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,040
If everyone says only one person is good

2327
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:48,680
everyone else is bad

2328
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:49,760
that good man is him

2329
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:50,800
that's the kind of person

2330
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:54,360
so

2331
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,560
He has always encouraged me positively

2332
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,800
So I don't have this teacher's encouragement

2333
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,160
I can go on. I have a very important one this time.

2334
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:05,160
But now he passed away last year like this

2335
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,660
that's sad too

2336
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:10,160
Mr. Li Xudong, former deputy director of our firm

2337
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,160
He also passed away last week

2338
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:15,160
Then he was the person who influenced me the most when I returned to Taiwan

2339
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:18,960
because this can't go on

2340
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:19,960
I can't go on, I can't go on

2341
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:25,660
anyway he has always given us a very positive kind of power like this

2342
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,660
Because when I was growing up

2343
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,160
peace in the business

2344
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,820
Come here two days a week

2345
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:34,120
So the incident is here for over six years

2346
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,620
And the time he is not in the event room is actually him

2347
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:39,520
Because he still comes every day after retirement

2348
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,620
The student, he discussed with the student

2349
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:46,520
Taking care of the students, teachers, mothers, and the owners all provide delicious food for the students

2350
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:49,820
That's why the students all looked for him instead of me.

2351
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:52,120
Because you find me, you say this to me

2352
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,060
So then I said, teacher, please be a bit more white.

2353
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:56,060
I'm half black and you want to be half black

2354
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:58,560
Otherwise, students won't be serious about this

2355
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,560
He wrote very good calligraphy

2356
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
he passed away last week like this

2357
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I think

2358
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I'll stop here

2359
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
that has a little time

2360
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
still some time

2361
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We can all come and continue the discussion like this

2362
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Excuse me

2363
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Lali Lala talked a lot

2364
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Hope it helps

2365
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Let's work hard together

2366
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Thanks

2367
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Thank you for the wonderful speech after the social

2368
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
yes see these people

2369
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
go one by one

2370
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
It's also very sad

2371
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Xu Dong and I are also very popular

2372
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
i didn't know he passed away

2373
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
But why do you write the number 24 here?

2374
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
The 24th is today

2375
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
today is the 23rd

2376
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Today is the world wrong

2377
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,000
it was last saturday

2378
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
last saturday

2379
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
OK

2380
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
14

2381
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
good

2382
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I think there should be many

2383
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I want to ask our teacher thank you

2384
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Come

2385
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2386
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
That

2387
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
What I'm slightly curious about is that

2388
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Great efforts have been made in

2389
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
To allow cells to associate with therapeutic substances

2390
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Where

2391
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,840
Then I have heard that there seems to be some methods, such as

2392
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,400
where to stick it like a thing

2393
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,600
Didn't notice you didn't use this method

2394
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:11,520
I even saw that at the back of your speech you said

2395
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,340
Make a scheming patch that works

2396
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:16,640
I don't know if I have thought about it

2397
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,220
That is to say, between the scheming patch and the necrotic scheming

2398
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:23,300
Maybe put that several different

2399
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:26,120
You can take this material to regenerate it

2400
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,420
Is it possible to do the same

2401
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,260
Or why you don't do it thank you

2402
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:37,120
Because you want the cells of your scheming patch to be the same as the original scheming

2403
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,460
The cells of the heart can integrate together

2404
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:42,260
So it's best to just

2405
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:43,260
close together

2406
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,080
If there is a thing between you

2407
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,880
it might not work

2408
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,160
lock together jump together

2409
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,480
the answer is as simple as that

2410
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,780
Thanks

2411
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,160
Or about one in every thousand people in advanced countries will die suddenly

2412
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:10,000
You also mentioned the research in this area of ​​Xinji Kesi many times

2413
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,240
I don't know if the best

2414
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,720
It's the teacher, you have solved all the problems of Xinji Kesi

2415
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,600
Then the rate of one in a thousand sudden deaths

2416
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,600
How much do you think can be solved

2417
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:24,560
ok thanks this is an important question

2418
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:31,360
We have a plan with Dr. Chen Shi'an from Taipei Veterans General

2419
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,160
Because Dr. Chen Shi'an works as a psychological minister all over the world.

2420
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,760
I think being the leader is very important for a group

2421
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,760
Then all we have to do is say

2422
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:44,960
For those patients who already know he already has a psych minister

2423
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,760
but don't know why

2424
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:51,760
Similarly, we can't take all these patients to cut their hearts and cut them into pieces for examination.

2425
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,760
So we hope to draw blood from these patients

2426
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,360
Turn it into IPS cells and turn it into psycho cells

2427
01:28:59,360 --> 01:28:59,960
come and see him

2428
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
What's wrong with these new cells

2429
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
The advantage of this is that

2430
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
if you want to cut a sick heart

2431
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
At most, the patient will ask you to cut a small piece for research.

2432
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
A small piece with few cells

2433
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
only do it once

2434
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
at most once

2435
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I will never let you do it the second time

2436
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
But if we put his two thin blood

2437
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Turn into IPS into new cells

2438
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
In theory we can get infinite

2439
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
New Cells with Unlimited Craftsmanship

2440
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
can do a lot of research

2441
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
with drug screening

2442
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
This is also another

2443
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
The Approach to Personalized Medicine

2444
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
In other words, why the patient has been

2445
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Anticardiac drugs have been doing poorly

2446
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Sometimes it's even hard to control

2447
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
what is the reason

2448
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
You can't always take his heart

2449
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
make slices for inspection

2450
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Even do the electrophysiology of the heart like this

2451
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Those are actually pretty dangerous

2452
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But we can put his

2453
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Blood-drawn IPS turns into new cells

2454
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
We can do drug screening

2455
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Mechanism of making drugs

2456
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Finally you can talk to him

2457
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It turned out to be like this

2458
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
This drug is actually the best choice for you

2459
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
instead of asking the patient to

2460
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
what are we

2461
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,000
be a white mouse

2462
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,840
In fact, many patients sometimes act as guinea pigs

2463
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,120
The doctor is also working as a guinea pig

2464
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,960
But the doctor loves the patient more and is the weaker side

2465
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,760
So if we use these techniques

2466
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,760
Let the patient know earlier

2467
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,000
In fact, what kind of drug choice is best for you

2468
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,200
This will be of great help to patients

2469
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:23,040
Emergy comes

2470
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,600
ask the teacher

2471
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,160
The experiment you just talked about

2472
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:29,680
I need people and money

2473
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,240
but spend so much time

2474
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,600
Is it faster if you give more money and more people

2475
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,160
Turned ten years into one month

2476
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,680
will have such an effect

2477
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:41,600
If you have a big team

2478
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,520
and many

2479
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,840
Is this progress so fast?

2480
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,680
And you have made a lot of achievements

2481
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,000
I guess the question is a bit complicated

2482
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,080
we can't say

2483
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,080
Everyone don't do it, I just do it

2484
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,280
Because there are quite a lot of complicated factors

2485
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,080
but i am

2486
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,460
I don't know what the vice-president or the secretary-general think

2487
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:04,500
because i have a friend

2488
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,460
He is the leader of the Singapore relationship package like this

2489
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,920
He is actually involved in many government policies

2490
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,460
Policy formulation and budget allocation

2491
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:13,800
I envy him

2492
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,620
Because every year he meets me, he tells me

2493
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:17,460
How much more has our tech budget grown

2494
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:21,460
That's the latest I was last time

2495
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:25,260
The meeting organized by NOVATIS at the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

2496
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:27,620
He'll tell me about his tech budget

2497
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:29,620
I calculated that we were probably

2498
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,420
Are we about 100 billion a year?

2499
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:32,420
almost

2500
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,420
their annual tech budget

2501
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:37,620
Now it has grown to about 300 billion Taiwan dollars a year

2502
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,420
ever less than us

2503
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:43,120
The population of Singapore is only slightly more than a quarter of ours

2504
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:46,620
So they're just over a quarter of our population

2505
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:49,120
His tech budget is three times ours a year

2506
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,620
So it turns into saying

2507
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:53,820
What is the average technology budget for each person?

2508
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,120
12 times

2509
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,620
i remember i want to go abroad

2510
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,620
1990 when going out

2511
01:31:58,620 --> 01:31:59,620
I was already an old student

2512
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,240
What scared me that year was

2513
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:06,600
In 1999, Singapore decided to invest in the biotechnology industry

2514
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,560
So they started to spend 30 billion Taiwan dollars a year, and then they spent it like this

2515
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,860
Later, it has been growing until now it is 300 billion

2516
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:20,160
So I have to be honest and say that our research on dry bags is actually a lot behind Singapore.

2517
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:25,800
They can occupy a group overnight in the world and we can't

2518
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,120
so i think we might have to try harder

2519
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,480
Of course, if the government is in financial difficulties, everyone knows that under the circumstances of financial difficulties

2520
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:38,960
We may not be able to do everything, we have to pick some priorities to do

2521
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:44,160
Maybe it's just like what the director of the upgrader district said, what we have to do

2522
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:47,240
Can't do everything but we have to do it best

2523
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:54,400
Recently, with the representatives of the Netherlands in Taiwan, they are hoping to establish cooperation

2524
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,720
Even encouraged us to go to the Netherlands to cooperate with us like this

2525
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:59,920
They say that even the technology of the world like the Netherlands

2526
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Here in the powerhouse of biotechnology

2527
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,400
They also only choose a few fields to work hard to do this

2528
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,800
will be competitive

2529
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,800
I don't know if this will help us

2530
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:13,400
If we say that this is a

2531
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:15,200
We are worth investing in, worth doing

2532
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,400
In fact, there are some fields in Taiwan that are quite competitive.

2533
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,000
is quite competitive

2534
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,800
It will help if we do this

2535
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:26,600
It’s like we established the console of the IPA club

2536
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,400
In fact, it was proposed more than three years ago.

2537
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,000
but many people disagree

2538
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Reasons for disagreement will feel like saying

2539
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,800
Before doing stem cells in Taiwan, there were really few

2540
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,800
It will be troublesome to talk about this

2541
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,600
If we use some of the resources to do this

2542
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,600
then the others will decrease

2543
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,200
but then again

2544
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,800
If we feel that this is the right thing to do

2545
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:46,600
we will do it

2546
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,800
It's not about taking Nobio. It's already taken.

2547
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
It is not for the cooperation of Nature Science

2548
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,600
neither

2549
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,200
It's actually for our own national health

2550
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,000
For our research projects

2551
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,200
For our basic strength

2552
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,200
So even if you don't want to take Nature Science

2553
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,400
I don't want to talk about it even if you don't want to post NATURE Science

2554
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,700
You still have to do it and try to do it well

2555
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,800
So we actually have the same scale

2556
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,500
The money we use is less than one tenth of that of foreign countries

2557
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,600
But I think it's time to do it

2558
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,000
So last year was our first project of the whole year

2559
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Our laboratory has posted 3 million such

2560
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,000
Mourn this to the vice president

2561
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,300
I hope this year will not be like this, we will lose another 3 million like this

2562
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,400
do it when it's time to do it

2563
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:26,600
i always feel like saying

2564
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,600
Everyone sitting here thank you so much

2565
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,800
every dime

2566
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,700
it's all taxpayer money

2567
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,900
including my own tax money

2568
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,400
we can't run away for a dime

2569
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,100
So it's really the responsibility to do it well

2570
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:41,300
Can't be wasted

2571
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,400
If I'm a student again, listen up

2572
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,500
I've said it many times

2573
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,700
Our scientific research money is the taxpayer's money

2574
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,100
we can also waste

2575
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:54,700
I want to ask that teacher

2576
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:58,400
You said two CCs of blood were drawn for the IPS

2577
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,400
Is it specific to your patients or in general

2578
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,120
People with average IQ can

2579
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,720
It will be all right

2580
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:02,220
are all

2581
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:04,240
how to express

2582
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,080
if i say yes

2583
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:07,120
then go

2584
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,800
Even if you are not a patient

2585
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,960
Can IQ people do it too?

2586
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,320
I have to apologize to you for this

2587
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,600
because it takes a long time

2588
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,320
spend a lot of money

2589
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:19,760
if you are abroad

2590
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,320
you say

2591
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:21,760
i wish to know

2592
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,720
I'm going to make my own IPSELS

2593
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,280
you need to spend at least thirty thousand dollars

2594
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,120
to be able to make your appearance

2595
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:31,240
That is to say, I am willing to shed two nights of blood

2596
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,520
I have to pay

2597
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:33,720
That is to say, if you want to make

2598
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,520
Your own cells that you can use in the future

2599
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,160
right

2600
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,560
It's like this in foreign countries

2601
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,040
what we do now

2602
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,520
We really have to be selective

2603
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,080
with object

2604
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,160
have a specific object

2605
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:44,680
yes

2606
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:45,320
yes

2607
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,160
So if say

2608
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:46,880
you already know

2609
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,600
when your own genotype

2610
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,560
then we can discuss

2611
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,040
Thanks

2612
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,240
then you might be

2613
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:54,040
one of our rare

2614
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,200
then we'll do it for you for free

2615
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,840
But you have to Promise

2616
01:35:58,160 --> 01:35:59,480
same idea

2617
01:35:59,480 --> 01:35:59,880
that is

2618
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,600
We donate with all of these

2619
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,600
including patients

2620
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,000
Including the doctor, we help him do it for free

2621
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,400
it's government money

2622
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,000
He wants to promise one thing

2623
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
after making it

2624
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,400
You need to be able to expose technology

2625
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:13,400
for everyone to use

2626
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:16,000
Of course this patient donor profile

2627
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
we can't make it public

2628
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
This IRB has that

2629
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
That must be protected by the Personal Data Law

2630
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
but you must agree to say

2631
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
we do a good job for you

2632
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
And guarantee the best quality

2633
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,600
but you have to donate

2634
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,600
available for everyone to use

2635
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,600
that makes sense

2636
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:33,600
i mean

2637
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,600
is your object enough

2638
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,600
we are still growing

2639
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:40,600
yes

2640
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:44,600
We will have a more familiar problem

2641
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:48,600
I've been doing this report for a while now.

2642
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:53,600
Because now everyone cares about the biotech industry

2643
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:54,600
Newspapers for the past two days

2644
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,600
you can also see

2645
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,600
Our euro has always been long

2646
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,600
on board

2647
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,560
this stem cell

2648
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:07,160
What are the uses that are actually in use now?

2649
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,720
Because you can also see that there are many companies

2650
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:12,540
As you said just now, the two details

2651
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,880
There are also people who use chicken blood to save it again, etc.

2652
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:19,200
A lot of business activities are going on

2653
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,240
these things

2654
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:23,800
Is it all useful or is it

2655
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,880
I'm not saying which stock I'm going to invest in

2656
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,700
But I really don't know

2657
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:31,240
these stem cells

2658
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:34,060
current

2659
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:37,880
Let me give you an example of what can be used in practice

2660
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,460
A few years ago because my teeth had to be treated

2661
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,240
this bone is not good

2662
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:43,520
they just

2663
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,640
I just installed this bone powder, wait a minute, I heard that there are also stem cells in it

2664
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:51,460
Then he promotes this

2665
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:53,260
skeletal

2666
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:56,320
the real body of my skeleton

2667
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,120
so that is

2668
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:59,920
looks feasible

2669
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,600
and already confident

2670
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,400
So stem cells are now in

2671
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,500
What are the things that are generally used

2672
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:12,700
Chairman, this is a big problem

2673
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,700
different stem cells

2674
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:22,500
Different stem cells have different uses

2675
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,200
So far

2676
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,200
was in Japan

2677
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:32,400
There are three licensed products that are ready for commercialization

2678
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,500
The first one is whether you want to guess

2679
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,700
what was the first stem cell product

2680
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:40,000
or products of regenerative medicine

2681
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Products for regenerative medicine including stem cell tissue engineering

2682
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
The first product is

2683
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:45,200
Probably the skin, the skin is the easiest

2684
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,200
So when we get mad, there are people in Japan who help

2685
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,800
So their first product was

2686
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,800
In the case of a burn patient

2687
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,400
he takes a small piece of skin

2688
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:56,700
Can give you the whole tablet within a week

2689
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,300
my skin looks like this

2690
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,600
The second product is cartilage

2691
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:06,080
So using arthroscopic very small wounds

2692
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:08,040
Take a small piece of cartilage and raise it a lot

2693
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:09,920
It's time to fix it

2694
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,760
a month's time

2695
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,960
to repair your own cells.

2696
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,280
third heart

2697
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,560
The heart is the same is to take that

2698
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,640
top stem cells

2699
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,040
Muses Kamas stem cells

2700
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,600
it's the same as laying it on

2701
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,000
A membrane called Ph sensitive

2702
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,960
This is their Japanese unique technology

2703
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,520
That is to say, the cells

2704
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,400
after planting on that membrane

2705
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,200
temperature change

2706
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,720
The film will roll up

2707
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:37,640
You don't need to knock it down

2708
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:39,800
it will survive better

2709
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:41,600
So this film can be attached to

2710
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,160
damaged surface of the myocardium

2711
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:45,400
It's the Sawar from Osaka University

2712
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,200
what they are doing

2713
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,080
it was them a month ago

2714
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,560
Just been approved

2715
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,800
Japan Postsei approved

2716
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:53,360
The third product looks like this

2717
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,080
right

2718
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:55,480
Didn't you use it when you pressed it?

2719
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:56,200
Um

2720
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,400
do you really have stem cells or fake

2721
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,400
actually stem cells

2722
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,840
a lot

2723
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:01,500
a lot of

2724
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:02,140
stick to stem cells a lot

2725
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:03,700
what you just said

2726
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,140
Insistence on stem cells does exist

2727
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:06,440
And because sticking to stem cells

2728
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,240
Its purpose is to grow bones

2729
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,100
long cartilage

2730
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:10,300
So it's actually make sense

2731
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:12,300
This is done in many places abroad

2732
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,600
just say a lot of stuff like this

2733
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,740
it

2734
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:16,340
to Japan

2735
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:17,380
Japan because of cell therapy

2736
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:19,300
Go to the forefront and the fastest

2737
01:40:19,300 --> 01:40:19,940
In Japan

2738
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:22,940
it's up to now really its epigenetic province

2739
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:24,500
Heke's company

2740
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,000
Cellular products that can be made

2741
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:26,940
just these three

2742
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:28,800
Everything else is done in the hospital

2743
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,100
it's easy in japan

2744
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:30,800
we just talked

2745
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:32,100
Our cell therapy application for three years

2746
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:33,240
still can't do it

2747
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,600
In Japan as long as it is

2748
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,960
Hospital IRB Consent

2749
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,100
it can directly do

2750
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,900
No need to go through your epigenetic province

2751
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,600
this cartilage to

2752
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,240
this joint this

2753
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:45,600
Nearly the whole doctor is not there

2754
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:46,840
Do something like this?

2755
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,140
That

2756
01:40:48,140 --> 01:40:49,600
Seems to be doing quite well

2757
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:50,740
doing clinical trials

2758
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,140
right

2759
01:40:51,140 --> 01:40:52,640
still doing clinical trials

2760
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,540
OK

2761
01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:57,700
I don't know if there are any other problems

2762
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:58,800
no matter the heart

2763
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,000
or stem cells

2764
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,380
very important now

2765
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:09,740
I'm sorry, I'll just ask one more question

2766
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:15,620
The teacher just mentioned stem cells and also mentioned that different countries have different degrees of loosening research

2767
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:21,760
Now in Taiwan, I seem to have heard that if you are not very familiar with it, you can’t use Petai stem cells.

2768
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:27,900
Then we need to untie this side so that researchers can dispute the use of

2769
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,980
Stem cells, do you think this is appropriate or something?

2770
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:35,060
Petai stem cells cannot be used in advanced countries

2771
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:36,600
human

2772
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:38,660
Except for very few clinical careers

2773
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:39,160
All

2774
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:41,460
No country has approved

2775
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,260
Petai Stem Cells Turned into a Product

2776
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,540
for cell therapy

2777
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:46,340
Currently there is no

2778
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,120
Because Petai Stem Cells

2779
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:49,660
to not quite

2780
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:51,200
Ethical considerations

2781
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:52,740
Because Petai Stem Cells

2782
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:54,260
he has great potential

2783
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,580
As I just said, he can become more than 200 kinds of physiological cells

2784
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:57,820
very capable

2785
01:41:58,320 --> 01:41:59,860
but you want only one of them

2786
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,600
You injected embryonic stem cells into the heart today

2787
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,800
Although it may grow cardiomyocytes

2788
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,200
but it will grow other

2789
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:09,200
in trouble

2790
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:11,800
So we know very little about embryonic stem cells

2791
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:13,800
So it's better to say

2792
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,000
We call embryonic stem cells or IPSEL

2793
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
turn it into various cells

2794
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,200
for drug screening, toxicology testing

2795
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,400
Discussion of genes, even personalized medicine

2796
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:24,400
this is no problem

2797
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,200
But if you want to turn these into a product

2798
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,600
it's more difficult

2799
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,600
But there are many companies

2800
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,400
What you are doing now is just like what the vice president said just now

2801
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:36,800
That is, they store cells

2802
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,200
After storage, it can be made into various treatments in the future

2803
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,600
For example, our

2804
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:43,400
this should be able to speak

2805
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,400
All papers have been published

2806
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:50,400
sorry i go back

2807
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,800
For example, that Selgen

2808
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,600
This is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the United States

2809
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,400
Their strategy is the same as some companies

2810
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,200
that is to say they are

2811
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,400
Fascinity in GMP

2812
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:05,500
under the laboratory that meets the specifications of that drug

2813
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:07,300
just make it tube by tube

2814
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,300
various stem cells

2815
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,400
Then take this tube of stem cells as

2816
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,400
Think of it like stem cells are also drugs

2817
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,700
So when it uses this stem cell as a drug

2818
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:22,600
Do clinical trials of clinical treatments for different diseases

2819
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,000
if it works

2820
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:26,800
In the future it will be approved by the US ADL

2821
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,000
it can sell the drug

2822
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,200
for example

2823
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,600
Of course, these are mainly diseases that cannot be treated at present.

2824
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,800
rare disease

2825
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:35,700
mainly

2826
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,700
then if it works

2827
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:40,400
Then it can sell you a tube of cells in the future

2828
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:41,400
as medicine

2829
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,300
So this pattern is more

2830
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,200
Most of them are like this now

2831
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:46,600
just say

2832
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,700
approved but still very limited

2833
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,500
Are there any other questions?

2834
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,800
Our heart beats several times in a lifetime

2835
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:57,500
almost

2836
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I don't know how to count

2837
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,860
But our new exhibit has about 10 billion new machine cells

2838
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:08,960
Did you have it just now please come please

2839
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,040
I want to ask the teacher

2840
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:18,680
That is to say, various cells differentiated from ESC and IPS

2841
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:20,740
There seems to be some differences

2842
01:44:20,740 --> 01:44:23,560
don't know say such a difference

2843
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:28,420
where is the difference

2844
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:31,320
Cells differentiated from true IPS

2845
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:34,060
It can really be used for clinical application

2846
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:35,860
ok thanks for your question

2847
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:37,940
That is, wearing stem cells

2848
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:41,060
Derived new machine cells or nerve cells

2849
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:43,160
Turn blood into IPS

2850
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,740
Derived new machine cells and nerve cells

2851
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:47,820
what's the difference

2852
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:49,140
cannot replace

2853
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:51,580
Everyone's results are different

2854
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:53,420
so there's no judging yet

2855
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,820
The simplest answer is this

2856
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:58,780
No matter what, back to the origin is still the same

2857
01:44:58,780 --> 01:44:59,820
That is to say

2858
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,400
the purpose of that part

2859
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:03,840
We hope to be personalized medicine

2860
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,300
You can imagine that we are doing about two hundred

2861
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:08,500
about two hundred

2862
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,700
We all look different

2863
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:13,700
so you can imagine

2864
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:15,300
Each of us has a different heart

2865
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,900
Each of us is genetically different

2866
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,000
so it's hard for you to say

2867
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,500
You use one cell to have an effect on everyone

2868
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,800
even if you are a

2869
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,600
have been clinically tested

2870
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,800
I have been taking the medicine for twenty years

2871
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,500
Everyone's reaction may still be different

2872
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,200
That creature is actually very complicated

2873
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:36,400
I studied a medical engineering myself

2874
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,200
Doctor of Medicine

2875
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,200
He also worked as a postdoctoral fellow at MIT for several years

2876
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,000
deep feeling

2877
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,900
In fact, there is a big difference between biology and engineering.

2878
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:47,900
Biology is far more complex than engineering

2879
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:49,600
for example

2880
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,400
For example, I used to be in Seattle

2881
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:52,400
Everyone knows Boeing

2882
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,000
He was flying in Seattle

2883
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:55,500
That Boeing 747

2884
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,100
He has 30,000 parts

2885
01:45:57,100 --> 01:46:00,000
We probably have about 30,000 genes in that person

2886
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
That's it

2887
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,500
Those 30,000 Boeing 747 parts

2888
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:05,000
if everything is complete

2889
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
experienced engineer

2890
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
There are engineers and blueprints

2891
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
spell it out

2892
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Come on, maybe you can drive and fly

2893
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,000
But 30,000 genes

2894
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Makes 30,000 proteins

2895
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
In the past, one gene and one protein

2896
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
but it's not that simple

2897
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Sometimes several genes and one protein

2898
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Sometimes one gene and several proteins

2899
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,000
leave it alone

2900
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Thirty thousand genes count as three eggs

2901
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Thirty thousand proteins

2902
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
as if we put

2903
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Thirty thousand people locked in one room

2904
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
someone is sleeping

2905
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
someone is eating

2906
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
someone is chatting

2907
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
someone is playing

2908
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Everyone reacts differently

2909
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
it produces these

2910
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
All combinations of pairings

2911
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Absolutely more than 30,000 parts

2912
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
lie there without moving

2913
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
in terms of complexity

2914
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
so this is a creature

2915
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
It's very different from an engineer

2916
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Even if we have put

2917
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Human Genome Project

2918
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Complete the decoding of human genes

2919
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
you have to study it

2920
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
don't say in a hundred years

2921
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
maybe in a thousand years

2922
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
we still only know

2923
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
very small portion

2924
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Of course what you do now must be much better

2925
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,000
you ask me now

2926
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,700
These cells derived from ESL

2927
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:03,900
How big is the difference

2928
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,500
I think this is still case by case

2929
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,900
It is more important to return to their respective

2930
01:47:11,200 --> 01:47:11,900
come please

2931
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:13,800
thank you teacher

2932
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,500
Just now you mentioned that there are new

2933
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,500
new long-term disease

2934
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,200
We are in prime time for four days

2935
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,100
can do a reminder

2936
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:25,100
a practical problem

2937
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:26,400
in four days

2938
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,200
I'm afraid it will be too late

2939
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:30,700
If you use autologous this

2940
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:31,700
cell words

2941
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:33,100
words of limb cells

2942
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,100
you have to go through

2943
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:36,700
calculation,calculation,calculation

2944
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:39,100
Then also check that it is in the

2945
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:41,100
The whole domination process has contamination

2946
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:42,500
this problem

2947
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:44,300
this is a consideration

2948
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:45,500
the second one is

2949
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,500
If we use Algenic

2950
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,800
These cells are like the Japanese JGC day meeting company

2951
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,700
They're also doing this cell-forming

2952
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:55,700
We use mass production

2953
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:56,900
or edic

2954
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
It should be a word back

2955
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
then stole it

2956
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
This is expected to learn from the material of cells

2957
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
or other different

2958
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
He's like this because he's also a drug dealer

2959
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I think these two considerations

2960
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I don't know what you think Mr. Xie

2961
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,000

2962
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I may not have explained clearly just now

2963
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Our technology is grounded from the patient

2964
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Whoever pulls the bone, kisses the water and pours it in

2965
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,000
The whole process takes about an hour and a half

2966
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
No need to culture cells, no need to move, no need

2967
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
So there's no need for those

2968
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
So there is no such problem in time

2969
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
But if there is Alogenic, it is the issue

2970
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
The issue is that people are the same

2971
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
but not other animals

2972
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
but different people

2973
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
if we can

2974
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
store all his cells

2975
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
He will be available in the future

2976
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
This is of course a better way

2977
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Actually that's all

2978
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Biotech companies owned by pharmaceutical companies

2979
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
cell therapy companies their approach

2980
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Only in this way can we sell

2981
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
However, one must also consider that

2982
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
the same

2983
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,760
Different Diseases Different Cells

2984
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,460
it has different pros and cons

2985
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:06,880
for example

2986
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,960
Of course, what it does more often is stick to stem cells

2987
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,760
Stick to stem cells no matter where they come from

2988
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,160
Stick to stem cells it has great benefits

2989
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,460
It can be cultivated in large quantities

2990
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:18,360
You can move it and use it one by one

2991
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:20,240
It is also very organized

2992
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,160
Adhere to stem cells, there are many studies that say

2993
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:28,160
an immune response that does not produce too severe

2994
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:30,120
so it sounds like everything is fine

2995
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:33,000
But insisting on stem cells has its limits

2996
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,620
Because sticking to stem cells it mainly grows into bone

2997
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:40,120
It is easier to grow into cartilage or fat cells

2998
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:42,520
to grow elsewhere

2999
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:44,760
That is to say, you need to rely on this to persist in stem cells

3000
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:45,920
become cardiomyocytes

3001
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:46,860
become nerve cells

3002
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:49,320
Or maybe it's harder to become a liver cell

3003
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:51,360
In fact, many people think that it is not

3004
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:53,820
I even said that I knew it very early in the animal room

3005
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:57,620
That is to say, you inject persistent stem cells into the heart

3006
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,420
Although it can secrete

3007
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Growth factors grow blood vessels

3008
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
But he also grows bones

3009
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Then you want to inject stem cells into the heart to treat myocardial infarction

3010
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Although he will grow blood vessels

3011
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
but he has bones

3012
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
You probably don't want to grow bones in your heart

3013
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
So actually every kind of

3014
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
indication is still different

3015
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
problem must be considered

3016
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But in terms of part-time stem cells

3017
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
He can be mass-bred out of the village

3018
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,000
he does have his great strengths

3019
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Although we say

3020
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Autologous does not need to consider the problem of immune rejection

3021
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And then pretty fast

3022
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
but we also have our problems

3023
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
For example very simple

3024
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Many patients are

3025
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
His bone marrow cells are not good

3026
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
It's just that his ability to grow blood vessels is not good.

3027
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
He will have a myocardial infarction

3028
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
what will happen

3029
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Then you do it with his cells

3030
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Although we have given a good way

3031
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I can't guarantee that he will have a good result.

3032
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
like we're doing animal experiments

3033
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Actually doing pig like this

3034
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
So these actually take some time

3035
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
to come and prove

3036
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
which one will be better

3037
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Better

3038
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,400
But I think biomedical

3039
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:04,960
Especially the progress of clinical medicine

3040
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:08,800
Sometimes it takes a long time to develop

3041
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,160
Now for these results

3042
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,960
Who will be the best in the future

3043
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:15,560
It may take a while to understand

3044
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,200
but you must do

3045
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,920
Otherwise these patients have no hope

3046
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:20,560
no chance

3047
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,440
And a patient with a heart attack

3048
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,680
I probably didn't mention it just now.

3049
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,920
Although most of us in Taiwan

3050
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,240
As long as it is a place above a medium-sized city

3051
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:31,160
patients with myocardial infarction

3052
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:32,080
Once sent to the emergency room

3053
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:36,000
Can open blood vessels in 90 minutes

3054
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:39,080
But don't forget to say

3055
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:41,280
Myocardial infarction has about one-third of the patients

3056
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,480
No chance of receiving these treatments at all

3057
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:46,160
it passes

3058
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:47,880
Even a patient is lucky

3059
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,480
He can in the fastest time

3060
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:51,040
Open up the blood vessels

3061
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,760
A day or two in an AC ward

3062
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:53,800
transfer to general ward

3063
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:56,160
then went home

3064
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,880
Nearly one in five such patients

3065
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,920
Go home after these best treatments

3066
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:04,520
Three months back or new failure

3067
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,960
Because he had a relatively large myocardial infarction

3068
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:11,200
The moment of his heart attack had already sealed his fate

3069
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:14,840
Some of these patients are quite young in their 30s and 40s.

3070
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:19,320
But for the rest of his life, he spent decades in new exhaustion

3071
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,560
There are actually a lot of patients

3072
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:23,600
so one-fifth, almost one-fifth

3073
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,360
The whole world is the same, so is Taiwan

3074
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,400
There is currently no treatment for these patients

3075
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,400
It's you, just give the strength agent, the cardiotonic agent

3076
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:35,280
Give the angiodysplasia agent this treatment

3077
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:36,840
Patients with these treatments help

3078
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:39,440
He's just delaying, just treating the symptoms.

3079
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,400
It doesn't really help his heart function much.

3080
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:44,760
So in the end he still has to go until the heart grows bigger

3081
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:45,600
to transplant this path

3082
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:48,320
What we hope is to be able to help such patients

3083
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:49,400
so these

3084
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:52,440
What is being done now is to develop these technologies and these treatments

3085
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,960
In fact, many large parts

3086
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:55,760
is here to help these

3087
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:59,120
I met the need to indication

3088
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:00,000
including what we just

3089
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Talk about the next ischemic patient

3090
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,860
ok one last question

3091
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:08,960
Ask Mr. Xie

3092
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,260
The Egyptian on the Chinese lion

3093
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:16,760
The Egyptians made Aunt Mulan to take out the glandular organs for extra processing

3094
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,560
There is no physiological meaning in it, except that they produce blood

3095
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,660
This other eye problem is

3096
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:26,460
Some people judge that brain shit is death

3097
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:29,660
Some people say that the permanent stop of the glands is death

3098
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:31,660
Are these two correlations related?

3099
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:33,860
The first question is easier for me to answer

3100
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:35,360
because i don't know sorry

3101
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,660
The second question we are judging

3102
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:40,460
stop now, let's go

3103
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:41,660
this is for sure

3104
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:45,260
But the brain shit we are talking about is actually different from the vegetative state

3105
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:51,060
Brain shit means that if you don’t actively give him these life support systems

3106
01:53:51,060 --> 01:53:52,660
he is going to pass

3107
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,560
Then our general vegetative people don’t need any respirator

3108
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,760
without any drugs or anything

3109
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,460
he can still lie there

3110
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:00,560
So actually the two are not the same

3111
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,380
We're doing tracheal transplants for brain-dead patients.

3112
01:54:03,380 --> 01:54:04,880
not pointing fingers

3113
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:10,000
is that clear? yes

3114
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Just now you...

3115
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
what is it

3116
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:18,000
The same factor makes the heart grow

3117
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
many reasons

3118
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
But the most common is myocardial infarction

3119
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Heart muscle grows for many reasons

3120
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
myocardial infarction

3121
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
slowly at most

3122
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
But there are many, many types of heart disease

3123
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
This talk can last a long time

3124
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
no myocardial infarction

3125
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
will, will

3126
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
such as cardiomyopathy

3127
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
It has congenital defects in its muscles

3128
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Its heart will grow bigger and bigger

3129
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
For example, after a long period of high blood pressure

3130
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
The heart can compensate at first

3131
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
If it doesn't work later, it will collapse like this

3132
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Even a viral infection can give you cardiomyopathy

3133
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:59,000
It's not just closing arterial tissue and causing myocardial infarction.

3134
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,500
Yes, so will demonic diseases

3135
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:04,160
But this is less

3136
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:08,240
not obsessive

3137
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,720
It's a problem with the demon

3138
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:10,880
give your heart a problem

3139
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,440
This is now less and less

3140
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:15,200
Because the most common access to this is the previous

3141
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,720
caused by rheumatic fever

3142
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:20,240
When public health is poor

3143
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,440
For example, when you are twenty or thirty years old

3144
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:24,400
Infectious rheumatic fever not well controlled

3145
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:26,440
Slowly the companion demon becomes destructive

3146
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,600
After ten or twenty years, I will change my partner

3147
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,440
This was very common in the past

3148
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:32,960
Thirty years ago we performed open heart surgery

3149
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,320
Seventy to eighty percent are changing companions

3150
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:37,520
Now less than one out of ten is changing companions

3151
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:40,640
It's all headhunting now

3152
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,360
not the same

3153
01:55:42,360 --> 01:55:42,880
exist

3154
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,920
that already has a companion

3155
01:55:44,920 --> 01:55:46,800
it will be like this

3156
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,600
Can't change eyes

3157
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,160
or already connected

3158
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,160
want to change connection

3159
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:54,000
it already has a companion

3160
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:54,760
Everyone has a companion

3161
01:55:54,760 --> 01:55:56,040
There is no way without a companion

3162
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,160
i keep saying that

3163
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
a lot of hair bits a lot a lot

3164
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
but already have these

3165
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
there is no ambulance

3166
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
If your normal life situation

3167
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
or give a diuretic

3168
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,000
so that you can maintain a normal life

3169
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
you can ignore him

3170
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
but you have to always

3171
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Follow up every three months

3172
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
If your heart function starts to get worse

3173
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
consider surgery

3174
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
That surgery usually we hope is

3175
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
If you can repair it, try to repair it and don't replace it.

3176
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Because the repair may only need two stitches.

3177
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
then if you change

3178
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,000
the next question is

3179
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Then you want to change the pig half mill?

3180
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
half ground pork heart

3181
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Your heart hair may need to be replaced with a metal half grinder

3182
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
it has pros and cons

3183
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
At this time, different factors should be considered

3184
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I'm basically saying

3185
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Don't move the knife if you can

3186
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
It's you who rely on medication

3187
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
There is no way to solve your problem

3188
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
you are still uncomfortable

3189
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
If you're talking about

3190
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
your own situation

3191
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Ninety percent of my judgment is yours

3192
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
no knife needed

3193
01:57:03,340 --> 01:57:04,600
Otherwise you wouldn't be like this

3194
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,400
can talk to me like this for so long

3195
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,280
You're half dehydrated and there's a new noise

3196
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:15,100
A new noise does not necessarily mean that there is a major problem

3197
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:17,400
Might need

3198
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,480
Make an appointment with Dr. Xie to visit National Taiwan University

3199
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:24,060
I have an outpatient clinic at National Taiwan University Sina Surgery on Wednesday.

3200
01:57:24,060 --> 01:57:26,360
I didn't have to see a hundred patients like the vice president said

3201
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:27,900
I suddenly won't have more than five patients

3202
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:29,940
So you come and I can chat with you no problem

3203
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:37,620
Periodic physical examination is still required

3204
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:42,740
well because of the time we have to be here

3205
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,020
just stop

3206
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,080
We thank Dr. Xie

3207
01:57:48,640 --> 01:57:52,740
Research continues to strengthen our future of this biomedical

3208
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,800
Whether it's treating diseases, etc.

3209
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:59,380
we have great expectations thank you doctor

3210
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Thank you for your viewing
