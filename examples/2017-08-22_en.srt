1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,800
train wig ride

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Academia Sinica's August knowledge test lecture begins

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We ask Vice President Liu Dong to host for us

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It is an honor and a pleasure to introduce the multi-institute Institute of Biomedical Sciences

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Also my colleague Tao Minghua researcher

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Dr. Tao graduated from the first-level department of National Taiwan University

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He went to study in America

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Bea University at the Top Individual

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Get a Ph.D. in Immunology and Microbiology

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then he went to another top university

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Postdoctoral Research at Stanford University in California

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
where the main research is related to the total flow

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
After that, he returned to Taiwan to enter the Academia Sinica

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
From assistant researcher to associate researcher to researcher very smoothly

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now a researcher at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
His research work has always been related to total flow

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,640
This year is gene therapy or immunotherapy

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,640
It's also his topic today

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,740
In this regard, he has made many contacts and contributions.

20
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,440
also published in good journals

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,340
He also received many awards

22
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,720
including hospital

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,120
Here are the many awards for young scholars

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
and the Ministry of Science and Technology

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Contact Research Award

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,260
Immunotherapy has been

27
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,460
Attention in Oncology World

28
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,660
Some breakthroughs in recent years

29
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,960
And it's a very exciting breakthrough

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,460
In fact I was about a year ago

31
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,160
I also give a talk on immuno-oncology

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,460
immune therapy

33
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,400
I recognize the title after

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,200
Immunotherapy sees light

35
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,400
But in fact it's not just sign light

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,240
It should be fairly obvious by now

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Very excited, Dr. Tao has his expertise in this area and the results of his research

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I believe he will give us a very incisive and wonderful speech today

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We welcome Dr. Tao with warm applause

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hello everyone Man An

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Today is more tense than in the international lecture hall

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because in Chinese, the task we received was to put all the slides in Chinese

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then the speeches all use Chinese nouns

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is a big challenge for our researchers at Academia Sinica

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So actually these slides for this talk took quite a while to make

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I hope to be able to use some relatively easy-to-understand scientific language

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
then communicate with everyone

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Currently this rather promising approach to cancer treatment

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then I will try to introduce to you today what is immunotherapy

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In fact, immunotherapy

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Or our simplest is this

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Does everyone in English understand this?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
using the body to fight cancer

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
with your own body

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to fight cancer

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In fact, against these tumors against cancer

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
These key weapons are needed

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
we all have

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
just because of different genetic background

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
some people his immune system

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Easier and more effective against cancer

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
some people are worse

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now in immunotherapy

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I just hope to use some foreign medicine

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Overcome stimulates the patient's immune system

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
to fight cancer

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is Cancer Immunotherapy

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
has been going on for quite a long time

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Then I will start today

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Because we are in a hurry

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will learn from his past

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In fact, there have been more than 100 years of research history in the past

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The current situation is what Vice President Liu just said

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Most recently this has been around since 2010

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
a big breakthrough of

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Also see very good prospects in patients

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
but only just started

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the future means

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
how do we go from here

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can have a bigger breakthrough

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
can bring more patients

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Then this is the mission of our Academia Sinica Research Institute

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Because we're not on the front lines caring for clinical patients

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is the job of the clinician

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But all we have to do is

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How can medical

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Problems that have not yet been resolved

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
These results can then be

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Transfer to clinic for treatment

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Then this is the expectation of our Academia Sinica

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It is also our responsibility now

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
then i will today

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
From here, the more detailed content

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Actually, last month, our weekly report in Zhongyuan Hospital

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I also wrote on the same topic, and also wrote all his Chinese

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And I found a colleague, he is an editor, so he can understand

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I believe it will be easier for everyone to understand

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What about everyone, there will be some lectures on the sidelines, and it will be on the Internet

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can also extract his PDF file

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Then my entire speech today will probably focus on this content.

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Plus some new developments

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then, let yourself vent first, lest you get too late

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So in our lab, today I'm going to have a short, last short

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let’s talk about our voice first, then the results, which is the Zhongyuan Hospital just mentioned

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That is, we need to make some breakthroughs on the basis of existing

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's use some animal models to see

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,600
Uh, how can immunotherapy go a step further, uh, to improve the effect of lung transformation?

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,200
Then this is my postdoctoral researcher Dr. Jiaren Wu

109
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,480
And the lab assistant, uh

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,280
He used to be National Taiwan University, uh, Vincent & Associates

111
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Graduating master's students

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,200
Yes, Cai Yiting

113
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,080
oh their work

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,080
What about the other thing? Today’s slides are all in Chinese.

115
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,800
that includes some animation

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,760
Then invite us to this one

117
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Mr. Zhang Fengbi from the art room, Mr. Zhang Zimin, assisted

118
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,200
come on make these slides

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,480
ok first sentence

120
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,200
This may scare many people

121
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,440
Everyone has cancer cells in their bodies, including the current

122
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
In fact, of course I can't say so, uh, sure

123
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,120
But from the evidence of many animal experiments, I will show you the evidence later

124
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,600
Maybe we all have cancer cells in our bodies

125
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
good

126
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,440
So why are most of us still cancer-free?

127
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,040
that's because we

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
no immune system

129
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
help you in

130
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
overcome

131
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,820
against these cancer cells

132
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,200
then let me first introduce

133
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,860
Cancers that are common in Taiwan and the world

134
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,580
this is 104 years

135
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,080
Cancer Ranking in Taiwan

136
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,420
In fact, almost none of these have changed.

137
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,920
Lung cancer in the first three years

138
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,340
Liver cancer Muscle intestine Spinal bowel

139
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,000
Fatty bowel, liver cancer, colorectal cancer

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,840
Look at the world ranking

141
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
he

142
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:36,960
The top few are lung cancer, brain cancer and colorectal cancer

143
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,460
So your brain cancer ranks fourth in Taiwan

144
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,960
But it is second in the world

145
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
highest death rate

146
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,260
The highest death rate is lung cancer

147
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,940
Then came liver cancer, then colon cancer

148
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,500
So this is our common

149
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,160
Right now it's been going on for 20+ years

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,160
Cancer is the first of the top ten experiments

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
So the shape of human disease will actually change

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,240
related to our medical technology

153
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,920
I'll show you guys later

154
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,840
is how medical technology

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
How to change the shape of our disease

156
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Now everyone is most afraid of cancer

157
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,240
but 50 years ago

158
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,640
Everyone is most afraid that it is not cancer

159
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,320
is another disease

160
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,640
many infectious diseases

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Another point is the treatment of cancer

162
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,640
The most effective cancer treatment available now

163
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
should be detected early

164
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
if you catch cancer early

165
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
no matter what treatment

166
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
its cure rate

167
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
are very high

168
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
For example, take this example

169
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
this colorectal cancer

170
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
colorectal cancer

171
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
colorectal cancer in this place

172
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Original colorectal cancer

173
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
when you find out

174
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
If it belongs to the early

175
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Doctors have many ways to control

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Surgical disaster was probably the first

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
In addition, you can use local radiation therapy

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But if this IC package spreads

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Diffusion is about leaving this original position

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Transfer to Hall 08 Vascular

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
For example, in this case it will go through this dry portal vein

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The dry portal vein is where our intestines

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
a very important source of blood supply

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
With this dry portal vein

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The IC package will spread to the first station

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
just do it

187
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Many colorectal cancer patients

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
may exceed 50%

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
after diagnosis

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
dry transfer

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
25%

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Another 45% were found to have dry metastases after treatment

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So if we can detect early

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
before dry transfer

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
able to treat patients of this size

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Colorectal cancer has a very high cure rate

197
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
What's more

198
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
This is it

199
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
metastatic cancer

200
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,440
In fact, it is the biggest difficulty in our treatment.

201
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Once the cancer has metastasized

202
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
In fact, we have very few weapons at our disposal.

203
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,940
chemotherapy

204
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
Still the first-line drug

205
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
additional targeted therapy

206
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,940
But these are very difficult

207
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
completely cured

208
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,940
The patient with metastatic cancer

209
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Immunotherapy until now

210
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
start to see

211
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
seems to be ok

212
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,940
it can be cured

213
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Metastatic cancer in the past

214
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,940
You rarely use a term like cure

215
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Most of the past

216
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
years of survival

217
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
one year survival rate

218
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
three-year survival rate

219
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
five-year survival rate

220
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,940
rarely cured

221
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
so now we can start talking slowly

222
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
It seems that some patients

223
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
seems to be cured

224
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
But since I haven't observed long enough

225
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
So it takes experience

226
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
But from the current data

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,900
Looking at these data, it looks like he is very rich, very rich

228
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,680
that this

229
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,980
The research is published in very top journals called Nature journals

230
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,640
You may have heard

231
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,060
That's actually this

232
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,360
It turns out that I like to use it as a reference

233
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
to prove that it is possible that every normal human body

234
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
may be cancerous

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,060
That's how he does it, he does this experiment

236
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,060
signature

237
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,740
Then inject some chemical natural substances into this experimental department

238
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,780
It seems that we usually come into contact with some natural substances

239
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,080
You eat the sun that shines inside our environment

240
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,140
Some natural substances exist, so we have been exposed to

241
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,360
Then this experiment he found

242
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,580
He injected these natural substances, a few mice

243
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,960
a tumor

244
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,260
then he knocks him out

245
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,100
What he really wants to ask is, and

246
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,960
what about most mice

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,240
after two hundred days

248
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,740
looks healthy

249
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,240
so he asked a few questions

250
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,940
First, these contacts

251
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,440
Rats exposed to chemicals from tap water 200 days ago

252
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,940
inside his body

253
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,740
Are there cancer cells?

254
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,840
This is the first question

255
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,640
The second question is

256
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,440
if he

257
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
These mice have cancer cells in them

258
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
why doesn't he grow into a cancer

259
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Why does it still look healthy

260
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
The third question is

261
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,640
Is that because of the protection provided by the immune system in these mice

262
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,640
So he aimed at this experiment to answer these questions

263
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,140
His method is very simple

264
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,640
Because in the laboratory where we do immunization

265
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,140
have some tools

266
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,140
We can regulate, control our immune system

267
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,640
For example

268
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,740
For example this, if

269
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,320
The immune system provides protection

270
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,000
Then if we destroy the immunity of this mouse

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,920
So if the mouse has cancer cells

272
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,160
Will it grow out then?

273
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,160
So logically it should be easy to understand

274
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,400
So that's really how it works

275
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,280
It can use some antibody drugs

276
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,120
different types of immune cells

277
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,040
clear up destroy

278
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,800
it turns out that

279
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,120
If you destroy the immune cells of the mice

280
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,600
especially cell

281
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
this is us tonight

282
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,280
The most important protagonist of all is to lift the cells

283
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,680
it found that fifty percent of the mice

284
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,040
You see it's here two hundred days later

285
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,440
It puts this antibody drug in

286
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,760
destroy our immune cells

287
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
As a result, once it destroys the cell

288
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,840
You can see that more than half of the mice grow out of their seeds

289
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,760
So this experiment clearly proves that

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
In mice that had been exposed to chemicals

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
must have cancer cells

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's just the mouse's immune system

293
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Especially the protection provided by kick cells

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So although it has cancer cells, it can coexist peacefully with it

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's fine if it doesn't grow cancer

296
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
so think about it

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That means we can be exposed to chemicals that may be more

298
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
chemical source may be more

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We have native objects in the environment

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There are chemical origins and physical origins

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There are also some viruses that come from

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But most of us are actually pretty healthy.

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He has to thank our immune system

304
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do we really have cancer cells in our body?

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's actually hard to judge

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This may depend on our most sophisticated

307
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Cancer cell detection system

308
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well, now it’s probably CT, this kind of computerized tomography

309
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The computerized tomography scan, we all know its sensitivity

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If it is about 0.3 cm to 0.5 cm, it is difficult to confirm

311
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
a little bit, the size of a grain of rice

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But everyone knows this, how many cancer cells are there in a tumor of this size

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hundreds of millions, that is to say, the sensitivity of our current detection

314
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
For example, below 0.3 cm, it is actually difficult for us to detect this kind of

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But there are already very, very many cancer cells in it.

316
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Fortunately, most of the immune types are healthy.

317
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The other thing is that we have to take care of our immune system

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then let it work normally

319
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So maintaining a healthy lifestyle has become very important

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,320
Next, I will talk about immunotherapy from the beginning.

321
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,200
The Past of Cancer Immunotherapy

322
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,480
This is about a very young doctor at that time.

323
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,240
Called Dr. Corley

324
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,600
This Dr. Corley was around the end of the 19th century

325
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,360
he is a surgeon

326
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,520
At that time there was only one treatment for cancer

327
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
It's surgery

328
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,040
Traditional Therapeutic Radiation Today

329
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,160
Madam Juju hadn't discovered

330
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,440
chemotherapy not yet

331
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,120
Don't put off treatment later

332
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,000
The only thing is to cut

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Dr. Corley found

334
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,920
he observed clinically

335
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,480
In fact, many of our medical advances are like this

336
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,240
Just start from observation

337
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,600
then you will be curious

338
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
Curiosity triggers your research motivation

339
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,040
he found out

340
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,960
He found a patient in Fresh Stand

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
With his surgeon expertise, he thinks this patient probably won't live long.

342
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
However, this patient developed a bacterial infection during hospitalization.

343
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He thought at that time, there were no antibiotics for humans

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Bacterial infection is very serious

345
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Then some patients may not make it through, and some patients may survive.

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He discovered this Fresh Dan bacterial infection, repeated bacterial infections

347
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But it is strange that after his bacterial infection is cured, he always disappears

348
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So this was a big shock to him.

349
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Because for his profession, the cancer he judged is already a terminal cancer patient.

350
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
how can it be good

351
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So he put forward a hypothesis

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
In fact, you see, our science is all about observation, making hypotheses, and making bold assumptions.

353
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Be careful next time

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Then he did it and came up with a hypothesis. He thought maybe it was a bacterial infection and it was cured.

355
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
This Freshden's cancer

356
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,320
Then he went back to find their hospital

357
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,920
this new york cancer hospital

358
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,120
Is there a similar case

359
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,320
As a result, he found more than 30 similar cases

360
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,800
Bacterial infection occurs

361
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,280
As a result, almost half of the cancer disappeared

362
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,760
So this caused him to be more active

363
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,680
So he started to execute the first

364
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,560
looks dangerous now

365
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,280
a so-called human experiment

366
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,800
He finds the next patient to see him

367
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,640
Called Signal Zola

368
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,440
Everyone look at this, he has a photo to keep

369
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,680
have invested in

370
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,560
Then it has metastasized to the lungs and variable glands

371
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,880
This patient probably won't live long.

372
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,160
Then this case will carry out his clinical trial

373
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,880
Bacteria

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
injected into his tumor

375
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
In the end, I called once, twice, three times, but it didn't seem to work.

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He also does not cause infection

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Of course the tumor is fine

378
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Then he wondered if his bacteria wasn't doing well

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I found this one

380
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Those who have attended junior high school, high school, or religious studies

381
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is the famous Koho

382
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
father of bacteriology

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He's the one who came up with the Koho collimator

384
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
german science prize

385
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
just go ask him

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
because he invented a way to grow bacteria

387
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So you get the purest, most powerful bacteria

388
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
As a result, after he injected the bacteria

389
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Sure enough, it caused a serious bacterial infection.

390
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
chills, nausea, vomiting, fever

391
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This isolated symptom occurs

392
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
This is a serious bacterial infection

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
if found

394
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Symptoms of this bacterial infection

395
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
What did you find?

396
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,920
This patient has cancer in his head

397
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,640
It disappeared completely within two weeks.

398
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
Cancer is also under control

399
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,200
Then the patient will be discharged

400
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,600
This was supposed to last a few weeks

401
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,360
eight more years

402
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,520
But then his cancer came back

403
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,560
But these eight years are earned

404
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
The healthy ones lived for eight years

405
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,120
What about Koho?

406
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
the collie

407
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,080
he invented

408
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,880
He thought he was doing the right thing

409
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
for treatment

410
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,800
Therefore, during his decades as a criminal doctor

411
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,880
He published about 1500 cases

412
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,520
he has 500 cases

413
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,320
is effective for cancer

414
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,320
is one third

415
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,720
This is actually from the current point of view

416
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,160
It is also an unlikely figure

417
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,720
but it's a pity to say

418
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,240
At that time, everyone didn't know about immunology

419
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
no basis in immunology

420
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,000
don't know how it works

421
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,040
Its biggest problem is that it can do it well and others can't do it

422
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,080
other people's consciousness can't do it

423
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,320
for any medical action

424
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,200
The method of medical treatment must be repeated

425
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,520
That is to say, I did it at National Taiwan University.

426
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
It should be done in City University

427
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,000
Otherwise, if you only rely on some individual reports

428
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,120
The absence of recurrence does not actually constitute an effective medical

429
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,720
So this is what we need to do clinical trials

430
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,320
Different levels of clinical trials are a big reason

431
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:47,080
So an early result of this Coly like this

432
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,400
have received little attention from the medical profession.

433
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,360
Slowly, after a few years

434
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,640
Mrs. Gilly found Ray

435
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,800
then start

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,360
Even entered the era of Radiation radiation therapy

437
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,720
Then around 1940

438
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,720
Discovery of chemical drug that kills cancer cells

439
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,520
entered the era of chemotherapy

440
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,880
then around 2000

441
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,000
It was found that cancer cells have mutations in some genes than normal cells

442
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,720
That can use some drugs to control these mutant receptors

443
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,360
This is called targeted therapy

444
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,240
it's listed here

445
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,400
Surgery Radiotherapy Chemotherapy Targeted Therapy

446
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,320
Then this constitutes the mainstream of cancer treatment now.

447
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,000
Immunotherapy has been only in academia

448
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,280
And even in academia people don't quite believe

449
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,400
until recently

450
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,360
These are the developments that I want to introduce to you after today.

451
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:54,860
good

452
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,720
Alright, the next thing I want to do is to introduce to you

453
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the body's immune system

454
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The immune system is not actually developed to treat cancer

455
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because of our surrounding environment

456
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
There have always been a lot of vitamins

457
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Everyone is protected by the immune system without realizing it.

458
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
you don't know how precious it is

459
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
because everyone looks healthy

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But you need to know the importance of the immune system to health

461
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
it's actually really easy

462
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You can know it from immunocompromised patients

463
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If the patient

464
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Whether congenital or acquired

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
lack of immune system

466
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
He can't survive under normal circumstances

467
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Like a famous example called Bobble Child

468
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
His innate immune switch

469
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He lives in a segregated village

470
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
and then all the activities

471
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
must be performed in a sterile environment

472
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Generally speaking, it is normal for us

473
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
These dimensional creatures are not at all a problem

474
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Probably well known to him

475
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,260
The immune system is actually helping us deal with all these creatures

476
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
This is innate, each of us has

477
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,560
We just need to learn now

478
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,460
How to apply it and train it

479
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,460
Let it help us fight the disease

480
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,260
But the immune system is actually doing two things at once

481
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
it should have heard font immune disease

482
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,300
If immune hyperactivation

483
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,700
or it was supposed to attack dimensional creatures

484
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,200
If it turns out to attack your own cells,

485
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
that's an autoimmune disease

486
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,000
Font immune disease is actually very difficult to treat

487
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,300
related to genetics

488
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,300
So how to control the immune system

489
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,700
Make it able to deal with alien invading dimensional creatures

490
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If it's cancer, let it fight the cancer

491
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,400
But don't kill your own cells

492
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
then become a big

493
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
an important area

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Then I will briefly introduce

495
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
immune system

496
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
all immune cells

497
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
it has an immune

498
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Blast cells that we call bone marrow

499
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
hematopoietic stem cells

500
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Called Hematopoietis stem cells

501
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
In adults these hematopoietic stem cells

502
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
is the marrow in our bones

503
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Look at the red bone marrow

504
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That hematopoietic stem cell

505
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It will be divided into two categories

506
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Myeloid Globlasts

507
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
or lymphoblast

508
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
bone marrow blast

509
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
responsible for making our blood cells

510
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
erythrocyte

511
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
it has a lot of phagocytes

512
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
We are called white blood cells

513
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
so you see white blood cells

514
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Another large group we call lymphoblasts

515
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
These lymphoblasts are responsible for making T lymphocytes

516
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And B lymphocytes

517
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Everyone has heard of antibodies

518
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Antibodies are mainly after activation of B lymphocytes

519
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
These proteins that are produced and secreted into the blood

520
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Can recognize external whys

521
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
entire immune system

522
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The most important category is probably this

523
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
that you want to phagocyte

524
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Phagocyte encounters bacteria within the first instant

525
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
devour it

526
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We use the following reality to explain

527
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Write a few slides for everyone to see

528
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
This is seen with an electron microscope

529
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
This is a white blood cell

530
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
erythrocyte

531
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Red blood cells are much more numerous than white blood cells

532
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So let's look at red first

533
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,020
It is difficult for you to distinguish the electronic behavior of white blood cells

534
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,520
Which are phagocytes

535
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,020
Which ones are mention cells? They look similar

536
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,020
But if you do some special dyeing

537
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Like the hematology department, he can go to draw blood after it comes out

538
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,020
He can do some special dyes and you'll see this form

539
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,780
Let's say these are red blood cells

540
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,020
Those are the white blood cells.

541
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,160
You see, the white blood cells look different, but here they look the same

542
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,380
It doesn't look the same on this side, it's just a four-neutral

543
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
leukocyte

544
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,860
This is a mononuclear ball

545
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
Then this should be a four-acid white blood cell

546
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,700
If you get leukemia

547
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,860
you'll find that certain types of this

548
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,300
A large increase in the number of white blood cells

549
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Next, I will introduce to you

550
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
I clearly want to know how to deal with foreigners for a living

551
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Everyone, look at this secret

552
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
These tubular systems

553
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
These are called lymphatic vessels

554
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And what about these little black balls?

555
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
want lymph nodes

556
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
After the blood cells are made from that bone marrow

557
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
climbed into the blood vessel

558
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Then search for blood vessels all over the body

559
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
with lymphatic circulation

560
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
first person to find it

561
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
if found

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It sends out the function of going straight to destroy the invading creatures

563
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
can't find it

564
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
it has a certain lifespan

565
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
it will die

566
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
after death

567
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Our modeling mother cells continue to make these white blood cells

568
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So let's maintain a certain balance

569
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,000

570
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
if cancer

571
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,000

572
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Chemo here has serious side effects

573
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
That is, it will cause the white blood cells to drop

574
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
Of course this becomes very susceptible to nosocomial infections

575
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,720
In fact, because chemotherapy drugs will kill our hematopoietic mother cells

576
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,960
After killing, its ability to produce white blood cells declines

577
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,520
will become less

578
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,080
So these phagocytes in our body

579
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,680
It will be the first time of course there are aliens as creatures once invaded

580
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,520
It will be the first time these alien creatures

581
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
swallow

582
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
So everyone phagocytes

583
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,520
I'll show you this video later

584
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,520
After swallowing, of course, many bacteria are controlled in this way

585
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,520
But some are more pathogenic

586
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
it is not afraid of phagocytes

587
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,520
Like the phagocytic cells I mentioned, it has another characteristic

588
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
it will after phagocytosis bacteria

589
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,520
it transforms into what are called antigen presenting cells

590
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,520
It will carry this germ, the devoured germ

591
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Enter the 08 system

592
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Go to Section 08

593
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
In Section 08, it will encounter the T cell just mentioned

594
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Then this antigen presenting cell is exposed to activate 08 cell in section 08

595
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
triggers a germ-specific immune response

596
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Then what about these 08 cells

597
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Through blood circulation and 08 circulation

598
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
find invading bacteria

599
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
destroy it

600
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This is how all our immune systems work

601
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Then I will show you the video now

602
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
this is a phagocyte

603
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
an electron to kill bacteria

604
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
a microscope film

605
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
wait a minute

606
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Here spread a neutrophil is

607
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
red blood cells in the middle

608
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,780
Because some people may not understand English well

609
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,280
i was explaining

610
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
This is a four middle white blood cell

611
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,460
it's just bacteria

612
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,960
it's just red blood cells

613
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Staphylococcus aureus

614
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,520
start chasing this

615
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Chemicals in the middle of bacteria four

616
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,200
attract it to chase

617
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So the Uighurs it produces are called phagocytes

618
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So it's called a phagocyte

619
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
right

620
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
oh no

621
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
this it has some that

622
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
that

623
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Adjustment

624
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
so you see it says

625
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
if you use those

626
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
To see our body's detailed multi-dimensional organisms

627
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Once the software is hacked

628
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Phagocytes will immediately

629
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
become a cell

630
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
so it is

631
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
After hacking software

632
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Phagocytes immediately go after it

633
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
that swallows it up

634
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
After talking about devouring

635
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
it will go to section 08 first

636
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
present antigen to cells

637
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
so this is the first step

638
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Phagocytosis

639
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
ok then let's

640
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
look at

641
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
next

642
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Subtitler Zither Harp

643
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, here, this one looks like bacteria, over there hairs, bacteria are completely different from our human cells

644
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So for the immune system, this job is very easy, it is very easy, it is easy to distinguish which are bacteria and which are cells of our limbs

645
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:33,000
It does not attack its own cells, it attacks bacteria, and bacteria have some special structures, which we call pathogen-associated molecular structures

646
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Those who speak English don’t need to read it, because the fraiserin means to become hairy

647
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Then there are some components called lipopolisaccharide, cell B, bacterial cell B, human cells do not have cell B

648
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So of course there is no lps, but the plate below is its receptor, the receptor that recognizes these molecular structures

649
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Some of these receptors recognize different molecular structures

650
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So this is the principle why our phagocytic cells can find bacteria and viruses to swallow them

651
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Phagocytosis when bacteria just don't see V. aureus being phagocytized by our secondary neutrophils

652
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
One thing happens after devouring

653
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Just looking for our artist, is it a big principle or how bacteria phagocytosis

654
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It will have a different molecular structure on the bacteria due to phagocytosis

655
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
In addition to devouring it, it actually activates it

656
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
it gets fierce

657
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's pretty empty after phagocytizing bacteria

658
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
an activated phagocyte

659
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Activated phagocytes have

660
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,820
Ability to present antigens to T cells

661
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,500
If you are just one of these

662
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,080
original antigenicity

663
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,640
It presents to T cells that function is actually poor

664
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,980
What about activated antigen-presenting cells?

665
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,980
It can present antigens, which are derived from bacteria

666
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,360
right if it's kennzer

667
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,220
tumor antigen

668
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,440
But, it also needs to represent co-stimulatory molecules

669
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,220
It has to represent cell technology

670
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,780
This is only activated

671
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,780
Phagocytes, which look fierce, have this ability

672
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Then

673
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,580
Next this activated phagocyte

674
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,080
I just talked about antigens, it shows antigens, a little bit of red

675
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,000
co-stimulatory molecular cell technology

676
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
act together on a single T cell

677
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,960
When T cells activate

678
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Split

679
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
differentiation

680
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
he lived a long time

681
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
What about T cells like this?

682
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
He was also a very kind T cell

683
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
After being educated by antigen presenting cells

684
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
He'll also turn into an empty T-cell

685
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
and he will split

686
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He has an immunity, that system has a characteristic

687
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that is, T cells

688
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
A certain type of T cell, such as the T cell activated by this bacterium

689
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
He can only recognize this bacterium

690
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
He doesn't care about other enemies

691
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
For example, if I'm working on the hepatitis B virus

692
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
What if antigenic phagocytes present this hepatitis B virus

693
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
antigen to this T cell

694
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The trained T cells only recognize liver B

695
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He doesn't care about other enemies

696
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
This is what vaccines do

697
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
After we have a certain vaccine

698
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
these immune responses

699
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,600
Only recognize this vaccine

700
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,900
other viruses

701
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
sorry he doesn't care

702
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,600
So we have to find the right antigen

703
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,000
to elicit a response to this antigen

704
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,100
T cell response

705
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,300
That

706
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,100
microorganism

707
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,600
You can easily know what his antigen is

708
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,200
But cancer is hard for you to know

709
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,900
cancer cells

710
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,000
It's actually a change in your own cells

711
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,700
It's actually very, very similar to your own cells

712
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,800
I just talked about the immune system

713
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,000
actually training

714
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,700
exist

715
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,000
in the process of growing

716
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,500
it will have received an education

717
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,200
We call it negative selection

718
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,300
in immune cells

719
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,400
Trained in T cells

720
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,200
It does not recognize antigens on its own cells

721
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,900
avoid autoimmune disease

722
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,500
But because the i cells are different from your own cells

723
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,400
almost the same

724
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,800
So the immune system basically doesn't recognize him

725
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,700
or don't want to know him

726
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,300
In this situation

727
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,900
Is there a way to train the immune system

728
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,700
separate

729
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,800
because of i-cell disease

730
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
Now scientific research is more and more clear

731
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,680
found that although it looks a lot alike

732
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
but not exactly the same

733
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,680
Because if it's exactly the same it won't become a cancer cell

734
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,180
So we find some differences

735
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
train your immune system

736
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,680
to identify these differences

737
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,180
if it really works

738
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,180
It can specifically attack cancer cells

739
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Achieve the effect of healing Kensel

740
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,680
So there is actually a concept here

741
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,680
The immune system is inactive under normal conditions

742
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,680
It only activates when it touches an enemy

743
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
when the enemy is eliminated

744
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,680
It means that those activated cells will die in large numbers

745
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,680
So this is what was just said

746
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
These T cells have several properties

747
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
the first one it will split a lot

748
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,680
When you encounter, say, the hepatitis B virus

749
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,680
To deal with liver B, the T cells will divide in large numbers

750
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
This number becomes many

751
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,400
You can effectively control invasive sanitary species

752
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,040
The second is medical expertise

753
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,160
activated T cells

754
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,400
I only know this one virus that invaded

755
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,200
it doesn't care

756
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,600
So sometimes we have to get a lot of vaccines

757
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,400
play a dozen

758
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,360
train different T cells

759
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,640
different G8,G9 cells

760
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,800
against different bacteria

761
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,800
and memory

762
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,600
after a vaccination

763
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,040
some are lifetime

764
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,640
Because T cells are constantly replicating molecules by themselves

765
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,600
knitting

766
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,040
So when we meet again next time

767
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,640
It can be trained very quickly

768
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,360
So it has these basic properties

769
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
Expertise and memory

770
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,360
this is very good

771
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,240
because our cancer cells

772
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,240
We want to train T cells

773
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,880
only medical

774
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,640
it only targets cancer cells

775
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
not to deal with our normal cells

776
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,640
memory is also very good

777
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
your metastatic cancer cells

778
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,400
not yet killed

779
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,920
But we have T cells if they are still there

780
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,840
It can help you train again in the long run

781
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Then you don't care where the diversion is to hide

782
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Your T-C bag can track it

783
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Then achieve the effect of long-term control

784
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
like just saw that mouse

785
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It actually has cancer cells

786
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
But because it has a sound immune system, it is not afraid

787
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It can still maintain a roughly healthy state of life

788
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Then let me show you

789
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's the trained T-C bag, it's useless to stay in Section 08

790
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Because its enemy is not in the 08 section

791
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It goes to find its invading vitamins, which are bacteria.

792
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
If it's a cancer cell, it finds the metastatic cancer cells

793
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It can't just stay in section 08

794
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Then there are some complicated principles

795
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
then i will describe a little bit

796
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
watch a video later

797
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That's a viral infection

798
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
1 The phagocytic cell will of course swallow it

799
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
After swallowing it, it will also be at the site of the infection

800
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,160
inflammatory reaction

801
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,500
Inflammatory reaction?

802
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,140
At this time, there will actually be some

803
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,160
compartmentalizing hormone and adsorbin

804
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,720
present at the site of infection

805
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
capillaries

806
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
above blood vessels

807
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,580
these in the blood

808
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,160
White blood cells when it goes in

809
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,540
It interacts with these adsorbed proteins

810
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,840
Then the white blood cells

811
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Can

812
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,060
won't leave so quickly

813
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,660
It rolls over the infection site

814
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,660
out of shape

815
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,020
divert transfer into our organization

816
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,860
compartmentalization

817
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,060
find inflamed tissue

818
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,360
The inflamed tissue is actually the site of the infection.

819
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,560
Then by looping like this

820
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,960
can be expelled from the blood vessel

821
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,460
leave blood vessel

822
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,560
Find where the enemy is attacking

823
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
If it's cancer, find the cancer cells

824
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,860
If it is a bacterial infection, find the site of the bacterial infection

825
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
to destroy it

826
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
OK, let's see what happens next.

827
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
then you cut the video

828
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,120
Lukasite is white

829
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,620
Usually it's inside a blood vessel

830
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,620
It's the inflamed area

831
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,620
Bacterial infection releases cytokines

832
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,620
blood vessels at the site of infection

833
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Expressed Adsorbin

834
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
to break

835
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,400
Appraisal component

836
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Identify the parts of the ingredients

837
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,080
make them close

838
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,080
sugars on white blood cells

839
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
combine

840
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,080
They start rolling in the veins

841
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,080
sugars on white blood cells

842
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,080
They start rolling in the veins

843
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,080
or by cell

844
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
really insist

845
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Enter

846
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
then the inflamed area

847
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,080
Parts that have not been identified

848
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Then find the inflamed site, which is the site of bacterial infection, and eliminate it

849
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
it's a live animation

850
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Here everyone see, this is an artery

851
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This is the front

852
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
This direction is the direction of blood flow

853
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Probably the flow speed is very fast, but in fact there are many, many blood cells

854
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Then some white blood cells are absorbed here

855
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
some of them have entered the organization

856
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
You see, all these blood cells are absorbed in the veins

857
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
The arterial bleeds, blood cells cannot absorb

858
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
thanks then , some are crawling

859
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
some have gone in

860
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
then if you

861
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
This, this has entered the organization

862
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
This has entered your organization

863
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
out of blood vessels into tissue

864
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It is for you to see the cells inside the blood vessel

865
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,400
clamp the blood vessels

866
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,000
So you see, so many cells can't flow now

867
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,600
So you can see, very, very cells inside that blood vessel

868
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,400
then turn it on

869
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
blood starts flowing again

870
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,600
As soon as you let it go, it starts flowing again

871
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So our blood vessels are full of these blood vessels

872
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So, the T cells after education

873
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Involved in blood vessels

874
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Then, through the effect just mentioned called adsorption

875
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
find the enemy it wants to attack

876
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
then go in and destroy it

877
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
ok , let ' s see next

878
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Lukasites are white blood cells

879
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,140
ok then next

880
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:15,100
Actually I don't know

881
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,940
But it doesn’t seem to be because oil should be fat, it’s in the blood, I think

882
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,500
When it is very oily, there will be a lot of that and that lipid in it

883
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,800
Will this ingredient be in it?

884
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,920
It causes the blood cells not to absorb and don’t imagine that the principle of water pipes is not the same

885
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,540
But will it be true? In fact, when we do science, there is evidence to speak for itself. So

886
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,300
don't know

887
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,600
but

888
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,640
It must be bad for your health

889
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,000
especially for that new blood vessel

890
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,800
sure it must be bad

891
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,360
then next is

892
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,900
Didn't he just go in

893
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,160
Is the inflamed area right?

894
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,980
So if you find that infected cell, how does he kill him?

895
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,520
show him next

896
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,060
current

897
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,600
this this video this is a

898
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,140
electron microscope photo

899
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,120
A is the target cell is the Target Cell

900
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,920
So this could be a virus-infected cell

901
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,320
or cancer cells

902
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,900
Then this CTL

903
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,240
These are called killer T cells

904
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,060
Here I am called T cell, this is it

905
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,480
Then it recognizes the antigen by this

906
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,520
followed by T cell binding

907
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,440
Atrophy of target cells after binding

908
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,920
Within minutes the target cells begin to shrink

909
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,680
Because after it combines it will dissolve some mold

910
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,720
combined it creates a channel

911
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,720
Let this killer, some lytic mold in this T cell

912
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,200
Injected through this channel

913
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,760
This target cell to attack

914
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,160
Then the dissolving mold will work after it goes in.

915
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,200
Let the target cell start shrinking in a few minutes

916
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,140
Then its cell membrane will form some protruding small bubbles

917
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,980
Then the last cell dies

918
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,120
die

919
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,300
After that, everyone, everyone, look at the holes one by one.

920
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,640
this is in

921
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,020
Add ginger cells to break through

922
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,380
what is this cell

923
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,020
this is the whole process

924
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,120
I'll come then

925
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,100
control the time

926
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,060
We haven't even talked about the protagonist Ai Zheng yet.

927
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,360
Don't let him talk for so long

928
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,080
Let everyone see it directly

929
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
good

930
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
This is a white blood cell

931
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,340
This is a T cell

932
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,440
This is the target cell, the antigen on it

933
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,340
then after combining it with

934
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,920
will dissolve some concentrated mold

935
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,220
inject into

936
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,580
target cell

937
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,100
that makes the target cell die

938
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,380
we'll see next

939
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,940
there should be one

940
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:12,040
This is a virus-infected cell

941
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,300
before he was killed

942
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,600
He keeps releasing these viruses

943
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,880
He will kill himself and the virus will come out

944
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,960
We kill after TGPOL passes

945
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,760
Of course he won't know about the virus after killing it

946
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,360
So this is a principle of controlling viral infection

947
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,000
He has electron microscope pictures next

948
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,060
This is one of his Target Sales

949
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,120
This is white shoes

950
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,400
after combining

951
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,200
He now has a channel called Bridge

952
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,740
dissolve some mold

953
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,540
everyone see

954
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:48,120
inject it

955
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,480
After injection, it causes the shrinkage of the target cells

956
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,000
the cell membrane

957
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,060
transmission

958
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,360
look at it

959
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,880
in transmission

960
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:12,000
In the end, the cell is too big to die.

961
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
produce some small bubbles, then decompose

962
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
This T cell, it can find its next enemy

963
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
If this is an I cell, that's hopefully going to happen

964
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
And it's I cells, wherever they hide, T cells have the ability to find them

965
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Next, what is immunotherapy?

966
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
The first one is really using your own body

967
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
In fact, it should be that you use your own body's immune system

968
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
to cure disease

969
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
immunotherapy

970
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Here are some examples

971
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
or immune watermelon, or immune-related proteins

972
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
To treat a disease, it's called immunotherapy

973
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
There are two categories, active immunotherapy and passive immunotherapy

974
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Active is immunotherapy, that is, using some drugs or vaccines

975
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Activate the patient's own immune miniature

976
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
That is to say, this immune miniature is actually not stimulated, but stimulated.

977
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
For example, the vaccine itself does not have the ability to resist bacteria

978
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
It triggers the immune system of the immunized person, and it produces a protective effect

979
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So the real active people are produced by the vaccine

980
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:40,000
So this is what we call active immunization, for example, you are injected with type B liver cancer vaccine

981
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Afterwards, the injected baby will produce specialized comprehensive antibodies

982
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Then it is no longer afraid of hepatitis B virus infection

983
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So this antibody is produced by the baby, not injected by us

984
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So this is what we call active immunotherapy

985
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Then there are some critical situations

986
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Because it takes a while for a vaccine to develop

987
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Then when you are infected by a virus

988
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
it can't wait that long

989
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
it just keeps replicating

990
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Waiting until your grass is not easy to produce is already bad

991
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
So when you say you accidentally get rubbed on your body

992
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And know that this is like the love stagnation virus

993
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
There is this heteromorphic hepatic heart virus

994
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Then you can no longer use vaccines at this time

995
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Because it's too late

996
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
At this time, a large amount of antibodies are injected into the

997
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So this antibody is produced by our event

998
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
then type in

999
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So is tetanus

1000
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
you got rubbed by that rusty nail

1001
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Hurry up and call

1002
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That tetanus is vaccinated

1003
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
but some are poisonous

1004
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Snake venom is directly injected with snake venom serum

1005
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Synthesize the bacteria or virus

1006
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
or these toxins they produce

1007
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
This is called passive immunity

1008
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,600
are now used as cancer immunizers

1009
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,500
The next example in this period will come to an end.

1010
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,100
our body's immune system

1011
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,300
The immune person that everyone does not know in the body

1012
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,600
It turned out to be so effective

1013
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,100
But his example might scare me

1014
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,300
in roman times

1015
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,900
The average human life span is only in their 20s

1016
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,400
His so-called life is

1017
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,800
as long as you are born

1018
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,800
with death

1019
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,000
The death of the little baby is also counted

1020
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,100
because at that time

1021
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,700
think about it

1022
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:32,700
that's us now

1023
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,800
Born in Taiwan

1024
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,200
You get a dozen different vaccines

1025
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
why? because

1026
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,000
Babies are very susceptible to infection

1027
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,400
He may have received his mother in the first half of the year

1028
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,000
mother protection

1029
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,400
if breastfeeding

1030
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,300
but after that

1031
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,200
He needs to immunize himself

1032
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,500
to protect himself

1033
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,500
But for a while, it's actually quite dangerous

1034
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,000
So need to be vaccinated

1035
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,400
to accelerate the effect of this protection

1036
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Even in medieval England in the 1500s

1037
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Its overall average condition is still around 30 years

1038
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
it's been a long time now

1039
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Now both Japan and Taiwan are 80 years old

1040
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But some countries are still at 50

1041
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
In fact, this is a very important human invention

1042
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
is the vaccine

1043
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I just said that vaccines are actually active immunity.

1044
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
You see how well this vaccine protects us

1045
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
These are what you see in Taiwan

1046
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Almost the world's little despicable

1047
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
vaccines to be given

1048
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
For example, like the small ringgit vaccine

1049
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Over 21,000 cases in 1952

1050
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
now zero

1051
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You see everything else is like this

1052
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
so in the 1950s

1053
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
If you look at the top ten causes of death

1054
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
definitely more like

1055
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
completely different now

1056
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:05,920
Many of these infectious diseases should be

1057
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,560
So the shape of human disease is changing

1058
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,560
the vaccine was invented

1059
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,780
So our lifespan is extended

1060
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:15,040
After the extension, we will face another form of disease

1061
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,640
cancer

1062
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,600
So now cancer is our worst enemy

1063
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,320
But come to think of it, vaccines

1064
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,160
Help us deal with the top killers of our past

1065
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,780
Is there any way to use the same method now

1066
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,260
to activate the immune system

1067
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,440
Then it's not about dealing with alien dimensional creatures at this time.

1068
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,280
It's to deal with the cancer cells after the transformation of your body's cells

1069
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,720
Is there a way for the immune system to achieve this character?

1070
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,360
So we're going to introduce you to

1071
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,360
Then the system he uses is just introduced to you

1072
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,440
What are these killers?

1073
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,960
Phagocytes or T cells

1074
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,160
still these things

1075
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,160
good

1076
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Here are the top 10 causes of death

1077
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Cancer is now number one

1078
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Probably close to 30%

1079
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But it wasn't like that in the 1950s

1080
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:19,000
That's because a lot of the big part is the vaccine development wages

1081
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Next comes cancer cells, cancer

1082
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Cancer doesn't just pop up out of thin air.

1083
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
In fact, it is also a process, because many of you should know

1084
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
everyone has culture theory

1085
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
try to survive in the earth environment

1086
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Organisms best suited to this environment can survive

1087
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
When the environment changes you need to have some mutation

1088
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Some genetic variation is required

1089
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
This mutation makes you more suitable for this environment

1090
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
In this group, probably most of the members of the group died

1091
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
These organisms can stay because they are suitable for this environment

1092
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,340
This is called things, those who live in peace, those who live in the world

1093
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,220
Cancer cells are actually produced in this way

1094
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,500
This edited theory of what we call cancer

1095
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,500
I will use this very complicated picture to introduce it to him.

1096
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,500
The gray cells are some normal cells

1097
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,000
when it's stimulated by a number of different carcinogens

1098
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,500
Of course it will transform, and some will turn into cancer cells

1099
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,500
So I just said that many people may have cancer cells physiologically

1100
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,500
But in the early days, during the elimination period

1101
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
We have a very good and sound Burmese system here

1102
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Kill him as soon as your cancer cells come out

1103
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,500
So you don't even know, you still feel healthy

1104
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,000
Most people are in this state

1105
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
But some are still sick

1106
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,540
Cancer is becoming more and more

1107
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:02,640
this starts

1108
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,200
Because what the IC package just said

1109
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,500
survival of the fittest

1110
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,000
IC package if he is not applicable in

1111
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,700
who here chooses him

1112
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,300
who is going to attack him

1113
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:11,940
is the immune system

1114
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,600
what does he apply

1115
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,600
he has to adapt the immune system

1116
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,300
If he can adapt the immune system

1117
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,400
It's because he's not afraid of the immune system

1118
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,000
he has a chance to survive

1119
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,600
So there are some IC packages

1120
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,500
changes in his genes

1121
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,100
His ability to attack immune cells

1122
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,300
Greater tolerance

1123
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,500
So these few IC packages

1124
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,100
survive

1125
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,800
At this time, we enter the so-called coexistence period.

1126
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,800
The coexistence period is your IC package

1127
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,100
Although in

1128
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,300
But you can't go too far

1129
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,700
You just maintain a certain amount

1130
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,400
that's good

1131
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,100
I obviously controlled you first

1132
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,300
keep you out of trouble

1133
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,200
Most likely to remain in this state

1134
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,700
How to destroy this balance

1135
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,600
a balance is to say

1136
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
immune system compromised

1137
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,900
under certain conditions

1138
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:07,400
or take some immunosuppressants

1139
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,280
or other reasons for your immune system to

1140
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,700
Decreased immune protection

1141
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,700
At this time, cancer cells have a chance to win

1142
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,200
or the continued evolution of cancer cells

1143
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,920
Because your immune system is going to attack him

1144
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,220
killed by him

1145
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,920
If he survives, he will not be afraid of you

1146
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,500
So he slowly and gradually changed

1147
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,100
This process may take a year or two, maybe ten or twenty years

1148
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,000
So in the end you have some cancer cells

1149
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
After he's trained, he's less afraid of your immune system attacking.

1150
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
He has the opportunity to be under the condition of immune cell attack

1151
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
He was also able to grow a large tumor

1152
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This is a clinical tumor

1153
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
this time you will see a doctor

1154
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So that is

1155
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
You see those oncologists in the clinic

1156
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
He faces very familiar problems

1157
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
because all these cancer cells

1158
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
He is already in such a state of shock

1159
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
i'm so scared

1160
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,380
Then the IC protection of your patient's immune system

1161
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,740
grow out to grow out

1162
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,740
So you need immune drugs to control it

1163
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:06,740
Of course it's more difficult

1164
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,460
So this is the problem we face clinically

1165
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,420
how to deal with these

1166
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,580
The fighters of IC protection who have been shocked by the immune attack

1167
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,460
How to give this immune system again

1168
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,920
Stronger ability to eliminate these IC protection

1169
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,940
This is the only way to control these

1170
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,220
Clinically these IC protection

1171
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:30,560
Then this is what I just mentioned

1172
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,060
The Four Survival Ways of IC Bao

1173
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,060
Okay, let's give some more clinical examples

1174
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,960
This is the treatment of colorectal cancer

1175
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,680
This is not immunotherapy, this is traditional treatment

1176
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,180
surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy

1177
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,800
Then if you look at this A, B, C, D

1178
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,180
The four types of patients

1179
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,300
A and C

1180
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,760
You see this tumor is very small

1181
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,080
Section 08 has not yet been violated

1182
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,260
Therefore, this is usually classified as sweeping syndrome in pathological classification.

1183
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,320
It's probably fine to cut it off

1184
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,560
Then that patient B and D

1185
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,420
It's red is a cancer cell

1186
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,000
Not only in the original flavor but also violated the 08 section

1187
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,800
Then to this 08 tube

1188
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,960
So these patients are classified as

1189
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,360
This may be a pathological classification

1190
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,800
it may be more malignant

1191
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,400
Already violated tube 08 so probably transferred

1192
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,600
The prognosis may be worse

1193
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,920
Then they counted a lot of treated cases

1194
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,400
and then come to this conclusion

1195
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,960
Discover

1196
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,320
Originally this B

1197
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,040
B this A this patient looks like a small

1198
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,800
should be fine

1199
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,040
It should be fine after recovery, but he is actually not well after recovery.

1200
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,680
Then this D this patient

1201
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,840
Looks like the red tumor has invaded the 08 section

1202
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:59,440
Then maybe it was transferred, of course everyone said

1203
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
That, what Teacher Tang just said, once this is invaded, the metastatic cancer may be difficult to treat

1204
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But according to this patient, according to their statistics, this type of patient is not bad

1205
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
The big big difference is the yellow cells

1206
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
These are immune cells, especially T cells

1207
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:29,000
If this patient has a lot of 08 cells in the cancer tissue he removed

1208
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
For example, patients C and D, no matter what treatment they receive, be it chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery, they are less likely to relapse

1209
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
But if he doesn't have these T cells, he will heal longer

1210
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:53,000
This article, this is a Review Paper, which summarizes many clinical cases

1211
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Put forward a statement at that time, that is to say, in addition to the classification of these pathologies

1212
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
People also take into account the classification of immunity

1213
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
This way the prognosis for this cancer patient will be more accurate.

1214
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
This is the conclusion obtained in patients with colorectal cancer

1215
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Even other cancers were later found to have similar conclusions

1216
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
That is to say

1217
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Some patients have cancer because more T cells enter the lung

1218
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
This kind of patient is easier

1219
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
No matter what you do to treat him, it will be easier.

1220
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
next to ask

1221
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Why do these patients have more T cells

1222
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I don't know

1223
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
This is what we need to understand in our research

1224
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
The next challenge of positive treatment is to say

1225
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Why Only a Few Patients Have Better T Cells

1226
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
if not

1227
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Is there any way you can make it happen

1228
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That's what everyone said at the beginning

1229
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
we generate

1230
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,220
He's phagocytosis, remember, phagocytosis

1231
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,440
after swallowing bacteria

1232
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,200
Bacterial antigens carried

1233
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,020
presented to the T cell, which produces

1234
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,320
Right, so we're actually progressing our immunology

1235
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,680
We know how T cells are produced, we know that

1236
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,580
Is there a way for us to use this knowledge to train

1237
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:24,020
This, the human immune system

1238
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,700
Generate T cells that fight cancer

1239
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,100
The biggest difficulty is that we don't know much about our enemies

1240
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,820
His cells are so similar to our cells

1241
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,840
Cancer cells, in the eyes of T cells

1242
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,600
It's almost the same as a normal cell

1243
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,380
his entire genetic makeup

1244
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,340
his protein

1245
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,140
almost very very similar to

1246
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,500
So basically we don't react to him.

1247
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:53,400
So we have to find a way to stimulate

1248
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,180
to cancer, especially to his tumor antigens

1249
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,660
professional reminder, save

1250
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,860
then this may be now

1251
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
May be applied to current immunization profiles

1252
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,220
That

1253
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,280
tumor microenvironment

1254
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,120
We now see such a large tumor

1255
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,480
a tumor

1256
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,220
In fact, there are not only IC packets in this tumor.

1257
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,920
it has a lot

1258
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,260
composition

1259
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,920
It's all about fighting the immune system

1260
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,160
so I call it

1261
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,560
it this

1262
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,720
Tumor microcircle is tumor micro environment

1263
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,920
It is actually built by the IC package

1264
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,920
A well-balanced defense bag

1265
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,920
who to defend

1266
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,920
defend your body's immune system

1267
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,420
like it has a chance of surviving

1268
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,320
That's swollen

1269
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:40,820
its mechanism

1270
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:41,920
This is a kind

1271
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,820
everyone can see

1272
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,320
These gray ones are IC bags

1273
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,720
There are many cells in there

1274
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,720
Blood vessel

1275
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,720
Because the IC package grows it needs blood vessels

1276
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,720
supply it with nutrients and oxygen

1277
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:54,920
Then you see there are many immune cells

1278
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,920
There are also T cells

1279
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,120
These antigen presenting cells, these

1280
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,120
The tumor micro environment just mentioned

1281
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
both

1282
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:02,860
a lot of

1283
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,860
So after you take that cancer out you give him a test

1284
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,820
Anyway, there are a lot of immune cells in it

1285
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,120
So that's weird. Is this immunity to attack cancer?

1286
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,520
so what

1287
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,320
he doesn't play his part

1288
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,280
It turns out that cancer just said that cancer should be able to

1289
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,860
try to survive it evolve some different mechanics

1290
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,260
It actually removes those cancer cells

1291
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,400
Uh, these immune cells are going to attack it

1292
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,840
But once it gets to the cancer cell, he trains it

1293
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,440
Turn it from an enemy who attacked it to a good friend

1294
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,840
So you look at these inside the tumor

1295
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,340
Immune Cells

1296
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,540
In fact, it becomes an immune suppressor cell.

1297
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,180
Its function is to suppress immune cells

1298
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,640
So it uses the hair of the son to attack the shield of the son

1299
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,740
It trains these immune cells, cancer cells to train these immune cells

1300
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,860
make it able to deal with

1301
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,460
Attack of the body's other immune cells

1302
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:03,460
very strong

1303
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,340
So these we call

1304
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:09,340
Inmute Suppressor Sales Immunosuppressive cells

1305
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,540
its essence is

1306
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:14,140
I just said that hematopoietic stem cells are trained

1307
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,020
These phagocytes

1308
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,140
But cancer cells have the ability to train it to

1309
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,140
immunosuppressive cells

1310
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,420
Then it uses a different mechanism

1311
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,500
I wonder if any of you are interested in this?

1312
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,420
Many different ABCDEFG

1313
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,820
various mechanisms

1314
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:28,580
to suppress it

1315
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
OK

1316
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
That

1317
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,560
So here I will use cartoon clothes to introduce

1318
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,520
This is antigenic laminarity

1319
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,000
I just said that the phagocytic cells look like this

1320
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,320
Then if you encounter this cancer cell

1321
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,520
it's the same it will eat it up

1322
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,120
Useless after devouring

1323
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,360
instead it becomes

1324
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,240
suppressor cells

1325
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,560
Suppressor Suppressor Antigenic Laminar Cells

1326
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,160
It presents to T cells

1327
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,160
T cells become wet energy

1328
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,460
Non-functioning air bag

1329
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,500
It's much different from just now

1330
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,140
After touching bacteria, it looks like this

1331
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,940
it becomes this

1332
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:13,820
very empty phagocytes

1333
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:15,480
this won't work

1334
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,360
Then this is an activated air bag, this is a non-functional air bag

1335
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,900
So there are different types of air bags

1336
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,600
White blood cells can disable your gas bag

1337
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,600
good

1338
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,500
Now we think, what we now call the rapid development of immunotherapy

1339
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:36,000
Is there a way we can make these defunct air bags

1340
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,800
restore its functionality

1341
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:44,200
A rejuvenated gas bag, if it can recognize cancer cells

1342
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,000
Is there a way to kill cancer cells

1343
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,900
So this is what we know recently

1344
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,400
Major advances in immunotherapy

1345
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,200
The answer, of course, is yes, at least for some patients.

1346
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,900
Then its practice is the past few years

1347
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,200
Some breakthroughs, and then introduce these methods

1348
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,800
It has some effect, that is, it uses active immunotherapy

1349
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:12,600
I just talked about the back-kinetic and active-kinetic, that is, your body produces these T cells

1350
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,500
But the T cells have been disabled and have no function, right?

1351
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:18,900
A simple solution is fine, if I know that this T cell is very important

1352
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:23,800
Then I am like T cells that get the name of the city management and cultivate a large number of them.

1353
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,700
Enter after training

1354
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,500
This we call T cell infusion therapy

1355
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,500
In this case, you can see that its function is to cut out the tumor

1356
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:39,000
These T cells inside, it will be cultivated in the future

1357
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:42,000
After being cultivated, it goes to the screening

1358
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,900
Those T cells that kill cancer cells

1359
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:51,200
These are added now, that is, the T cells can kill cancer cells

1360
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,300
Then it will be cultivated in large numbers in the future

1361
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,800
mass culture, of course it can be deactivated

1362
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,100
beat it into this ward

1363
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
This we call T cell infusion therapy

1364
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
It's a passive immunity

1365
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
very effective

1366
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
for certain cancers

1367
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Now this we call Tumor Influent Tritin Lymphocyte

1368
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Lymphocytes in tumors

1369
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
This Cartysil

1370
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
This is the T cell of Chimeric Antigen Receptor

1371
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
These are essentially T cells

1372
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It just makes it recognize different types of antigens

1373
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Cartysil is currently very red

1374
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
you see it for some cancers

1375
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Especially the treatment rate of hematologic lymphoma and blood cancer

1376
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
hundred percent

1377
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
But the past is hard to imagine

1378
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
but it needs to be

1379
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
every cancer patient

1380
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
To make its own Cartysil

1381
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So the fee will probably be considerable

1382
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
another big problem

1383
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
That is, how long will the effect last?

1384
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
This needs to be observed again

1385
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
But these patients were not

1386
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
other treatment opportunities

1387
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,460
Then use this T cell infusion therapy now

1388
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,600
can you

1389
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,800
Almost all cancer cells are under control

1390
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,800
So this is a really big breakthrough

1391
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,000
But what about this infusion therapy?

1392
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,400
with considerable side effects

1393
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,600
Some of them even caused the death of the patient

1394
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,000
Because imagine this T cell

1395
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,100
hit so many activated T cells

1396
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,100
Many found that it has similarities with normal cells

1397
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,400
also affects normal cells

1398
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:32,900
affect normal cells

1399
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,700
the inflammatory response

1400
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,700
serious death of the patient

1401
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,100
So any immune person who is effective

1402
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:44,100
In fact, it will be accompanied by different degrees of side effects

1403
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,100
immune-related side effects

1404
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,500
some autoimmune diseases

1405
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,000
so we have to learn

1406
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,600
How to control our immune system

1407
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,600
let it work to its advantage

1408
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,400
but avoid its disadvantages

1409
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,000
This is one of the future for this immunotherapy

1410
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,420
place to learn

1411
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,760
Then there's the other thing, the immune checkpoint elements.

1412
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:12,120
Then this hall award was founded in Taiwan

1413
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,360
exist

1414
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,200
At that time in 2014

1415
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,200
Awarded to these two winners

1416
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,200
One named James Ellison

1417
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,440
U.S.

1418
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,940
because it is called

1419
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:24,940
Motojuku

1420
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,940
in Japan

1421
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,560
Then they invented separately

1422
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,240
Discover

1423
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:31,240
Two different immune checkpoint molecules

1424
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,360
One is called CTLA4

1425
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,860
One is called PD1

1426
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,360
How does it work?

1427
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,860
I will tell you with cartoon pictures

1428
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,700
This T cell private T cell

1429
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:45,160
just said just said

1430
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,000
ICB has various

1431
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,320
immunotherapeutic

1432
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,560
one of them

1433
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,060
It's this immune checkpoint molecule.

1434
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,560
it makes this

1435
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,560
Well

1436
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,560
Performance such as this PDL1

1437
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,880
It will bind to the PD1 on the T cell

1438
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,600
After the combination, the TG package loses its function

1439
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,600
So it's called an immune checkpoint, and that's it.

1440
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,100
Will the TG package function

1441
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,100
It manifests itself on the immune will cells

1442
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:14,100
also manifested on the returning cells

1443
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:17,600
So it's easy, when you understand the principle

1444
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:23,000
I just thought, what if, with this combination, I will make the TG package lose its function

1445
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,600
I'll break its bond

1446
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,900
So they invented these two antibody drugs

1447
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
Inject antibody drugs into

1448
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:35,500
What about antibodies, bind to it

1449
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,500
unite with it, uh, separate it

1450
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
The TG package will no longer be affected by these two molecules at this time

1451
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,500
regulation of elicited immune volition

1452
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,000
Then this TG package didn't seem to work

1453
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,500
seems to restore its functionality

1454
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,000
Is there any chance to restore the function of TG package like this?

1455
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,800
to kill the patient's tumor

1456
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,000
as it is

1457
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Principle of action

1458
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,980
So the patient is injected with this antibody

1459
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,160
Look at this example, these two articles are in

1460
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:11,200
Published in well-known medical journals for 12 years

1461
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,320
The New England Journal

1462
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,200
introduce the story

1463
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:20,300
Let me give you a few examples. This is lung metastasis before treatment.

1464
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,660
Administration This is PD1

1465
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,960
this healing machine

1466
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,760
after 90 days

1467
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,800
This is liver metastases

1468
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,480
after 90 days

1469
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:35,840
And then here are the T cells in the tumor before treatment

1470
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:37,560
Black

1471
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,120
few

1472
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:42,680
after treatment you see

1473
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:45,420
Breath puts a lot of increase

1474
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,100
may restore it to function

1475
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,520
this is

1476
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,820
this is skin

1477
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,420
menanoma, melanoma

1478
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,140
Before treatment

1479
01:14:59,060 --> 01:14:59,960
the tumor

1480
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
After treatment

1481
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,920
Then I saw the large number of T cells

1482
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,940
So it looks like the effective treatment seems to be that the T cells

1483
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,500
It restores the function of T cells after treatment

1484
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,980
Then compare it with chemotherapy

1485
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,720
This is an antibody for NTPD1, ​​of course this is

1486
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,960
This is a relatively short experiment, probably more than a year

1487
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,340
to this melanin flow

1488
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:29,080
The over-2 survival rate of this antibody

1489
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,040
to about 16 months

1490
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:34,720
yes win this chemistry this chemotherapy

1491
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,920
but more then

1492
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,300
this kind of

1493
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,680
Immunological check check acceptor molecule

1494
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,900
Not just effective against one type of cancer

1495
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,360
It has different effects on lung cancer melanoma

1496
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,280
Kidney cancer Stomach cancer Head kidney cancer

1497
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,640
have varying degrees of effect, for example, on lung cancer

1498
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,540
This study is 23%

1499
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,320
23% of patients

1500
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,080
Responsive

1501
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
The best is black is 5% to 30%

1502
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The other about 10%

1503
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Don't forget that these are patients with no means of treatment in the past

1504
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So now we can achieve a success rate that is almost close to 20%

1505
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Using such an immune test for small molecules

1506
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
What he is most concerned about is how long his curative effect can last.

1507
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
If he only lives two years, it doesn't seem like enough.

1508
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
you want to heal him

1509
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
is there any chance

1510
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Then this clinical trial

1511
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
this is not a clinical trial

1512
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
This is because the CTOA4 immune test was detected earlier

1513
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
So he's been a patient long enough now

1514
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
end up over 10 years

1515
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Then recently they reorganized and published the results

1516
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
wait a minute

1517
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
This is the more than 1000 people

1518
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Nearly 2,000 of these patients

1519
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
how to read it here

1520
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
This is over 25

1521
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
his survival rate

1522
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
That is, if you die, he will decrease

1523
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Then this is the time, from the beginning, all the patients are alive

1524
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And then at one year, at 12 months, about half of the patients are still alive

1525
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Then these are the transferred melanin materials, which were almost difficult to treat in the past

1526
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:27,000
In two years, there will be a little more than 20% left

1527
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
There are probably more than 2 out of 10 people who can survive

1528
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
But you only need to survive for two years, with this medicine for two years, it seems that it will be fine

1529
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
it just keeps dying without these

1530
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Look at it for three years, four years, five years until ten years

1531
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
but maintain this cove

1532
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So this group of patients, the lucky ones, seems to be cured

1533
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
So I just spoke, as if cured, over ten years

1534
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,300
will really take longer

1535
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,400
Can be verified but should be very organic

1536
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:05,600
even if not cured

1537
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,100
Possibly, he's also been held in check by the immune system for a long time.

1538
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,200
So at least this is a very

1539
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,100
In the field of cancer treatment is a

1540
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,200
almost unheard of

1541
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,900
A cancer patient can live for such a long time

1542
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,000
so many patients

1543
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,400
If it is 1861 bit 20%

1544
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,100
that is there

1545
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:28,600
More than 300 fast 400 people

1546
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,300
But it's a pretty impressive number

1547
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,800
If many patients

1548
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,700
Other cancer patients have the same effect

1549
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:38,000
that is a very generous

1550
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,700
that looks now

1551
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,800
The effect of PD1

1552
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,000
better than this CDLF

1553
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,000
So it has the potential to be better curative

1554
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,600
Is that true for other types of cancer?

1555
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,000
It also has such a good effect

1556
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:50,700
depends on

1557
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,400
After that tracked treatment

1558
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:57,000
then this is me

1559
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,800
Ask the student to sort it out

1560
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:06,400
These drugs are available in Taiwan

1561
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,300
This PD1 monoclonal antibody

1562
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,400
Pembro Zilume

1563
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:16,100
This is another PD1 antibody

1564
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,800
This is the CT2F4 antibody

1565
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,200
different name

1566
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,400
This word is per kilogram

1567
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,000
two fate monsters

1568
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,100
It is about 50 100 for a patient weighing 50 kg

1569
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,700
once every three weeks

1570
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,300
260,000 once

1571
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,600
so the price is very good

1572
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,600
if you play for a year

1573
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,900
4000000

1574
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,600
then this drug

1575
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,600
Because it hits more frequently than

1576
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,300
see 900

1577
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,600
In this case, the most frequent frequency may be 300

1578
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,600
So it's expensive anyway

1579
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,100
And then only about 20%

1580
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:58,200
efficient

1581
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,100
may also be responsible

1582
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,600
But you look like you might be called Q

1583
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,200
It's not the same as in the past. In the past, you might extend

1584
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:12,200
This may be called the global

1585
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,200
So there is a big problem here

1586
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:19,200
How about us because it costs a lot and needs to be traded to varying degrees

1587
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,200
This side effect, is there a way to screen out these potentially effective

1588
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,200
20% of the patients, then I just treat those patients

1589
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,200
The other 8% doesn't work anyway, so don't waste the money

1590
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,400
So this is currently a very important research figure called BioMark

1591
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:36,400
Biomarker How to find patients who may be effective

1592
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:40,400
And then treat these patients, wait a minute, I just had a breakthrough last month.

1593
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,400
So I'm going to make that slide again today

1594
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,400
And now, several challenges, expensive

1595
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:52,400
Too expensive but help

1596
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,400
And the second one, there are only a few patients left because 20% is not bad

1597
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,600
The price is very low, yes

1598
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,160
5 people only one

1599
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:08,520
But for him, his 20% is very useful

1600
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:14,280
We have a way to develop more effective

1601
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,280
From 20% and up

1602
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:22,560
The third is that it is inevitable that

1603
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,040
With immune-related side effects

1604
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,680
serious will be serious

1605
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:32,640
In this regard, further research and development

1606
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:37,680
Next, I will tell him some of the decisions about immunotherapy.

1607
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,280
You just saw that example

1608
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:44,960
patients with colorectal cancer receiving traditional treatment

1609
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,280
If he has T cells

1610
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,960
Colorectal cancer is more likely to be better

1611
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:53,280
In fact, it was found that the immune

1612
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,640
Why in 20% of patients

1613
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,800
who works and who doesn't

1614
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,840
You see, this is a patient who doesn't respond to treatment.

1615
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,860
Before treatment After treatment This is his tumor

1616
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:09,860
This is to see that CDS is a kind of T cell

1617
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,980
you can't see the black one

1618
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:15,220
A little bit here, only a little bit after treatment

1619
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:18,820
So this patient is nothing small

1620
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:22,220
But look at the patient who was treated effectively

1621
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:25,980
Some T cells were already present before treatment

1622
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,100
more after treatment

1623
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,140
Then the tumor was under his control

1624
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:33,980
So they found that for the same reason

1625
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,740
If the patient

1626
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:38,460
He already had these T cells in

1627
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,860
It's just that he lost the function of T cells called wet energy.

1628
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,060
I didn't just say that

1629
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,980
put that brake on

1630
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:46,140
Get rid of the reason that made him burn into wet energy

1631
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,980
The T cells are reactivated

1632
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,900
But if you don't have this kind of T cells

1633
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:51,780
Then you don't suck

1634
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:52,820
It's useless for you to take medicine now

1635
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:55,380
you don't have

1636
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,180
so it's going to be a challenge

1637
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:00,180
how to make this patient

1638
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,760
The original non-existing system package to fight cancer

1639
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:05,000
In this way, more patients can be benefited

1640
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
The other 80% of patients

1641
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
This is the direction of future research and development

1642
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Oh, that's what I just said

1643
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
It was a report that came out last month.

1644
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
This report is actually quite an astonishing one.

1645
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
What I just talked about is melanin flow

1646
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Melanin flow is not so much in Taiwan

1647
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Our concern is lung cancer

1648
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
liver cancer

1649
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
colorectal cancer deer cancer

1650
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
These are the most common

1651
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Are these effective against these common cancers?

1652
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Well, they are the findings of this study

1653
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
There is something we call tumor heart anticancer

1654
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Called Neoantigen

1655
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
just mentioned

1656
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Cancer cells are different from normal cells

1657
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
because it keeps mutating

1658
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Mutations are the guarantee of its survival

1659
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
It was born because of a mutation so it was able to

1660
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,280
Blaming itself for survival, so it keeps accumulating these different mutations

1661
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:07,760
What about some of these mutations, which can cause tumor heart antigen

1662
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,800
Then they found that some cancers

1663
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,880
Because of gene repair, our body cells have a repair function

1664
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,860
Then when you mutate, we'll have some

1665
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:20,480
Some efficiencies will fix it back

1666
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,940
But some cancer cells have lost this correction function

1667
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:27,800
This is a tumor where the body's genetic repair is defective

1668
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,820
because it cannot correct these mutations

1669
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:33,420
So of course it will accumulate more mutations

1670
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:36,700
tumor heart antigen

1671
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,360
That antigen is what produces T cells

1672
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,840
necessary molecule

1673
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,880
So the researcher thinks that if the tumor

1674
01:24:47,020 --> 01:24:49,400
have more antigens

1675
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,560
more of this

1676
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,560
Newtation

1677
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,680
So, will this become easier for

1678
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:58,440
You've got to work too, that's their hypothesis

1679
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,240
So they are screening

1680
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,100
inside the tumor

1681
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,340
Tumors with defects in gene repair

1682
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,720
only treat this patient

1683
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,100
see if it responds better

1684
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:12,040
At this time it is not only doing

1685
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:15,000
Just now that melanoma it did across

1686
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,340
12 different types of cancer

1687
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,720
86 patients with genetic autumn blood

1688
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,720
The number of patients is not that many 86 patients

1689
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:25,500
This includes the most common

1690
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,060
colorectal cancer

1691
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,640
This is pancreatic cancer

1692
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,200
this

1693
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,800
There is still hope, there is no lung cancer here

1694
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,160
this is stomach cancer

1695
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,200
12 Different Gene Repair Defective Cancers

1696
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:42,620
treatment effect

1697
01:25:43,620 --> 01:25:44,620
this is

1698
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,720
belly hundred is

1699
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:50,020
Eliminate all. It originally treats those that are not eliminated as zero.

1700
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:51,700
The tumor turned out to be five centimeters

1701
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,700
You are still five centimeters after treatment, that is to maintain the same

1702
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,020
it doesn't last long

1703
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,420
But if it becomes zero

1704
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,940
If there is nothing, then this one is over here

1705
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,600
This is negative 100, all disappeared

1706
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,600
From here, patients like these are

1707
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,800
Not only is it useless after treatment, but he continues to grow

1708
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:14,840
But as you can see, useful patients

1709
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,720
It has reached 50%

1710
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,800
From just a few dozen, now to 50%

1711
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,160
The only thing he did was to sift through those

1712
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:28,240
Tumors with gene repair tangents

1713
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,800
That will significantly increase his healing effect.

1714
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,800
The longest of these has been almost three years

1715
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,560
So tell us here, one of the

1716
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,080
effective against immune persons, that is

1717
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:49,400
This tumor, it has many genetic mutations

1718
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,800
Mutations in this gene create new antigens

1719
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,360
new antigen

1720
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:56,600
May stimulate more somatic cells

1721
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,920
worked for him, so their study actually found

1722
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,500
After treatment, these systemic cells that are specialized for tumor heart antigens were found to increase

1723
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:08,300
This tells the story

1724
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,100
Tumors are most afraid of systemic cells

1725
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:14,900
Tumors with more genetic mutations

1726
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,200
Although it can apply this immune system attack

1727
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,200
but

1728
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,100
It is also more susceptible to systemic attack

1729
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,300
Now if say

1730
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,000
Clinicians

1731
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,000
That's actually been approved

1732
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,600
This is a treatment with a rare

1733
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,100
that is

1734
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,300
It has been approved that is to say as long as

1735
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,600
patients with metastatic cancer

1736
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:38,700
patients with gene repair tangents

1737
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,800
can be treated with this drug

1738
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,300
Then Taiwan should not have entered yet.

1739
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,100
But I reckon this should be fast

1740
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,300
will be approved in Taiwan

1741
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,300
that's right

1742
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,500
Many patients with metastatic cancer are of course a great boon.

1743
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:56,100
If you have cancer, it happens to be the tangent of this kind of gene repair

1744
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:56,900
then just

1745
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,700
for this immunotherapy

1746
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,500
The success rate will be significantly improved

1747
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:07,840
Then this is some basic research that can help some clinical progress

1748
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,600
next last little time

1749
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:12,100
now let's do

1750
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,600
that just said this

1751
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,700
whether gene repair defect

1752
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:20,200
You actually rely on the T cells that your patient originally had.

1753
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,800
If the patient has no T cells

1754
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Then you fight these current immune will machines

1755
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,400
it's useless

1756
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,800
but we said

1757
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,900
that triggers a T cell response

1758
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,000
We actually have a lot of experience in the past

1759
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,600
Ability we know how to elicit a good T cell response

1760
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,700
phagocytic activated phagocytes

1761
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,800
to present antigen

1762
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,400
costimulatory molecule

1763
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,800
Cytokines

1764
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,900
Like this one triggers a nice T cell response

1765
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,800
So we are simulating

1766
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,200
works like this

1767
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,600
So we use the method of doing

1768
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,600
radioimmunotherapy

1769
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,600
go find this cancer

1770
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,600
destroy it

1771
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,600
Didn't I just say that there are many cotton liquid lipid cells in it?

1772
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,600
I can't kill tumor cells

1773
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,600
Also kills cotton lipocytes

1774
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,600
break down his entire fortress

1775
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,600
At this time, the cancer cells released

1776
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,600
He will also release this tumor antigen

1777
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,600
What about after his whole antigen is released?

1778
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:27,600
Then you use immune drugs to deactivate the cells

1779
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:31,200
Finally hope that these T cells

1780
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,200
It can not only treat the cancer of the original stomach

1781
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,200
And he can use what he just said

1782
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
the lymphatic system blood circulatory system

1783
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:40,200
to find those who hide somewhere

1784
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
not yet visible to the naked eye

1785
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,200
I can't see that CT yet.

1786
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,200
metastatic cancer

1787
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,200
control it

1788
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,200
or make peace with it

1789
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,200
or just kill it

1790
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,200
This is the principle of the whole treatment

1791
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,800
we designed the animal model

1792
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Make a big factory to come to the cell

1793
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
day zero fight

1794
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,500
To simulate a large factory to dry transfer

1795
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,500
we hit it to this leather stick

1796
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,500
it will transfer to dry

1797
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:11,500
wait till it grows

1798
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,000
about 14 days later

1799
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,500
This original position has been hit

1800
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,500
more than 1 cm

1801
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,500
Metastatic cancer at this time

1802
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:21,500
eyes can't see yet

1803
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,500
But in a microscope like you can see

1804
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,000
this

1805
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,500
here

1806
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:29,500
here are all these

1807
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,500
we treat

1808
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,000
Only treat the cancer in situ

1809
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
we only treat this

1810
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
14 days old swollen face in situ

1811
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Let's pretend we don't see the metastatic cancer

1812
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
The main purpose is to

1813
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,500
Is there a way we can treat this

1814
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,500
carcinoma in situ

1815
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:47,000
Simultaneous immune response

1816
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,500
Of course the immune cells

1817
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,500
attack the cancer cells that have metastasized

1818
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,500
This is what we designed first

1819
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:54,500
Let's design a few groups

1820
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,000
a group does not treat it

1821
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
when compared

1822
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,500
One group only received radiation therapy

1823
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
One group only received immunotherapy and cell-based therapy

1824
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
The other group is radiation plus immunotherapy.

1825
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Its principle is to hope to generate new system cells

1826
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:18,000
This is a control for carcinoma in situ

1827
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
This one does not treat it from day 1 we start treatment on day 14

1828
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,000
At this time, it is about 100 to 200 cubic meters.

1829
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Then when it is not treated, it continues to grow, and it grows here in 20 days

1830
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Any bigger and we'll kill

1831
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
This is cellular immunotherapy itself, radiation therapy

1832
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Radiation therapy alone, or immunotherapy alone, doesn't work very well.

1833
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It can delay its growth but still long

1834
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
But if you combine these two treatments, the flow will disappear as soon as you see it

1835
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And not only for this transfer, but also for the transfer in the liver

1836
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
this is no treatment

1837
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
this is radiation therapy

1838
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
this is immunotherapy

1839
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Although immunotherapy seems to be less effective than radiotherapy for the original taste

1840
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
But it is better for cancer treatment and effect

1841
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Most notably, this combined treatment

1842
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
another pattern

1843
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Then after you treat this is no treatment

1844
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Radiation therapy is to look at the T cells

1845
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,000
T cells in the tumor

1846
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
You can see more about this seventy-eighty-seventy treatment

1847
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Combination therapy

1848
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
secret numb

1849
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
T cell responses following treatment

1850
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Another model is the spontaneous breast cancer model

1851
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Those modes just now used the job transfer mode

1852
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
you inject cancer cells into

1853
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Then this is to let the mice produce cancer cells by themselves

1854
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
a bit closer to human

1855
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
That's breast cancer

1856
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,160
In this model, there are fifteen pairs of mice in Lu County, and ten

1857
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,620
That is in Lu County, so there are only ten in this place

1858
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:09,600
Then he will transfer to waste

1859
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,400
About four months will be transferred to waste

1860
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,820
Then this is related to waste

1861
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,380
There are still a lot of finalists, ranking second in the world

1862
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:23,100
Then Taiwan is the fourth place, so this is no treatment

1863
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:28,100
Radiation plus immunotherapy, this PDL1 antibody

1864
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,400
Immunotherapy is not the only one

1865
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:35,700
In our development rate of more than one hundred years, a very wide variety of immunotherapies have been developed

1866
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,200
Antibodies against PDL1 are one type of immunotherapy

1867
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:44,700
Then our laboratory uses this cytokine immunotherapy

1868
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:48,800
Then this laboratory compares these two immunotherapies

1869
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
Effects of Concomitant Radiation Therapy

1870
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:56,200
Just relying on immunotherapy, in the Jiangdong mode, there is no obvious effect

1871
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,600
But then combining those two treatments, it's pretty obvious

1872
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,020
The metastases to the lungs are also seen to be very obvious

1873
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:05,020
The white ones are metastatic cells

1874
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:12,100
Of course, these are still in animal experiment mode.

1875
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:16,100
We also recently communicated with National Taiwan University Animal Hospital

1876
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:22,600
Animals, dogs, cats, older, get cancer like that

1877
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:27,200
It also treats radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery

1878
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:31,300
So the doctors at National Taiwan University Animal Hospital have been in contact with these patients

1879
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:39,300
We now hope that from small animals to a spontaneous pet cancer

1880
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,300
get closer to humans

1881
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:47,300
Then, using this combination of radiation and immunization

1882
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,300
This is our first therapy dog

1883
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:54,300
Received this radiation therapy at Taipei Medical University

1884
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,400
Then we'll give it immunotherapy

1885
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,400
Then I took it to the National Taiwan University Animal Hospital for observation.

1886
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,600
Finally, this history will make a summary

1887
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:12,600
It is hoped that immunotherapy will be combined with precise treatment

1888
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:16,900
or can eradicate cancer

1889
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,900
or you can coexist peacefully

1890
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:21,700
long-term peaceful coexistence

1891
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:23,100
this is also a cure

1892
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:28,300
Then I think I will introduce you to this side today

1893
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:31,100
Then use half an hour

1894
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:34,200
Welcome to ask questions

1895
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:44,700
Well, we thank Teacher Cao Mihua for a very wonderful speech

1896
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,400
let's open first

1897
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,300
please ask us

1898
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:54,300
Before I do that, let me announce

1899
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:57,200
we have prepared scientific magazine

1900
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:58,300
event book

1901
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,700
So I encourage you to ask questions

1902
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,100
so we

1903
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
The first ten of us who asked the question

1904
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,220
We'll have someone give one to a Science Man magazine

1905
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,720
good

1906
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,220
Levi

1907
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:09,720
ask the professor

1908
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,720
just mentioned that

1909
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,220
that immune system

1910
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,220
And that T cell

1911
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:19,420
That good effect on our body

1912
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:21,420
then i was thinking

1913
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:23,420
Prevention is better than cure

1914
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:28,520
Then ask the professor how to live

1915
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,860
how to take care of your body

1916
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:33,860
T cells can be stored in the body

1917
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:37,860
and have a good immune system

1918
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:38,860
Thanks

1919
01:36:38,860 --> 01:36:40,860
T cells have always been there

1920
01:36:40,860 --> 01:36:43,860
how to make it more

1921
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,860
In fact, this question is actually

1922
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:48,860
What level do you want to answer

1923
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:51,860
In fact, it is the traditional way that doctors tell you

1924
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,860
Mom and Dad tell you about this healthy lifestyle

1925
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:56,860
really say that

1926
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,860
Because Icene actually

1927
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:00,860
she doesn't look like

1928
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,520
Our general concept of vaccines is that you have a very clear enemy

1929
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,520
e.g. hepatitis B virus

1930
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,020
you know what its antigen is

1931
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:09,020
Then I will use this antigen in advance

1932
01:37:09,020 --> 01:37:13,020
to elicit an immune response

1933
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,020
But cancer didn't happen before

1934
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:18,020
you don't even know where

1935
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:20,020
even with cancer

1936
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:23,020
The location of its mutation is also different

1937
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:24,020
everyone may not know

1938
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,020
also breast cancer

1939
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:28,020
But it has a neoantigen

1940
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:29,040
Because there are antigens

1941
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,040
Now think every patient may be different

1942
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,040
So it's not like there's a cancer vaccine

1943
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,040
Everyone will basically not

1944
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:40,040
Rather, it may be that this precision

1945
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:42,040
for this patient

1946
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,040
We need to find its tumor antigen

1947
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,040
and then target this tumor antigen

1948
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:52,040
to create this effective immune response

1949
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,040
Fortunately we are now

1950
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:57,040
This software called Generational Genome Analysis

1951
01:37:57,060 --> 01:37:59,060
very progress

1952
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:00,060
so estimate

1953
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,460
Future cancer patients their cancer cells

1954
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,400
do this again

1955
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,860
sequencing of sequences

1956
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:08,640
Yes, the price can be very high

1957
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:09,760
competitive

1958
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,100
I don't know how expensive it is

1959
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,800
But it should get cheaper

1960
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,540
Then it's possible to find

1961
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:16,640
this patient

1962
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,640
The position of his mutation gene mutation

1963
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,440
Then design according to this

1964
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,440
The best immunotherapy for this patient

1965
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,040
As for how to go

1966
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,760
to take care of cancer patients

1967
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:29,600
that your good immunity

1968
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,160
maintain a healthy life

1969
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,760
Early to bed, early to rise, no drinking, no smoking

1970
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:36,460
these sports

1971
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:39,400
these are very basic

1972
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,760
take care of some of the health

1973
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,100
deliberate act

1974
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:45,200
So as long as there is

1975
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,700
enough that

1976
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:49,160
Somatic cells and the good immune system

1977
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,100
then

1978
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:53,360
It should definitely not be Nia.

1979
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,160
no

1980
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,660
I just said that

1981
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,400
That cancer cell is actually

1982
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,000
have always existed

1983
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Then you T cells to kill him

1984
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Of course it will happen

1985
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,000
no way

1986
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
no way

1987
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Because we have been exposed to these natural things

1988
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Then our cells are in the process of replicating

1989
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Our cells are always growing

1990
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
The growing process always goes wrong

1991
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
So there will always be errors in the process of copying

1992
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Although the number is low, it adds up to a lot

1993
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
So there's almost no way you can say you're replicating cells

1994
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
assuming it's 100 percent correct

1995
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
there would be no cancer so to speak

1996
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
But that is to say, there is no such thing as 100%

1997
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
That is to say, our copy is in the process

1998
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
some mutations will occur

1999
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
not so accurate

2000
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
where some mutations occur

2001
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
components of cancer cells

2002
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
then some of us will attack him

2003
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
But cancer cells have been evolving, evolving, evolving

2004
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
In the end he is not afraid of you

2005
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So I just talked about cancer

2006
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
The Four Survival Theory is just that

2007
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
So you can't say you have normal public opinion

2008
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
you won't have cancer cells

2009
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Because now cancer cells probably

2010
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Cancer counts in about five people

2011
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
There's probably one of four or five people inside

2012
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,120
So he's great

2013
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,600
The enemies you have to deal with are powerful

2014
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,960
there is one over there

2015
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:08,760
right

2016
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:09,400
please

2017
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,400
teacher ask

2018
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,800
Just now the teacher talked about the base part

2019
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,520
Does that mean people with immune diseases

2020
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,560
less likely to get cancer

2021
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:20,860
Let's say you have erythroid cystic bowel

2022
01:40:20,860 --> 01:40:22,320
less likely to get breast cancer

2023
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:24,660
This is a question with two sides

2024
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:27,060
I think your question is like a scientist

2025
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:27,400
right

2026
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,560
You don't know what you're doing

2027
01:40:28,660 --> 01:40:29,780
Actually because

2028
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,660
cancer

2029
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:33,360
I'm really not sure

2030
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,960
Have read the literature on this

2031
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,380
But I'm doing hepatitis virus myself

2032
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:39,080
he really did report

2033
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,880
some immune patients

2034
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,680
Hepatitis Virus

2035
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,020
In fact, body immunity

2036
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:48,960
He's more of an overactive immune system

2037
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:49,380
then it looks like

2038
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,420
for some infectious diseases

2039
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:52,560
that's right

2040
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,560
chronic infectious disease

2041
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,580
that's right

2042
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:57,020
So I think it's possible

2043
01:40:57,020 --> 01:40:57,720
but i'm not sure

2044
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:59,020
has anyone done it

2045
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:00,080
one like this

2046
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,760
A large-scale statistical analysis

2047
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,260
I think this is in public health

2048
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:06,860
This is a possible research topic

2049
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:08,260
font immune patient

2050
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:09,760
is it his cancer

2051
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,360
or certain cancers

2052
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,360
The attack rate will be lower

2053
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,360
I think it is theoretically possible

2054
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,660
I just had two questions over there.

2055
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:19,860
Did it just come here?

2056
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:21,860
OK, so is it?

2057
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:23,160
thank you

2058
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,660
one thing yes please

2059
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Interesting Topics for Chinese Speech

2060
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
What I want to ask is that it is mentioned that

2061
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
is the total number of T cells

2062
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
affect the effectiveness of the entire treatment

2063
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
The total number of T cells

2064
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
different types of T cells

2065
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Or it is said that it is Satutoxic T cell

2066
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Or Suppressor T cell

2067
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Regulatory T cell

2068
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Is there any Specific T cell?

2069
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
or total

2070
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
ok then back to this

2071
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I may have just misdefined

2072
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,780
T cell hormone is the T cell hormone in the seed stream

2073
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:05,380
in the blood that doesn't count

2074
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:08,400
In the blood, don't you only deal with the blood?

2075
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,200
You still have to deal with these dimensional creatures, these creatures

2076
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:12,780
So our body's T cells are not just to deal with the flow

2077
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:14,460
Then the T cell hormones we are talking about are

2078
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,680
T cell seed

2079
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,020
Because this T cell will go to the seed stream

2080
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:19,680
It is probably the flow of knowledge

2081
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,200
So what kind of T cells are more effective?

2082
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,120
Because T cells have a type called

2083
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,160
You just mentioned that they are heterozygous T cells

2084
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:30,480
Regulate T cells this is bad

2085
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,680
So there is Correlation

2086
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,600
If we say that there are many different types of T cells

2087
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:36,400
In fact, the prognosis for it is relatively bad.

2088
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:39,720
Icva is afraid of Cd8 T cells

2089
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:45,320
So it should be more and more Cd8T cells

2090
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,280
its prognosis

2091
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:50,200
Overall prognosis will be better

2092
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:52,360
that gentleman

2093
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:57,600
professor please

2094
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:00,000
That's because there is a Dr. Zhuang

2095
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,440
The last issue was to coexist with cancer

2096
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,960
It's after the invention of that towel fuck

2097
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:15,360
Use that energy to be in touch with the heavens and the earth to coexist with cancer

2098
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,880
That is to say

2099
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:21,280
Will its activity just increase that kind of

2100
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:23,680
increased immune system

2101
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,760
In this case, if we promote everyone to exercise

2102
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:31,440
It is less likely to say that cancer arises

2103
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,440
Do you have any research on this?

2104
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,280
Ladies and gentlemen, I can only talk about a healthy lifestyle.

2105
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,840
What you said just now should actually be a kind of exercise.

2106
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,960
When you exercise as a whole, it is more important to your overall physical condition

2107
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,480
The whole of this includes the immune system

2108
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,480
It should be healthier

2109
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:56,480
But is it because of this that you don't get cancer?

2110
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,000
This is difficult to go, it should be in nature

2111
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,600
In science, no correlation like this has been studied

2112
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:08,800
Some people you can see some people you can see in the packing yard

2113
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:13,700
Life is very healthy now, long-distance running, triathlon, non-smoking

2114
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,000
This is the proof

2115
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,000
So that is to say, because IC8 appeared in the evolution process

2116
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Sometimes your physical condition does not mean that you are immune

2117
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,500
So this part is hard to talk about

2118
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:32,100
But, overall, as long as you maintain a healthy lifestyle

2119
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,300
must be helpful

2120
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:36,300
For example, some cancer-causing factors are known, such as obesity

2121
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:41,000
This inflammatory response, these are all bad

2122
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,400
this is a danger signal

2123
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:47,500
So if you say that the factors that can reduce the risk of these cancers

2124
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:51,300
Then your overall VL ratio will drop, this is known

2125
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:54,800
For example, like our carriers of hepatitis B virus

2126
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,300
If you can take medicine to control the number of hepatitis B virus

2127
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:00,300
that will reduce

2128
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
At least you get liver cancer rates

2129
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,000
know this

2130
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,000
there are two over there i think

2131
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Mr. Levi that

2132
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Hello Professor

2133
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
The question I want to ask is to say

2134
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,000
It was mentioned just now, in fact, it was mentioned at the beginning

2135
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
our immune system

2136
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
In fact, there are many different types of immune cells

2137
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Contains GCC cells B cells and T cells

2138
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Today's is what the professor just mentioned

2139
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
The main part of immunotherapy

2140
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
The feeling is to focus on the part of T cells

2141
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Then in immunotherapy

2142
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Does it target B cells

2143
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Or related functions of GCC cells

2144
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
other research done

2145
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Thanks

2146
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
That is, the immune system, in addition to T cells

2147
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Are other cells

2148
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
T cells do not activate themselves

2149
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
right

2150
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
It requires antigen presenting cells

2151
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
it will be alive

2152
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
so the immune system it's not

2153
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
can exist independently

2154
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
It's actually B cells that have a very tight

2155
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
regulatory relationship

2156
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
The function of B cells

2157
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Antibodies

2158
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Antibody

2159
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,000
We now especially synthetically affirm

2160
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,500
for microbial vaccines

2161
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,800
it plays a big part

2162
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,600
this microbe

2163
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:09,800
It would have been by invading the cells of the body

2164
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:11,200
into this cell

2165
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,800
Then achieve the purpose of infection

2166
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:14,700
Then if there are antibodies

2167
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:16,200
synthesize it

2168
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,100
That virus can't get in

2169
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,800
But the antibody has to go directly

2170
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,700
It also does not directly kill cancer cells

2171
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:24,900
What it does is probably

2172
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:28,000
It binds cancer cells by

2173
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
then deactivate

2174
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,800
For example, NK cells

2175
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:35,800
activate the phagocytic cells

2176
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,400
is possible by means of something like this

2177
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,500
to achieve the effect of cancer control

2178
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:43,000
But at least for now

2179
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,900
That is to say, in this whole cancer immunotherapy

2180
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:50,500
In the current experience like this

2181
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:53,000
The role of T cells

2182
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,300
cellular immunity

2183
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,800
more important role

2184
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,000
from animal experiments

2185
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,900
Follow the end of these cancer diseases in humans

2186
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,320
looks like this

2187
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:02,160
So now immunotherapy

2188
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,860
In fact, the general research focus is on

2189
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:06,760
How to strengthen the patient's

2190
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:08,700
professional system fort

2191
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:10,400
That must be my fault

2192
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,840
it's useless

2193
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,400
but relatively speaking

2194
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:17,400
Your role may be more prominent in the system

2195
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,900
that lady is in front

2196
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,600
right

2197
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,640
Hello, teacher

2198
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,500
I just heard more

2199
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,740
Related to immuno checkpoint

2200
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:28,500
For example, for CARTE

2201
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:29,640
technology like this

2202
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,360
Is it still in clinical trials

2203
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,440
or already in some countries

2204
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:34,640
can be used to execute

2205
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,340
already on sale

2206
01:47:36,340 --> 01:47:39,040
That Novatis

2207
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,040
should

2208
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,040
This is already listed

2209
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:43,800
This is the product that can be bought

2210
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:47,740
But something like this

2211
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:50,840
Every patient has to do its own CARTE sales

2212
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:53,140
So the second question I want to ask is to say

2213
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:57,240
So if we want to treat with CARTE

2214
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:59,240
how long will it take

2215
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:00,240
will be wrong

2216
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,600
enough T cells

2217
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,200
Is it possible that this T cell came from a

2218
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,400
extreme blood or other

2219
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,040
is used

2220
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:11,040
STEM cell and then go to Differentiate to enough T cell

2221
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:14,200
If you hit someone's body, you must still

2222
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:16,400
Should be difficult from STEM cell

2223
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,920
Because the STEM cell just mentioned is the one

2224
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,280
hematopoietic cells

2225
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,880
it differentiates a lot

2226
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:23,680
You want to divide it has a mature T cell

2227
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,080
It's not easy

2228
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:27,200
So usually the patient's own

2229
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,400
mature T cells

2230
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,680
remodel it

2231
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:33,280
But if I've found out that I have cancer

2232
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,520
Then I still have time to go

2233
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,520
Store enough T cells

2234
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,080
Do you want to do the next Carty?

2235
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,480
or i might

2236
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:41,600
for example

2237
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,320
How much is best to have every year

2238
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,080
enough stock

2239
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,160
Will be a Carty cell in the future

2240
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,080
there is no way to do it like

2241
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,880
usually i

2242
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:53,720
Because of Carty cell

2243
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:54,560
I didn't say it myself

2244
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,440
Because I am a mouse myself

2245
01:48:56,440 --> 01:48:57,640
so many are

2246
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,520
purple ice pop

2247
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,760
But you'll be exposed to information like this

2248
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,000
Cartysales me

2249
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,200
I

2250
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:10,400
I ran into a graduate student from our biomedical institute about a few weeks ago

2251
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,600
Then he is in this company now

2252
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,200
So called Cartysales

2253
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:16,500
Then I had a lot of ideas in the past

2254
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:20,600
I thought it was okay to ask this lady if it was done

2255
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:21,800
may take a long time

2256
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,300
But they are in that company now

2257
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:27,000
He told me about two to three weeks

2258
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:30,600
They can make this patient's Cartysales

2259
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,000
he's so handsome

2260
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,900
That is to say, it is actually very competitive.

2261
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:37,000
But there is still no way to solve the problem that is

2262
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:42,400
Every patient has to do his own Cartysales

2263
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,200
How to prepare this Cartysales

2264
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:47,300
how to deactivate

2265
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:50,200
Then how to save

2266
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,100
These will be some of the challenges in manufacturing

2267
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:55,000
then you can imagine

2268
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:59,900
His price will be higher than the one I just put on

2269
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,240
more, because after that drug was made

2270
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,240
Everyone can use it, every cancer patient can

2271
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:06,240
The first time you see it, only you can use it

2272
01:50:07,580 --> 01:50:10,080
There are four prices, I believe it will not be cheap

2273
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,580
so if i already have cancer

2274
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:15,580
can i still have time

2275
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:18,340
Now the most effective treatment is for blood cancer patients.

2276
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,740
If you get a blood cancer patient

2277
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:23,740
Especially a species called CD19

2278
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:26,440
related B cell blood cancer

2279
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:28,500
The cure rate is very high

2280
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:32,500
here, this bit, yes

2281
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,500
Then sit in the back seat over there

2282
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:35,500
come here first

2283
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,500
hello professor, thank you for your presentation

2284
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:46,500
I have two questions, the first one is

2285
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:49,500
According to T-cell receptor

2286
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,500
It is in Encode T-cell receptor

2287
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,500
Is to use VDGA recombination

2288
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,500
so fearadically the repertoire

2289
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,500
of the T-cell detection would be

2290
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:08,800
If you can detect different energies, there will be a lot of people playing

2291
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:24,540
Is there any related research to find out which T-cell in your body can contain Detect Cancer like Service Market

2292
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:31,300
The total rate of T-cell is very high, it is generated by this Recombination

2293
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:36,700
It recognizes a lot of antigens, so you just know its sequence is useless

2294
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:41,940
You know its Sequence, but you don’t actually know what this T-cell knows.

2295
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:46,140
So now it's the other way around, you first find its mutation

2296
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:48,640
Because T-cell recognition is these Mutation Antigen

2297
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:52,940
Then you use the so-called Neo Antigen of this Mutation

2298
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:59,340
Go see if you can stimulate the concept of T-cell, assuming that this Neo Antigen can stimulate the patient's T-cell

2299
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:15,000
It is resistance, copy, and then see the sequence of a certain group of system packages, T-cell receptor, it really increases, then you know that this T-cell should know this neo-antigen, but the other way around

2300
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Another question is that your laboratory has research on combination of therapies, first you use the radiation to induce destruction of determining microenvironment, and then followed by introduction of T-cells,

2301
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
You can talk to us on camera, I can't hear you

2302
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
OK, so this question is to say, as I just said,

2303
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
For example, tumors are afraid of T-cell

2304
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
It's good if there are T-cells in the tumor recently

2305
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Because yours may be more responsive

2306
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
So the problem just now is that my lab is doing

2307
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
radiation therapy first

2308
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
followed by immunotherapy

2309
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
After radiation therapy

2310
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
The T-cells in the tumor were killed

2311
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
that's right

2312
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
But where does the T-cell come from?

2313
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
come on those questions

2314
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Where is the T-cell confirmed?

2315
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
do not forget

2316
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:32,000
It's our body's immune system

2317
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
in the bone marrow

2318
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
bone marrow modeling blast

2319
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
It keeps making T-cell out

2320
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
only when there is a tumor

2321
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
As soon as your T-cell is attracted to the tumor

2322
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
It becomes an inhibitory T-cell

2323
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
it loses function

2324
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Then if we use radiation

2325
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
destroy it this tumor for the environment

2326
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
destroy its inhibiting environment

2327
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
break down its fortress

2328
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
In this way, you are in the newly generated T-cell

2329
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
it has a chance

2330
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
will generate a

2331
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,340
effective aggressive

2332
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:04,340
A functional system is packaged out

2333
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:05,340
It's all about our principles

2334
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:06,140
that is

2335
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:08,140
It's like breaking cancer into chains

2336
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:10,140
Use the square ray to knock it out first

2337
01:54:10,140 --> 01:54:12,140
After destroying its entire environment

2338
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:15,140
becomes an inflamed environment

2339
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:17,140
At this time it is beneficial

2340
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:18,140
immune response

2341
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:20,140
immune response triggered like bacteria

2342
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:21,640
Because if cancer is like bacteria

2343
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,640
to elicit such a strong immune response

2344
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,640
Then we probably won't be afraid of cancer

2345
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,640
It is mostly after cancer cells

2346
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:27,640
It's too much like we can system package

2347
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,640
less likely to produce a severe inflammation

2348
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,280
So you try it out on a T-shirt

2349
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,280
less functional

2350
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:33,280
But our T-shirt has always existed

2351
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:34,780
You know it takes care of your immune type

2352
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:36,780
The soundness of hematopoietic organs

2353
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:38,280
you will always provide these

2354
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,280
Normal T-Shirt comes out

2355
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:43,780
Mr. Mina

2356
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:45,780
Hello, Professor, I am Jianfu

2357
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:48,780
I'm glad you went deep into the future and talked about it in such detail.

2358
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:50,780
Molecular In-Depth Physician

2359
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:52,780
also our teacher

2360
01:54:52,780 --> 01:54:54,780
I think the professor just mentioned that

2361
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:56,780
Play that BDL at the beginning

2362
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:58,780
There is MuseoField going to eat bacteria

2363
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:01,420
but he

2364
01:55:01,420 --> 01:55:03,420
He will have MuseoField

2365
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:05,420
but he should be

2366
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,420
because he is doing cancer

2367
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:09,420
he has been providing

2368
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:11,420
MuseoField

2369
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:13,420
he has been providing

2370
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:15,420

2371
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:17,420
he has been providing

2372
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:19,420
MuseoField

2373
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,420
he has been providing

2374
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:23,420
MuseoField

2375
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:25,420
he has been providing

2376
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:27,420
MuseoField

2377
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:06,520
In the whole process, the structure of the RVC next to it also becomes Cancel sale

2378
01:55:06,520 --> 01:55:11,640
Even red blood cells that become polar cells start to change in shape

2379
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:15,560
It's in the process of chasing some of our MACO jurisprudence or some

2380
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:19,680
Will the lost fee release some H2O2 to chase

2381
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:23,480
Or an RVC change that caused its modulus

2382
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:28,600
Then after this change in the RVC of the polar cell it becomes like that

2383
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:32,560
Does the blood flow that helps us maintain our blood vessels become slower

2384
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:39,240
But some MACO jurisprudence has a chance to get where it wants to go

2385
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,760
Because the velocity can be slower

2386
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:44,120
Is that in turn a chance for us

2387
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:47,520
Like the teacher you just mentioned a good model

2388
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:51,120
It's after Redaction, which stimulates immunity to the storm

2389
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:55,280
make that place a structure

2390
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,120
Attract other new TC packs

2391
01:55:58,120 --> 01:56:00,040
Then we will evaluate it later

2392
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,100
Check whether the treatment or operating treatment is effective

2393
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:08,360
Do we have a chance to look at local nearby RBC cells

2394
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:11,020
Originally the plane of Guanghua's outer sphere

2395
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:15,940
It has become some acute cells or extremely strong protrusions

2396
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:19,360
Its proportions can also become a pathological one

2397
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:21,740
A reference to the early stages of an effective response

2398
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:22,660
Thanks

2399
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:24,100
Thank you for your careful observation

2400
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:25,140
In fact, I played this video for so long

2401
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:26,940
I never went to see that RBC

2402
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:31,580
Is there something you just said about the RBC shape change and so on

2403
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:33,660
I just said I really didn't pay attention

2404
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:38,420
Because this is from a published magazine

2405
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:41,280
to expose it

2406
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,360
the object of its study

2407
01:56:43,360 --> 01:56:45,980
It's what I just said, it sees bacteria

2408
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:49,540
See the neutral white blood cells in this city

2409
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:55,140
A lot of these optical things sometimes suffer a bit

2410
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:58,980
But I guess it whole research doesn't mention this RBC

2411
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:00,000
to know me

2412
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,120
What about RBC? I can't say it has no impact.

2413
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,500
Because many scientists are more conservative

2414
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:07,000
If you don't know, just say you don't know

2415
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
So RBC did not say that it is in immunotherapy

2416
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Now I know what kind of role to play

2417
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
currently no

2418
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
As for whether he will affect immunotherapy

2419
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
He can also know by being a medium

2420
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
The effect of immunotherapy

2421
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:22,000
There is no such related report either

2422
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Because basically the peritch compound H2O2

2423
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:30,000
After getting around by our MACOFARG or MUCOFIL

2424
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Maybe to our RBC's CELL MEMBER

2425
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
will cause a change in the structure

2426
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
so maybe it will be a reference

2427
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
That is to say, if like MUCOFIL, MACOFIL

2428
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,000
These phagocytes

2429
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
The principle of its activation is as you just mentioned

2430
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
perpruritics or some other

2431
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Like NL, this is called heterooxidized egg

2432
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:55,000
or other principles of these bactericidal phagocytes

2433
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
may cause damage to some organizations

2434
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,000
So where we are speaking

2435
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
In fact, some tissue damage will be seen

2436
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
need to fix later

2437
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
It was also mentioned that

2438
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
These are likely to

2439
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Cancer cells have a similar ability to attack

2440
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
But this role he plays is complicated

2441
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Because you just saw his immunotherapy cells

2442
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Many of these phagocytes

2443
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
He called this phagocyte

2444
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
cancer cells called him

2445
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
All his beliefs became his

2446
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
that

2447
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
defense force

2448
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
So he is helping the cancer cells

2449
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
It's more active now

2450
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Those inside those cancer cells

2451
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
phagocyte

2452
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
We no longer call him Phagocyte

2453
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
we are called

2454
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Immunotherapy

2455
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Most of his roles are to help cancer cells

2456
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
instead of killing cancer cells

2457
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
More evidence now

2458
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
But there are also special reports that say

2459
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
He also seems to have the ability to kill cancer cells

2460
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
thank you very much thank you

2461
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
in the middle

2462
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
right

2463
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
we usually say

2464
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
You shouldn't be sick if you eat all you can

2465
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
that is our immune cells

2466
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,600
The system is affected by some TRIGGER

2467
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:03,960
So the immune system is getting stronger

2468
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:06,860
That Uncertain this natural thing

2469
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:08,020
is it possible for him

2470
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:10,060
That is, we are all afraid of things that come from us.

2471
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:11,360
But is it possible for him

2472
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,420
On the contrary, it will strengthen

2473
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:15,460
our immune system

2474
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:18,620
under certain critical conditions

2475
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:20,600
Then there is another question, that is

2476
01:59:20,600 --> 01:59:21,900
It was mentioned at the beginning

2477
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:23,420
severe inflammatory reaction

2478
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:25,060
last cancer cell

2479
01:59:25,060 --> 01:59:26,620
Severe cancer cells are eliminated

2480
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:29,100
But now there is more and more evidence that

2481
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:31,660
Inflammation is linked to many cancers

2482
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:33,820
So this severe inflammation is

2483
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:36,500
On the contrary, it can miraculously cure cancer

2484
01:59:36,500 --> 01:59:37,860
that in chronic inflammation

2485
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,960
On the contrary, it is related to many cancers

2486
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:42,660
So what is the rationale for this?

2487
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:43,500
explain it

2488
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,660
basically two questions

2489
01:59:44,660 --> 01:59:47,260
One is what trains cancer

2490
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:48,260
Cancer is not liver or tendon

2491
01:59:48,260 --> 01:59:49,020
In fact, not liver or tendon

2492
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:51,060
Probably Vitality

2493
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:52,420
So in our physical environment

2494
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:53,820
training with what you eat

2495
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:56,900
Now there are a lot of beauties who have problems

2496
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,800
Bacteriology, that is, our human body

2497
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:06,000
It's not just human cells

2498
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,800
If you look at the skin, look at the gut

2499
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:13,300
There's a lot of bacteria, a lot of microbes

2500
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:15,800
that some research is now very clear

2501
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:18,300
It's you who put the mouse

2502
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:21,700
kept in a sterile environment

2503
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:24,000
keep it free of bacteria

2504
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:27,300
This mouse's immune system is unhealthy

2505
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,800
It was even found that

2506
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:34,800
Cancer in these bacteria-free mice

2507
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:38,300
Your immune system treatment is useless

2508
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:39,900
So bacteria to some extent

2509
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:42,800
Humans need symbiotic bacteria with humans

2510
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,100
This is called symbiotic bacteria

2511
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:48,600
It promotes the development of your immune system

2512
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:49,800
so this is there

2513
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:52,600
But Uncogean these chemical carcinogens

2514
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,800
Probably not the concept

2515
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:56,700
Chemical carcinogens are these chemicals

2516
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:58,400
Its main working principle

2517
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,900
It's what triggers you to mutate

2518
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,600
Increase the mutation rate, such as UV radiation, chemical substances

2519
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:10,000
The higher your mutation rate, the greater the chance of normal bubbles turning into bubbles

2520
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:21,500
So this has nothing to do with immunity, but it is the reason why Tumor generates the entire tumor bubble

2521
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:25,100
As for the second question, you can remind me again

2522
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:30,100
It's a severe inflammatory reaction.

2523
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:36,100
In fact, the inflammatory response is what we need, but chronic inflammation is not good

2524
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:46,100
Then you just watched that Coli, I was thinking why people in the future can’t copy it

2525
02:01:46,100 --> 02:01:52,100
Because there's no way we're going to allow a hospital to feel so inflammatory.

2526
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:58,100
Antibiotics knocked him out in the morning, because infection with inflammatory bacteria is serious

2527
02:01:58,100 --> 02:02:00,100
You were fast then, and...

2528
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
So immediacy is gone

2529
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Therefore, the current medical treatment cannot allow this kind of

2530
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
The presence of an immediate bacterial infection such as

2531
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
that in the past

2532
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:12,000
In Coly100s

2533
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
you have no choice

2534
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:14,000
no antibiotics at all

2535
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
so you don't go to therapy

2536
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
So some patients will get serious infections

2537
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
So like in a severe infection

2538
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
localized inflammation

2539
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Some patients may survive

2540
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
the cancer may be under control

2541
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
However, some patients may have bacterial infections

2542
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
cause fatal

2543
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
inflammatory reaction

2544
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Like chronic inflammation vs instant inflammation

2545
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
It's a different concept

2546
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
chronic inflammation such as obesity

2547
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
is a chronic inflammation

2548
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:43,000
rhinohepatitis virus infection

2549
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
It causes chronic inflammation of the liver

2550
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
chronic inflammation it will create this environment

2551
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Let the death of this cell

2552
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Increased replication rate

2553
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
In fact, it also increases its mutation rate

2554
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
increase the chance of cancer cells

2555
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
So this one might be heavier

2556
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Some are to help IC package generation

2557
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:06,000
But the activation of young cells requires an inflammatory environment

2558
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
This is certain

2559
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
it's almost time

2560
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
our last question

2561
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
The teacher asks a question

2562
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Will total flow T cells have something to do with genetics?

2563
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Let's say the parents already have cancer

2564
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Will the cultivation of his T cells be effective for his children?

2565
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
that is

2566
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Thanks

2567
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
T cells cannot interact with each other

2568
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I just said that T cells can only use your own

2569
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Why?

2570
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Because we humans probably know about organ rejection

2571
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
when you want to pass on your organs

2572
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
You have to match your tissue antigens first

2573
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Finding Rarely Becomes Finding Just Right

2574
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Otherwise there will be twins

2575
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
His tissue antigens are the same

2576
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,000
you can pass

2577
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,000
same concept

2578
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
That is to say, your T cells

2579
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
And who is that exclusion?

2580
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
It's the T cells that are rejecting

2581
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Because he went to meet a foreign

2582
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
something he doesn't know

2583
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
He repells you and kills you

2584
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,340
So if you want to do TCL

2585
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:06,340
unless your one

2586
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:08,340
of these tissue antigens

2587
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,340
ask you

2588
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:11,840
To give you TCL exactly the same

2589
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,340
That's probably only possible with soft twins.

2590
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:14,340
the parents

2591
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:16,340
Your mother can, but your parents'

2592
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:18,340
To you, you're half dad

2593
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:19,340
half mom, right?

2594
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:21,340
so you that

2595
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:23,340
parents too

2596
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:24,340
also not

2597
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:26,340
usually you just

2598
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:27,840
Use your own TCL

2599
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,840
to manufacture

2600
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,840
to be able to use it on oneself

2601
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,840
So when we talked about Cartysail just now

2602
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,840
Or something like TIL

2603
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,840
T cell infusion therapy

2604
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,840
from the patient's blood

2605
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,840
extract his T cells

2606
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:43,840
a lot of cultivation

2607
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:45,840
and inject it back into the patient

2608
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,840
That is, if

2609
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,840
The same soft twins have a chance

2610
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,840
Others have no chance, that's what it means

2611
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:55,840
should be if you say you want

2612
02:04:55,840 --> 02:04:57,840
must use other people's words

2613
02:04:57,840 --> 02:04:59,840
Now you can technically use your own TIL

2614
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,960
But I think technical development is theoretically not impossible

2615
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:06,260
Because you only need to say that the card you use is T cell

2616
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:11,260
Is it not showing these reasons

2617
02:05:11,260 --> 02:05:14,060
These organizations just mentioned seem theoretically possible

2618
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:16,260
So I know that there are also people who are working on the card T cell

2619
02:05:16,260 --> 02:05:19,460
Hope to make a universal T cell

2620
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:24,860
Only in this way can it be used more quickly in most patients

2621
02:05:24,860 --> 02:05:26,860
But these are still in the research stage

2622
02:05:27,620 --> 02:05:30,620
ok i now our time is up

2623
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:32,620
i know there are many questions

2624
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:37,120
So maybe that Mr. Tao would like to stay a few minutes longer

2625
02:05:37,120 --> 02:05:39,620
But I think we're officially here now

2626
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:40,620
that's where the speech ends

2627
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,960
I'll make one now

2628
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:44,920
Teachers are next month's knowledge prize banquet

2629
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:51,220
Is the director of Lin Ziyi's special evaluation researcher at the law firm

2630
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:56,820
The director of the law firm will conduct atomic and molecular research at the campus of National Taiwan University

2631
02:05:56,820 --> 02:05:59,280
Institute of Science Former Branch

2632
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:04,000
All are welcome on September 26th

2633
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
ok then thanks again

2634
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Professor Tao Minhua

2635
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
