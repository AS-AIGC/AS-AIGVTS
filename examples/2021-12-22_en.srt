00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
"Qiu Yuan's Old Words"

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Qiu Yuan's old words, hello, everyone

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The guards of our hospital commemorate the 130th birthday of Mr. Hu Shi, President Gu

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Specially hold a feast of knowledge this month

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The speakers invited by President Hu Shi for the popular science lectures are

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Winner of Hu Shi Memorial Research Lecture in 1909

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Qiu Zhonglin, a researcher at the Institute of History of our school

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Lecture for us on the history of hoarding and cutting money in Chinese history

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Researcher Qiu Zhonglin was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of History, National Taiwan University in 1997

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Said a teacher in the History Department of Danjiang University

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Since 2001, he has been working as a research officer in 11 institutes of our hospital

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
work so far

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,360
He was awarded the 2006

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,080
Research Writing Award for Young Scholars

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,920
Ministry of Science and Technology 2018

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,720
Outstanding Research Award

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,440
And last year with a festival ceremony to mobilize

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,040
A research project centered on the official village camp activities of the Youth League

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,920
Won the Hu Shih Memorial Research Award

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,560
Researcher Qiu has long been committed to the social and cultural history of the Minqing Youth League

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,760
and Material Culture Studies

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,400
Talking about the topic

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,920
Includes blue material drainage medical system

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,000
spending history

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,840
in Chinese history

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
Good at separating records, etc.

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,920
In the near future, it focuses on the military epidemic prevention system of the Ming Dynasty

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,800
and long-distance travel history

29
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,720
Today he will share with us

30
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
The record of collective segregation in the history of China

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,360
And examine the cultural explanations of the ancients for this phenomenon

32
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,240
Listen carefully to the wonderful and promising background content

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,440
Welcome to Researcher Qiu Zhonglin

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,640
Dean of Defense, Hello, audience.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,600
It is a great honor to be invited by the academy to give a lecture today

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,400
The topic I'm going to talk about has been reported by the chief of defense.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,560
I'll just start talking

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,200
Research on this topic actually collected materials very early

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,160
generally speaking

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,200
There are very scattered records about money cutting in Jintun in Chinese history

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,800
Distributed in history books, local characters and some notes

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,000
The time span is relatively long, starting from the Han Dynasty

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
until contemporary

44
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,200
presumably can be disconnected probably in 1949

45
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Because this after 1949

46
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,200
Many newspapers and periodicals are actually in mainland China

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
i can't collect

48
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
So basically I probably won't discuss

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
There are records about this

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,400
let's start now

51
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
purpose of this study

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,000
mainly through data analysis

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,600
The natural history of fine hoarding

54
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,800
With this space-time background stranded with it

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
The reason for the shallow cut and the cultural explanation

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
is also the part I'm going to discuss

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
But it's a pity

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Written Records of Chinese Social Pollutants and Governance

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,100
Relatively probably a little more than the West and Japan

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,000
But there is very little image data

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,200
And even with this profile of this image

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,700
It draws this fine and shallow look

63
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,300
also very ridiculous

64
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,000
You can read from that poster

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
can be seen

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,440
The one on the seal is basically from the late Qing Dynasty

67
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,740
"Time is in the pictorial"

68
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,680
A picture drawn of Jintun Shallow

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,400
But he drew the goldfish to look like a carp

70
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,980
It also represents our traditional literati

71
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,680
I'm drawing this about the sea

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,880
Huge catch-like animals when

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,580
their understanding

74
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,480
He and these fishes inland

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,920
almost the same

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,780
From this perspective

77
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,080
In fact, far behind

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Japan and the West

79
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,820
We'll see a picture later

80
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
That's a picture of the West

81
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,360
in Chinese history

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,760
Crunchy Jintun shallow record

83
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,860
probably belong to the two sides

84
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,060
in 16 BC

85
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,260
In the place Beihaijun in Shandong

86
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,060
Once there was a big fish shallow

87
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,140
on this coast

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Six long and one tall, there are four in total

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Then in 4 BC, probably in Donglai County, Shandong

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There is also Lantau cutting money in Pingdu

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There are seven in total, all dead.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In AD 173 also in Donglai County

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The sea pushed two more Lantaus onto the coast

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Its length is eight or nine sheets, and its height is about one sheet.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The terms used by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to cut money from Jinyintun

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In fact, until now, especially in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Even in modern times, some people are saying that this phenomenon is called sea pig Lantau

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It refers to gold and copper cutting money

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I just said that this is a plate of Henan in the West

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,300
We drew this goldfish cutting pliers

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,000
That's a pair of incense-smeared gold cutting pliers

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
it's very realistic

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,200
Even its genitals are drawn

104
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,800
And it can be seen from the ratio of it to people.

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,800
But we in China are very short of such image materials

106
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,200
And the director of the painting is very wrong

107
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,600
it's a pity

108
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,300
On the Japanese side, in fact, because of their tradition

109
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,000
The supplementary gold industry is very developed

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,300
So they were in the 17th and 18th centuries

111
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,300
There are also many pictures of this kind of supplementary money left behind.

112
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,700
Images of various types of gold painted inside

113
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,500
are also very accurate

114
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,900
China may have entered the sea in the long-term Ming and Qing Dynasties

115
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,800
And the message to the ocean is not that big

116
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,200
Therefore, the first image data left is very little

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,300
The second factory manager is not accurate

118
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,300
we're going to take a look now

119
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,800
There are some records about Jintun’s offshore activities in Chinese history

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
give some examples

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,300
First of all, in Hebei near Shangguan Customs

122
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,200
on the coast of this place

123
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,800
it is documented

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,300
There will be a very large fish in this place

125
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,900
This is called bigger than a square

126
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,800
called yellow croaker

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
sometimes it cuts shallow on the shore

128
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,000
After the locals cut the meat

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
take it to boil oil

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,000
This record lasted from the Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,400
There are relevant records

132
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
until the Republic of China

133
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,500
Here in Bohai Bay

134
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,000
Fishermen of this generation in the Bohai Sea

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,100
still call the gold class the old yellow croaker

136
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,200
But the name of Jintun in various places

137
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,300
It's not the same

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Hebei called yellow croaker

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But this Shandong coast

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,600
also known as squid

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,500
For example, it is said in a record at the place of the yellow line in the last year of the dynasty that

142
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,000
He said that this fish is often ten or twenty feet long

143
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Every time they are active on the sea, they are in groups of three or four

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and spray that wave

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It looks like it's snowing

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Anyway, his record is quite realistic.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's because Jintun has a habit

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It will spray air upwards in front of the air hole

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The jet will cause a shower of snow that looks like

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
In it, he also specifically recorded that this kind of Jintun

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He can even swallow a boat when his mouth opens

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So sometimes it's called swallowing a boat

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There are relevant records until the Republic of China

154
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There is a man in Wei County, Shandong, who is a scholar named Chen Hengqing

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He mentioned in it that the place near the sea is often

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There will be dragon soldiers on the sea

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Jintun

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,140
Dragon soldiers

159
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,780
Dragon soldiers pass by

160
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,340
The leader of the gunfish

161
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,340
There will be holes in the top of the fish

162
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,740
it jets

163
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,140
The breath comes out and there is sound with sound

164
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,140
looks like a cannon

165
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,840
This is the record in Shandong

166
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,140
Now let's see that this is

167
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
the way it blows

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,340
But in Jiangsu this place is called

169
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,740
There is nothing special about Jintun class

170
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,040
some titles

171
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,640
But it is most often referred to as

172
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,940
a very large fish usually called a quarter fish

173
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Sometimes it's funny when you read this record

174
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,140
Just think it looks like a carp

175
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,240
and it will be in

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,200
This one on the sea is tumbling in the air

177
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,400
This is of course a very realistic record.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This place in Fujian is quite special.

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,700
that is

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,440
For example, in Fujian, let’s look at the Matsu

181
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,800
This place in Lianjiang County

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,600
It is recorded that they often have

183
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,000
Four species of this fish related to Jintun

184
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
what's their name

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,500
But the first one he called the porcupine fish

186
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,800
He said that the nose will spray air

187
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,900
In addition, CNOOC

188
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,300
That's the biggest possibility

189
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,800
Refers to this relatively large type of gold

190
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Another third type is called sea pigs

191
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,700
But if you use this local dialect

192
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,600
How about comparing this sea pig with a sea pig?

193
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Put it all together, it might actually be the same fish

194
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,300
That's the dolphin

195
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,300
It's actually the same as that A and that sea pig.

196
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,500
But he recorded that it is divided into two types

197
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,900
In addition, he also recorded a fourth species called cross fish

198
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,700
That

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,760
In this cross fish, it is also specifically written that

200
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
it belongs to shark

201
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,160
but you get used to it

202
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,660
That is to say, we have the habit of looking at the records behind it.

203
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:15,360
you know it's probably tiger spirit or something

204
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
It's closer to that

205
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,460
Shark-like teeth are sharp

206
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,060
And it's the biting kind

207
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,060
that's how it rolls

208
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,060
Because if a shark doesn't have this habit

209
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,060
In short, basically in this place in Fujian

210
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,060
The records of fine buttocks are relatively detailed

211
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,060
Of course, the classification above in traditional records is sometimes compared

212
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:50,060
Not so different from our modern natural history classification

213
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
At that time it was more traditional

214
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,060
So it's not very precise, it's actually inevitable

215
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,060
Then this is what I just mentioned, it is more like the sand

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
floating gold

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
his appearance

218
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
because of the most important feature behind him

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Just like a shark, his fins

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
he will show the tail fin

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and he looks like a shark

222
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now let's look at Taiwan

223
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
is Taiwan

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
he continued this

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There are some names that are actually a bit like Southern Fujian

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He speaks in our Taiwanese Hokkien dialect

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
just hi ang

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like this pig spiral in Kangxi

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The record is Hayon

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He is Haiyou

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
can swallow a boat

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
on the lake water

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
this color on that back

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's like a bull's back

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The latter record is the most interesting

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That is to say, as long as he appears

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the big one will appear

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe there's a typhoon or something like that

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
this storm comes out

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
in 1722

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In fact, there was an official in the Qing Dynasty who was ordered

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
Come to Taiwan form

243
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,440
it's in it's this

244
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
inside this record of the form

245
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
jellyfish

246
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
he said probably

247
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
This local fisherman told him

248
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,940
About three or four thousand catties

249
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,440
The small one weighs about a thousand kilograms

250
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,940
that sometimes called

251
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,140
another name

252
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,940
for example

253
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,620
Later he mentioned this, this sea

254
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,480
sea ​​tree

255
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,980
In fact, in Taiwanese, it is Haidu.

256
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
That is the head looks like a pig

257
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,580
The big one weighs about a thousand catties

258
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,260
The small one is about five or six hundred catties

259
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,260
That likes to get up on the water

260
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Then this is very similar to the habit of that dolphin

261
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,600
This is the record of Taiwan

262
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,260
Actually quite a lot

263
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,260
Just moments

264
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
let's see now

265
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
This coast of Guangdong

266
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,760
Its record actually has some

267
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,760
With Minnan and the one just mentioned

268
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,260
The record in the northern part of the lake is almost the same

269
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
You see, the first type is sea pigs

270
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,760
that ball is the second category

271
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
The third category is called Baifeng

272
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
thanks to the wind

273
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,760
it means big

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Much like this sea pig but he likes to jump

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But I think this one might be related to Class A.

276
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
In fact, it was when he was observing

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What you see is his different shape

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In addition, there is a record in the political years

279
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is of course closer to the South China Sea.

280
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This, that, Zhao Qingfu, this place

281
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's in the Yangjiang area

282
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He has three types of gold

283
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The first type is called sea loach

284
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The second type is called cattle fish

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
third call

286
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then in terms of his category

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
basically already relatively possible

288
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
slightly better

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That is to say

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
tradition for that

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Especially after the Ming and Qing dynasties

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
As for the activities of that goldfish on the surface of the sea

293
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And his classification has begun to be more detailed

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Before the Ming Dynasty, there were relatively few

295
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There was just a document mentioned above

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's his goldfish on the back of his fish

297
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
sometimes some

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
parasitic things

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's actually Fujitora

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Fujitora will parasitize in

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Especially this sad one with some whales

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
there are some records

303
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
it's not just on the sea

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And it has already swam into the inner river and the inner border

305
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There are many records

306
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The earliest record is in AD 837

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There is a big fishing ground slipping up

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Swim from that Yellow Sea into this Huaihe River

309
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
later on that

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Many people in this place killed him

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That was until the early years of the Republic of China

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In this Haizhou area is the Lianjiang

313
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The one near Lianyungang

314
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
because there are some

315
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
there are some rivers

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It was dug by hand

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This kind of river connected with the canal

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There will often be some Jintun Lie swimming in

319
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
One of them is Guanhe

320
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
But every July and August

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There is that Uyghur gold

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,800
He swam inward from that estuary

323
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
but he is weird

324
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,600
He swam to one place and went back

325
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
That place is in the Dragon King Temple

326
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
So the local folks said that it was a goldfish to worship the Dragon King

327
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I'll go back after saying goodbye

328
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,000
The Yangtze River is very special

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,400
Everyone knows him because of the Yangtze River

330
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
The Yangtze River is very wide

331
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
The collar is also very large

332
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,400
So this goldfish he swam in

333
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
sometimes very big

334
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,800
For example, in the Southern Tang Dynasty

335
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
During the Five Dynasties, when the descendants of the Southern Tang Dynasty

336
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,400
There is a big sea ball

337
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,800
he started from

338
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,200
He described it as a big body

339
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,800
cut money there

340
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,200
It says that the long tree is a funeral

341
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Near the current Jiujiang

342
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,200
That's the place in Jiujiang, Hukou of Boyang Lake, where the money is cut.

343
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Then why can we judge that he is Jintun class?

344
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,800
Because he was still spraying water when he was on fire

345
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
It's the water, it's the air

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Spray paint from the brain

347
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
The following is the one about Dongting Lake

348
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
It is recorded in the young magenta clay potion of Dongting Lake that

349
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,900
This fisherman in the area of ​​Dongting Lake

350
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,500
will catch this jerk

351
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,800
This is Jiang hip

352
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,800
It may be a different experience than the one swimming in above.

353
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,300
Use various schemes to catch

354
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,800
looks a little cruel

355
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,000
In fact, the record of the buttocks of the Yangtze River is very early.

356
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,300
Someone once verified that

357
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,200
There is a word in goose and duck called remember

358
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
This should be that white butt

359
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,300
that of course might be a bit far fetched

360
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,400
However, we can see from the records in the literature that

361
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,100
That is, at least in the Ming Dynasty

362
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,900
like in 1564

363
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
In fact, in this Jiangnan area

364
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,700
There is such a record of Bai Jiyu

365
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,500
he is white

366
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,200
later cut money

367
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,900
Of course this record is very special

368
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,800
That is to say, at that time, there were many sea areas heading towards this area.

369
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
This Xinyangjiang this

370
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,900
Jiangai

371
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's very loud, like a cow is braying

372
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
More than 1,000 people went to see

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But then there are some people who don't know what to do

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
swim into a small river port

375
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He was later found alive

376
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Just cut money on the river beach

377
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
was finally killed

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is Baijitun

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Of course Baijitun on the Yangtze River

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There is very little stock now

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Become a rare unarmed

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
have been included in their

383
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
China's protected animals

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
animal protection

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
In addition, we have to look at

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Like some aspects of this record

387
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Also this record is what the front hall said

388
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There are other related records

389
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is another picture of Baijitun

390
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
In fact, there are related records in Fujian

391
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
We won't talk about the relationship of time

392
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
This place in Jeonju is where we hold

393
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,800
This example is fine

394
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
It's at the Ma Xiang Hall in Jeonju

395
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,600
There was a record in this place that

396
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,200
It comes from this Tong'an County

397
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,500
A small river in the west is called Xixi

398
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
20 miles up

399
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,900
Now we're talking about that

400
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,500
about that Chinese history

401
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
This kind of space-time distribution of the money cutting in this gold mine

402
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I've read about this in total

403
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,000
in the relevant information

404
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are a total of 176 records related to this

405
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,500
among them

406
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,000
If we divide it according to the four major regions of China

407
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,800
Most of them are in the East China Sea

408
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,000
A total of 112 times

409
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,700
More than the sum of the other three sea areas

410
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Why is there more in the East China Sea?

411
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,900
maybe the first place is this place

412
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,200
This colorful shore line is relatively long

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,400
The second is that there are two relatively large rivers flowing into the East China Sea.

414
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,400
One is the Yangtze River and the other is the former Yangtze River

415
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Their estuaries are very large

416
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:18,900
near here because there are many lakes with living things and related fish

417
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,400
So Jintun will hunt here

418
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
may in some cases

419
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,300
He just cut money at the mouth of the Yangtze River and before the mouth of the Yangtze River

420
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:36,700
This is the classification of the approximate number of times

421
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,300
let's take a look

422
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,500
It's probably the season for him to cut money

423
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,100
About what months

424
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,400
First, there is an interesting record

425
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,800
It was in the Jin Dynasty that there was a book called Gu Jinzhu

426
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,700
he mentioned goldfish

427
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,400
Because the ancients regarded this gold as a fish

428
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
So I held on to them

429
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,740
In fact, it should not educate

430
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,240
Where is the goldfish hiding in May and June?

431
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,740
give birth on the shore

432
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,240
Then in July and August, it will guide this

433
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,440
It's this paper towel and it returns to the sea

434
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,440
There will be some walruses on one side and the other will be different

435
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Well, there are other records that say

436
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Like the sunny side of this generation in Shandong

437
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Its silkworm season is not in May and June

438
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
it is march in spring

439
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Then he said that gave birth to this little fish?

440
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
eyes are not open yet

441
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
But it's bigger than three houses

442
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,440
That's probably why this place is so miserable

443
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Maybe it's a false alarm or something.

444
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,440
bigger

445
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,680
What's more interesting is that

446
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,640
In the meaning of Liao disaster

447
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,780
Record Shandong Binghai people

448
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,380
he has a habit

449
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,740
That is to say, before and after the Ching Ming Festival

450
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,380
will see the heavy rain in this sea

451
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,080
Take his little fish to the sea

452
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,580
go around on land

453
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,300
The locals describe it as

454
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,500
That is to ask that to bring this son and daughter here

455
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,900
That one is called Baimu

456
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,400
Of course this is my own imagination

457
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,100
human imagination

458
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,400
Other records are of course different.

459
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,100
Maybe the latitude of each sea area

460
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,940
It's different from the temperature of the sea water

461
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,980
So they are miserable

462
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,200
It's not the season of misfortune

463
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,380
Like this area in southwestern Guangdong

464
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,500
Records on this sea

465
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,440
That is to say they were in February

466
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,900
From this record

467
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,100
We don't care how many pages he breeds here

468
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,200
It can be seen that in this coastal place

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

470
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,800
This place, this ocean, this environment are very good

471
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,700
So at that time the Jintun class

472
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,500
still very much distributed

473
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Then I have done statistics on that record

474
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,700
This incident in that shallow month

475
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,900
Use this record for statistics

476
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Among them, there are about 30 cases in spring.

477
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,200
Because there are some documents he only records the year

478
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
I won't remember the month and season

479
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,100
Some are seasons and some are years

480
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,900
So carefully remember the month

481
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,300
Basically, this figure is relatively speaking

482
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,200
not so much

483
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,500
But now we can see

484
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,200
That is to say, spring is the most

485
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,300
the rest is next in autumn

486
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,000
But the numbers in summer and autumn are not much different.

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,900
Generally speaking, spring 30

488
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,600
Most are spring 30

489
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,800
least winter 21

490
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,000
In fact, there is not much difference in numbers.

491
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,200
So I can't see if they have a specific

492
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
That is to say, in a certain season can

493
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,400
They are easier to cut money

494
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,000
so now we're going to look at

495
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,900
This is the place where the money was cut

496
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,700
Let's look at this picture

497
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,500
This picture is actually very obvious that it can be seen

498
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,400
It's the place where he cut money

499
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,500
The first one is in the Bohai Bay

500
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,900
It's just what we said

501
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,400
People in Hebei call it Huangyu

502
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,100
It's near the Shanghai Customs

503
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,800
On this north side of Bohai Bay

504
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,000
what about this place

505
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,100
There are relatively many records of cutting money

506
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,000
The second is Laizhou Bay

507
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
from the two men

508
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,700
Laizhou Bay has a lot of records

509
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,700
That is to say, we just talked about Beihai County

510
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Laiju County

511
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,200
This place is early

512
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were relatively more places in this place

513
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The third place is Haizhou Bay in the north of Intermodal Port

514
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
This place borders Shandong and Jiangsu

515
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It is also a place with a relatively large curvature.

516
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The vicinity of the intermodal port is because it was the outlet of the Yellow River in the Ming and Qing Dynasties

517
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because the Yellow River once sucked the Huaihe River

518
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
go to sea from here

519
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So the area around the intermodal port was also stranded. There are more records.

520
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The Yangtze Estuary is also a place with many records.

521
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
This is the second most

522
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Qiantang Bay is the place with the largest number of strandings in the entire record

523
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And we now record from the literature that it is the largest number of collective strandings

524
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
also appeared in former don wan

525
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
this place is special

526
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
is the place to bend the mouth

527
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The tidal action is sometimes relatively large

528
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
so everyone knows

529
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The Haining tide watcher appeared just to the north of the former guard

530
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
when his tide is in a certain season

531
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
especially during the mid-autumn festival

532
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
His tide is very high

533
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
This is famous all over the world

534
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That may be because of the Guanyin of the tide

535
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Will suck that with some of this fine ass this way

536
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
So what about his Ji Zai?

537
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
relatively more

538
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The other number that collectively stranded

539
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
we'll give it later

540
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
next is

541
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
wednesday island generation

542
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
wednesday island generation

543
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Because his island is also distributed more

544
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And it is the largest fishing ground in China

545
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
All kinds of fish are here

546
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
there are a lot of resources

547
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
There are many fish resources

548
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Maybe Jintun is here to supplement the food.

549
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The situation is also more obvious

550
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
that sometimes in some

551
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
They ran aground by accident

552
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
this is that number

553
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Everyone can take a look

554
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,500
There are a total of 45 incidents in Qiantangwan and 35 incidents in the mouth of the Yangtze River. These are the two largest and most

555
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,500
The reason for the song spring, the traditional records about the song spring, why is there a song spring? There are very few records of this

556
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:30,500
The first record tells that the ocean will have this kind of inertia every autumn.

557
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,500
It will start to be called a habit that will push some things on the sea surface to the land

558
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:42,500
The local people recorded that these are the three sayings about the people nearby

559
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,500
He said it would push something up

560
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:52,500
push push push some damn fish inland

561
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Pushing up this phenomenon is called Xihai

562
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:00,500
So in the process some big fish will also

563
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
just up there

564
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
The Western missionary at the end of the Qing Dynasty once mentioned that

565
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Why are there so many front halls?

566
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
They also observed that more

567
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Then what he said was

568
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Because that's a funnel shaped bay

569
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That tide is so big

570
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So he becomes that whale's trap

571
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Will suck this goldfish over and die here

572
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So this is a more scientific statement

573
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But even if the current scientific research is not clear

574
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Why is there Jintun

575
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Why did Jintun cut the money and go there

576
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
In fact, there are many sayings now, and there is no specific one.

577
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It is a conclusion that can fully explain

578
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Next we'll look at the scale

579
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So we're going to look at the scale

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,400
First, let's take a look at a record in Taiwan.

581
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,200
This record is in the ninth year of the dragon

582
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,800
Nasutu, the civil governor, once reported that

583
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:17,200
That last year was December 18 of the previous year

584
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Baishatun in Hokuriku, Taiwan

585
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,400
Baishatun is in the area of ​​the current night

586
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,000
that all night with that

587
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
22 very large fish

588
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That mow dives into that sea

589
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
What about the head he said?

590
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The mouth of the big tent fish is four feet wide

591
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
That belly is two tent tail big heptapod

592
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Then his description said that the tail is very similar to the tail of a shrimp

593
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But it's fish body, etc. There are some related records

594
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
It's not dead yet, it's screaming like a cow, that cow is screaming

595
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
At that time, it was not yet fully

596
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
It's just that the tide may not have fully receded yet.

597
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,200
It's the shallow tide

598
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,900
don't know what it's called

599
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,200
more interesting it has a follow up

600
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,400
It was when this mantra was reported to the former Dragon Emperor

601
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
The former Dragon Emperor later issued an order

602
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,400
Just pointed down and said show me that fish painting

603
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Later, Nasu land was called Taiwan government.

604
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
After painting the soil

605
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,400
Dust to the former Dragon Emperor

606
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,200
But now we are on the Forbidden City archives

607
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,400
It's a pity I can't find this soil

608
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,100
In addition, of course, the above is the record of the mantra

609
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,400
Below we are the records of Taiwan's government system

610
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,600
That description isn't much different either.

611
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,400
In addition, comrades were in Yilan in 1872

612
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,000
This seaport in Gemaran

613
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,700
It is now the estuary of Lanyang Creek

614
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,500
There are 7 heavy rains also cut shallow in that place

615
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,100
At the same time, if you intend to entrust it to Danshui, you will also cut shallow

616
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
that's pretty big

617
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Then in 1881

618
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
This deep storm also reported that in the Hengjiang area

619
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Where is this Hengjiang?

620
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's probably a little bit inside the Qiantang River

621
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
There are a lot of this fish dove dive

622
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
inexplicable

623
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Its inexplicable name is very large

624
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
even that boat iron lock

625
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It seems that the iron locks all the ones near the Hengjiang River

626
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Stopped, the boat can't pass

627
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
That record is the one I found with the largest number

628
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Qiantangjiang

629
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is the pigeon dive of a certain countryman

630
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That this one is in a foreign country

631
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
are dead

632
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,960
The records of Jintun in Gequan in the traditional literature

633
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,320
Some records are very clear and some are very exaggerated

634
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,320
The number is somewhat, for example, a few examples

635
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,400
There is a record that once recorded that it was more than a hundred feet

636
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,600
Of course we will think this is an exaggeration

637
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,560
Anyway, it's an adjective, so we have to take it seriously.

638
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,920
However, there are some records that the recorded size is very fine

639
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,400
Most of the records can be seen

640
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,680
That is, if we look at the three grids in front

641
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:39,880
That is, the largest number is about six feet to ten feet.

642
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,320
previous most

643
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,360
But there is a second one that is tens of feet long

644
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,560
This one is at the back where there are nineteen records

645
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,600
Probably we can see from this record

646
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,560
It's the approximate number

647
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,360
Probably from this size to that size

648
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,560
Most of them are under 20 accounts

649
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,840
That's probably the place where the yellow color is on top of me now.

650
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,600
Said about 20 tents about 60 meters

651
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,400
In fact, this is to use the official account to go to that

652
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,600
But what we need to know is that the Chinese folk

653
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,000
That is to say, every place they have will have their own one called Xiaozhang

654
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That is, they are like our golden food in private

655
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Gold grain is not the same

656
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The public gold is different from the general Taiwan gold

657
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that would be relatively small

658
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:43,000
So that is to say, if we convert it into the relatively small folk tent

659
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It may be relatively smaller

660
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But we, I really can't find out what the number of its luxury tents is in each place, and I don't remember much.

661
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Probably strictly speaking, if we divide it by two-thirds or half

662
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,120
The size of this is about four or five

663
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,860
It's about 40 to 50 meters at most, and it's already very big.

664
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,760
In fact, pigeons dive these big fish in the sea

665
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,060
It's what it's called. It's different in different places.

666
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,760
all we've just said

667
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,260
The picture we see below is also a picture of the West

668
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,960
also a kind of engraving

669
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,960
People's paintings are relatively normal

670
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,460
And this pair is interesting

671
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,620
That is, he recorded the scene and still has the size of an elephant

672
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,980
Compared with the military instrument of the pigeon dive

673
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,180
and horses and people

674
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:42,480
In fact, it is impossible to exaggerate to say more than 60 meters

675
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,980
That size is actually very, very scary

676
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,980
probably unlikely

677
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,780
The following is an analysis of some cases of death

678
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,680
Some records will be recorded in a special way

679
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,780
that is why he died

680
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,900
For example, there is a record that said he

681
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,640
There was a man whose father was an official in Haicheng County, Zhangzhou Prefecture

682
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,980
One day when he was an officer, he saw two big fish peeling beans on the sea

683
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:17,980
Three days after the peeling, a fish got stuck on the reef in the sea

684
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,520
Can't move on the reef next to the Han

685
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,560
Probably one of them has already left

686
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,720
Then this money cutting died on this reef

687
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:37,520
We know that even the gold species will actually supplement their own kind.

688
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,920
For example, Fu Jin is the most familiar to everyone.

689
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,860
So he asked Fujin to attack those such as blue gold or virtual gold

690
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,280
Then this record may be relatively speaking

691
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,080
A record of Fu Jin going to attack other gold classes

692
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,740
This is Fukin

693
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,160
Bite other coppers

694
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Also, it will be recorded that

695
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,160
It is especially easy to cut money in the gold mine during the storm

696
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,360
This was about seven or eight years ago

697
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,560
In this place in Haiyan County, Northern Subei

698
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,960
There is a photo of that township cutting money

699
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
many people run

700
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,360
It is even recorded that

701
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,360
It is said that some people cut the meat and cooked it

702
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Another record is that the tide suddenly rose

703
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:43,360
In particular, the typhoon washes up the sea water in the nearby sea area.

704
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Traditionally, this kind of sea area will be called

705
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,360
would push some really big fish up the shore

706
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
After the push they cut the money

707
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
This record is relatively more

708
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,360
This is a photo from France

709
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,160
After the storm, this virtual crystal was left in that place

710
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,600
What's more special is that there are two records related to the earthquake

711
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,640
But those earthquakes are actually far behind in time.

712
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,040
We're not entirely sure if it's just an earthquake under the sea.

713
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:35,040
Sometimes there are records of some heavy rain

714
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,600
It dies and is slaughtered on the sea

715
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:44,800
This can be seen in the modern photos I collected

716
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,000
The most frequently documented is why they cut money

717
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,200
I mean, they go after fishing boats or merchant ships.

718
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,800
Keep chasing and chasing, the boat will sail in

719
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,380
That river port, they still continued to chase

720
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,980
As a result, the river channel inside is relatively shallow.

721
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,980
he cut shallow

722
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
There are many records of this kind in the Qing Dynasty

723
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,480
And this place in the south of the Yangtze River is very special

724
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,340
Like this place is the home of Xinfu in the north of Zhejiang, Pingwu County

725
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,340
scam this place

726
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,280
Finally we're going to do a tidy up

727
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,280
there is a cultural explanation for that cut

728
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,280
In fact, when the Chinese explain this about the fact that the military settlements are shallow

729
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,280
Sometimes it's you speaking from your current perspective

730
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
is relatively unlearnable

731
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,280
He used a kind of yin and yang or Mingxin.

732
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,280
For example, after the Song Dynasty, this military settlement began to appear.

733
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
It's actually the dragon king.

734
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Throw some of that misbehaving or guilty fish into the army

735
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,280
where to rush to land

736
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,280
so he will be

737
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,200
push inland

738
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,560
This earliest record is the same as what was just mentioned

739
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:13,600
It started to appear in the heavy rain in Jiujiang before Li Hou's ancestral song

740
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,840
Of course, similar records are also mentioned in Ouyang Xiu's poems later.

741
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:23,040
Until the Qing Dynasty, there was still the same saying

742
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,800
That is to say, Jin Tun Geqian is because of his guilt

743
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,560
before exile after guilty conviction

744
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,840
Kairyumaru or Kami will take his eyes off

745
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,840
As a result, he lost his way

746
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,160
This was also said in Taiwan at the end of the Qing Dynasty

747
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,440
In addition, there is another special

748
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,360
Sometimes before the song, it is because he is pressed by a big magic shrimp

749
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,240
Of course, this big shrimp is actually linked to what we just talked about.

750
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,000
The one that was confiscated by Kairyu Maru

751
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,880
Of course, this magical shrimp may actually be pressing the big fish to push it onto the land.

752
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,840
So there will be some records like this

753
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:14,440
But sometimes if we interpret the common people like this

754
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,400
Probably the result of his visual misreading

755
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,160
because of some big false alarms

756
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,280
Especially when he rolls on the sea

757
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,040
when his two fins rolled over the sea

758
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,720
It's like two big boils of shrimp

759
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,720
So let's take a look, very much like

760
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,000
So if you look from far away on the coast

761
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,960
I thought it was just a shrimp

762
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,200
At the same time, when he was active with him

763
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,280
there will be other Jintun species next to it

764
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,480
Maybe soon there will be Jintun class to cut the money

765
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:59,640
They think this is the fish that God Shrimp was charged with

766
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,600
Interestingly, a saying that appeared later is called Runyu

767
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,720
I mean they observe I don't know if it's true

768
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,760
It means that generations began to observe that

769
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,520
That Jintun Geqian at this time

770
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,920
often occurs during the lunar year

771
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,480
Especially the generation in the north of the Yangtze River estuary in northern Jiangsu

772
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,200
There are many records about this kind of legend.

773
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
So it is the so-called run fish legend

774
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,040
It will be there in the year of Meifeng Runnian

775
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,160
That Jintun was pushed ashore

776
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,440
After the Qing Dynasty, it became more detailed

777
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,760
say that every year

778
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,880
The fish that is pushed on will be very compatible with the current year's effect

779
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,680
and looks alike

780
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,640
For example, if it is the year of the child, it looks like a mouse

781
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,400
In that ugly year, his head will be like a bull

782
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,840
Well now we'll see later

783
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,760
Then this saying goes all the way to the Republic of China

784
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,000
In the early years, there was a famous fortune teller

785
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,400
This occultist is called Father Yuan

786
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,900
He's still in that secret book of his

787
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,900
also said that in 1909 when he

788
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,800
He and his friends are in Dongtai County

789
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,400
Dongtai County is also the north bank of the Yangtze River

790
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,700
This place mentioned that there is such a phenomenon

791
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,700
Then he started to push according to that over there.

792
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,600
Speak as if there is something wrong with Sa

793
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,800
in fact it is

794
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Now we'll look ridiculous

795
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,900
Sometimes it will be more detailed

796
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
It was during the Runnian period

797
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,400
he these and that were pushed into the rain

798
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,100
This typhoon is often accompanied by water

799
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,700
So this is understandable as we just said

800
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,300
That's when the typhoon

801
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,800
There will be a lot of that big rain appearing on the sea

802
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,600
That's when I talked about the typhoon just now

803
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,000
Later there will be that

804
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,900
Of course, this is a result of two interconnected

805
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,400
Then let's take a look at this phase-by-line phase-by-line phase-by-line

806
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,760
This is near the mouth of the Yangtze River

807
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,320
It's the Legend of Runyu compared to that

808
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,260
After the Qing Dynasty

809
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:13,600
Being demoted by the Sea Dragon King combined with the legend of Runyu

810
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,160
Of course it is more detailed

811
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,860
Let's see what this one looks like now

812
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,260
If it works

813
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,160
is it a bit like a snake

814
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,800
so they may be on the sea

815
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,600
Because of the angle, the head of the gold class is different

816
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,400
so they start talking nonsense

817
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,600
In short, the legend of running fish is a process of accumulation

818
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,860
The last part we're going to talk about is

819
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,360
This batch was ancient

820
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,700
Because in ancient times, when talking about cutting money in Jintun

821
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,300
often use a word

822
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,860
Just treat them as dragon sea dragons

823
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,500
or Dragon King Dragon

824
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,720
So we're going to see after Dragon's Dive

825
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,000
what's the end

826
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,480
The first record is the only one I found

827
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,840
There is a record of release

828
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,520
This record has appeared in the Guang Department for three years

829
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,160
In the place of Heavy Army Island

830
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,000
There is a language about seven or eight feet long before the song

831
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,400
but it's a special place

832
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,640
Seven or eight feet is actually not too big

833
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,640
But it found something on it

834
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,640
this one has a silver medal

835
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,640
The silver medal reads "Kangxi Seven Years Released"

836
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,640
That is to say, the phrase

837
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,640
In fact, in the seventh year of Kangxi

838
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,640
once cut shallow after shallow cut

839
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,640
pushed it back to the surface

840
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,140
It's still on the fish well in the middle

841
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,140
hanging a silver medal

842
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,820
but i feel

843
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,820
How to hang the silver medal

844
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,080
how is he hanging on the neck of this fish

845
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,600
Will it fall? It's unlikely.

846
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,640
that this

847
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,940
I think it might be a bit fictitious

848
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,020
But no matter that he mentioned this matter

849
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,320
That is to say, the Chinese used to be

850
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,840
have put this

851
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,900
The goldfish rescued

852
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,200
push him back to sea such a record

853
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,500
In fact, let's see some

854
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,840
Then we were going to talk about the record just now

855
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,920
When Jintun was pushed back to sea, he had resisted Qi for seven years

856
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,520
That connects to that later resisting Qi for seven years

857
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,560
These 100 years

858
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,360
Is that so?

859
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,800
Jintun with such a long life

860
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,400
Actually there are

861
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,240
It's the referendum

862
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,240
The referendum gold once recorded that he lived two hundred years

863
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,680
so but we don't know

864
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,000
Was that referendum money just now?

865
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440
good

866
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,940
In fact, what I just said is a lot of this

867
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
The pigeon dog incident is often used to fall into the cage

868
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,500
that from the cage or something

869
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,200
It's just that they don't know why this thing is here

870
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,200
So it is often said that they all thought they fell from the sky

871
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,700
Therefore, many records mentioned above mean that

872
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,600
This cage fell from the sky

873
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,500
after falling in that

874
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,300
Then there are some records that say there are some officials

875
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,000
That one even splashed water on him

876
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,800
Tell the common people to keep pouring water on him

877
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,600
Because he may be in pain over there

878
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,800
call over there

879
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,000
because he's about to splash

880
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,600
So ask the common people to pour water on him

881
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
But splashing water is useless

882
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,900
Because later he only wanted him

883
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,900
If he does not return to the law, he must die

884
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,200
died three days later

885
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
The meaning of Liao disaster really needs to be recorded

886
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,500
What about the local county magistrate?

887
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,700
I used this straw tin for 80 yuan

888
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,900
cover this dragon

889
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,500
In addition is

890
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Still worshiping him there

891
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,200
then you can see that is to say

892
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,200
It's impossible for a so-called dragon to fall from the sky

893
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,000
He must have somehow been washed into the river

894
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
or the one that fell on the beach

895
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Then finally we're going to start talking about this sacrifice.

896
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It is the one with the most sacrifices

897
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
The most sacrificed child is that he was cut off

898
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
meat cut to death

899
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
This sacrificial boy is more cruel

900
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Those songs are very detailed

901
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Then this sacrificial boy is a sacrificial ceremony in the early years of the Southern Song Dynasty

902
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Sacrifice is also very meticulous

903
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It also talks about cutting this off

904
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
How much does Jin's meat sell for?

905
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
It sells for more than 200 yuan per catty

906
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
It took 10 days to cut it

907
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
There are many related sacrifices, so we won't go into details

908
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Here is an example

909
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Some people were poisoned to death after eating this golden meat

910
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
maybe that one is corrupted

911
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
is that he is dead

912
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,200
And corruption results in children eating

913
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,600
Then some are sick and some are dead

914
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,300
We also have photos and we can see that Jintunei is dead.

915
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,500
In fact, he has already started to rot, the skin is already there

916
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,700
And the most common one

917
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,000
A lot of people cut it off and didn't eat it

918
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,400
mostly boiled oil

919
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,300
The record of boiling oil has been around since a long time ago.

920
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,700
There are many examples, so we won't go into details

921
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,900
This is Japan, they do not have a business. There is a picture in it

922
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,100
After cutting the upper part of the body

923
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,000
A picture of them starting to boil oil

924
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,300
sometimes there are some

925
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,900
Their skeletons will leave some fundamental

926
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,200
just let us know

927
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,300
This is Jintun using the ones from Jintun as some building materials

928
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,000
The most commonly seen is Jintun's

929
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,900
Especially the bones that should be gold are used as bridges

930
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,400
There are many records of this

931
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,600
This is the photo of the golden fish bone of Lanji

932
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,400
In addition, some people regard it as a good pillar

933
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,000
The most special thing in Zhuang Liangzhu is that there is a photo

934
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,400
Let's look at that photo first

935
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,500
There is a photo in the period of the Republic of China

936
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,000
It is mentioned that there is a magnetic hall in their family

937
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,200
There is a Wuliang in the middle of the magnetic hall

938
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,600
a string of words written on it

939
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,800
That string of characters is this

940
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,700
In the 20th year of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty, the first day of the first lunar month

941
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,200
word entry

942
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,200
It was the one that ran into Hong Kong with myself

943
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,600
It is the oracle bone of a sea mound in Hong Kong Harbor

944
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,400
used oracle bones to make their Wuliang

945
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,400
It also has the string of words written on it

946
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,800
this is very special

947
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,400
In fact, there are many records of unscrupulous temples or homes.

948
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,800
don't talk

949
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:12,800
There is also a record that Xiaojin was taken as a specimen after being separated from Qianqian.

950
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,200
This has come after the Republic of China

951
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,400
There is probably only one record that I found

952
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,400
But it is also possible that there are

953
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,000
But it's not recorded

954
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
In addition, sometimes it will be displayed in some places

955
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,600
For example, there are some temples that are most often released

956
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:37,200
For example, Xu Yue’s Jianwen Road talks about the water temple in Laizhou, Shandong.

957
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,400
Saw some big fish skeletons in that place

958
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,200
In addition, he also said that he used to be in the area of ​​Haizhou Joint Venture Port

959
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:51,600
I saw that the common people used this fishbone to make old things, etc.

960
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,200
This is the vanity of gold

961
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,200
It's the Xu on the mouth

962
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
it's funny

963
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
It's a photo of Xiyang

964
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
a photo of the west

965
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
he can take it

966
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
that someone

967
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The Chinese have ever taken him that

968
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
the one above

969
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
This thing on the lake

970
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
what to do

971
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
take it to numbers

972
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
This was recorded in the Tang Dynasty

973
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
one more special

974
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It's in that Weihaiwei place

975
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
placed at this gate of the park

976
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
that as a landscape

977
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
let's take a look

978
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That's the one

979
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
There is a place in Weihaiwei

980
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
The locals call it Shanjiao Park

981
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
because it's hilltop

982
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
this is gone now

983
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Because I used to go to Weihaiwei

984
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
to see this place

985
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
this is gone

986
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
that mouth this

987
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
where has been moved

988
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
This is the Republic of China

989
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
More than ten years of the Republic of China

990
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
we're coming to conclusions

991
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,200
about the time

992
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,300
The conclusion is probably that

993
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,500
The vast majority of extant cases are

994
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,600
The main record is after the middle of the night in the Ming Dynasty

995
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,000
Before the middle of the night in the Ming Dynasty, it was relatively scattered

996
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,200
that last point

997
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,400
Probably from the north bank of the Yangtze Estuary to that

998
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,300
Zhejiang Lane Shangan

999
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,300
that's the one

1000
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,100
The coast of Zhoushan Islands

1001
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:27,200
It is the place where the most gold is mainly cut

1002
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,200
Hangzhou Bay even has hundreds of

1003
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:32,400
Records of Jintun Separation

1004
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,700
Generally speaking

1005
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,000
Jintun's size

1006
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,400
The size of the cutout is about 10 pieces in length

1007
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,500
more than a few

1008
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,600
There is a relatively high possibility that it may be virtual gold

1009
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,900
and most of what we can now determine

1010
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,000
some are smeared gold

1011
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,500
gold class leave the world

1012
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,300
It's this souvenir from our world

1013
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,700
Actually quite a lot

1014
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,000
certainly

1015
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,940
The most obvious is probably

1016
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,440
The most common is Gouger

1017
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,940
So like I just said

1018
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,940
It's going to be used as frozen food, bridge food.

1019
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:13,140
Or chairs and stools and smart old

1020
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,440
There are even dug into steel

1021
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,740
Those who can raise whales have this

1022
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:22,140
in traditional times

1023
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,380
because there's nothing like a museum or anything

1024
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,640
Oceanarium or something like that

1025
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,180
places to collect this skeleton about Jintun

1026
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,380
So the most common way

1027
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,980
is often placed in the square of the temple

1028
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,580
that's about binhai

1029
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,680
Common people, they cut money from Jintun

1030
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,880
Explanations are of course full of cultural imagination

1031
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:52,080
Some of them are mystical

1032
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,080
I just said this

1033
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,580
That is to say, Dragonsea put this

1034
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,920
The bad fish rushed into the army

1035
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,020
besides

1036
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,740
Later it was said about the so-called

1037
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,340
It will appear during the Lunar New Year, etc.

1038
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,240
later joined together

1039
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,340
These actually represent a kind of thinking of human beings.

1040
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:14,340
In fact, it has no scientific basis

1041
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,240
The last thing I want to say is that

1042
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,540
After the great geographical discovery in the west

1043
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,340
Actually a lot of that kill goldfish

1044
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:36,580
Actually, and use this goldfish as a good fuel

1045
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,680
and lubricant

1046
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,080
But in China relatively because

1047
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,980
The frequency of goldfish cutting skirts is actually not too high

1048
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,280
In addition, China except the South China Sea area

1049
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,480
There is a supplement to this custom

1050
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,380
It's the Danmin of the South China Sea

1051
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,880
It's a kind of ethnic minority of the sea

1052
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,340
they will kill jintun

1053
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,080
except them

1054
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,400
Probably most of them will not take the initiative to go to sea without killing

1055
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,000
In this process, there can actually be a result

1056
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,600
It's the kind of poisonous milk that we use in the sea.

1057
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,600
is so relatively less

1058
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,800
So some Western scholars say that this is a big difference

1059
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,500
This is of course

1060
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:30,500
Okay, I'll probably report it here, thank you all

1061
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,000
Don't pay attention to the artistic conception and then don't pay attention to the reality

1062
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,200
That's because of this, so it affects everyone and won't do it deliberately.

1063
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
detailed records

1064
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
The appearance of goldfish cutting money

1065
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
then come again

1066
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
japan for goldfish

1067
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
It seems that there are more records

1068
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Because it is Putin's tradition

1069
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Then it was mentioned at the end that

1070
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Danming in southern China has such a culture

1071
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
that's curious

1072
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Is the lightness of southern China the same as that of Japan?

1073
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Is there any record of communication

1074
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
or mutual cultural influence

1075
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
This related history

1076
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
and then the third is

1077
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It is recorded that there are

1078
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
It is mentioned that PVT just now

1079
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
one word is

1080
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Everyone thinks it's weird because everyone thinks it's a weird thing

1081
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Then or someone feels that it is

1082
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It's the goldfish who's coming to worship

1083
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Come to Dragon King, I have to swim back again

1084
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
then or something even a fallen dragon

1085
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
dragon that fell from the sky

1086
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Then I'm curious, so the record inside

1087
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
mostly positive context

1088
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Still more negative context

1089
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Can positive or negative this be used as a

1090
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Will the current government use it to explain

1091
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Oh because of the country we govern now

1092
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
very common

1093
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
That's why God has images to make auspicious omens

1094
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
It's more like a negative

1095
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It is because the emperor of the previous era was married

1096
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So this happened in the previous era

1097
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
This kind of imaginative thing

1098
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Is it more positive or more negative?

1099
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Can it have a

1100
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
An explanation of the social atmosphere of that era

1101
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Li Chang

1102
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Okay, that's the first question.

1103
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I think your question should be certain.

1104
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
probably because

1105
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
But we can't actually find real evidence

1106
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Because the Chinese, of course, basically

1107
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
He is a literati, he is more interested in art

1108
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
It's more about artistic conception, that's right.

1109
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
But we might just have a possibility

1110
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Why does this kind of image data remain less

1111
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
The first is when this happened

1112
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
possibly local

1113
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It is possible to find that gold and pigeons are both

1114
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
fishermen living by the sea

1115
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,260
some local people

1116
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:07,400
Ordinary people, they may not actually have the ability to do this

1117
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,400
Said to keep it and draw it

1118
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,560
There are also some possibilities

1119
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,900
It's a fetish. You can't draw a fetish.

1120
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,860
There is a tradition, for example,

1121
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,900
I've been to that years ago

1122
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,860
Even three years ago, I went to the mainland for inspection.

1123
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,760
I took a camera to take pictures of that god

1124
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,000
The person who took the tour was Zi Zi who didn’t let me take pictures

1125
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,300
I just said we don't have this opportunity in Taiwan

1126
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,800
He said we can't do it in this place

1127
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,200
That is to say, the local people have been

1128
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,900
Even after the Cultural Revolution

1129
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,000
But they are concerned about God

1130
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,600
you can't take pictures of him

1131
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,400
can't even draw

1132
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,800
This may also be to some extent

1133
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,500
It can be explained that like the dragon

1134
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Or fetish they may feel they shouldn't draw it

1135
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
This is my conjecture with no evidence

1136
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The second question is whether this Danming has exchanged experience with Japan in their supplementary funds experience

1137
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
In fact, I can't see it at all from the literature.

1138
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That is to say, this may also be the lack of literature

1139
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:38,000
In fact, some people say that Danming, a sea group, appeared after the Southern Song Dynasty.

1140
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Of course it was possible earlier

1141
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:51,000
There is a group of people who may have traveled from Fujian to the Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam.

1142
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:57,000
They are the group of people who live on the water, they don't go on land very much

1143
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
That group of people occasionally

1144
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,400
but in some cases

1145
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,600
They go back to make up the money

1146
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,800
They don't dare to make up big money

1147
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,700
They found that tissue shoveled out in some seasons

1148
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:15,000
They shoot him with that fish mark

1149
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,600
After shooting him and letting him die at sea

1150
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,000
slow down

1151
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,700
drag it to the sand drag it to the sand to untie it

1152
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,300
boil after disintegration

1153
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,100
Because after all they need fuel at sea too

1154
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,300
so they are probably

1155
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,500
but not too many

1156
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:40,500
Records began to appear in the Ming Dynasty

1157
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,500
There was a Chongzhou in the Ming Dynasty

1158
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,700
Fuzhi, a state of political virtue, began to record that

1159
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:47,900
But tomorrow will make up money

1160
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,100
Every year, they will replenish paper towels in some seasons

1161
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,700
Because we don't know how the group got here

1162
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,700
maybe he's ugly

1163
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,620
It was related to Japan very early on.

1164
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:04,620
Or stay in Japan for a long time and they are related

1165
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:08,960
But there is absolutely no relevant research

1166
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,260
Talking about the relationship between the two ethnic groups

1167
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,260
Is there an absolute connection?

1168
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:16,760
Even with current affairs that probably lack documentation

1169
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,760
Of course everyone in Japan knows

1170
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,760
Even now there are still people

1171
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,760
Occasionally go to make up money

1172
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,260
So there's a documentary about a bay

1173
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,260
Inside a village bay

1174
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260
After they put him right into that bay

1175
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,260
intercept it at that estuary

1176
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,260
Then the whole sea is red

1177
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,260
cruel

1178
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:42,260
what is the third question

1179
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:48,260
I just want to know the positive side of the record.

1180
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,260
think of me

1181
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:54,260
In fact, I just mentioned the first earliest record

1182
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,260
It is the record of the Han Dynasty

1183
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,260
He is recorded in five elements

1184
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It is recorded in it that when those phenomena appeared

1185
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
It's negative, it's the heavenly scene

1186
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
It's the emperor, you didn't do well

1187
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
you can't handle some things

1188
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So that day has imagery

1189
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This fetish was rushed up

1190
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
This is asking the emperor to recruit himself

1191
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
There are also adjustments to be made in terms of governance

1192
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Later, it was extensively documented

1193
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
on the local word

1194
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It is also often recorded in the will

1195
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
in the will of course

1196
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
You start with the words that will

1197
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I know it's a kind of care

1198
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
It thinks that the appearance of this thing is not a good thing

1199
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
In addition, there are some literatures that say

1200
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I didn't just talk about

1201
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
that is to say some talk is to say

1202
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
as long as this kind of thing appears

1203
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
That reporter has a strong wind

1204
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Then we know that the southeast also sea

1205
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,760
Especially in Zhejiang and Fujian

1206
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,160
The most common occurrence is

1207
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,660
What is the so-called big front behind the so-called big front

1208
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,460
It's a typhoon or a big cyclone

1209
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,960
Although not to the typhoon level

1210
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,360
But it will make the whole coast

1211
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,960
Great changes in the weather began

1212
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,300
So I saw an actual record in Zhejiang

1213
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,960
They said that as long as they saw the sea station

1214
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,560
is Haiti

1215
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,720
when it rolls and bounces like this on the sea

1216
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,600
Everyone should be careful and start to be on guard

1217
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,100
So in other words, fishermen off the coast

1218
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,260
in the eyes of ordinary people

1219
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:43,460
If something like this happens, I'm afraid it will bring disaster.

1220
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:46,760
There aren't too many positive records.

1221
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,560
It is usually considered strange that this appears

1222
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,960
In fact, it includes one of the teasing disasters

1223
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,960
send it to this kind of thing, it will

1224
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,360
just show that it's not

1225
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,920
That is to say, in ancient times

1226
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,580
The rating is not particularly high

1227
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,660
Because if something like this happens

1228
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:03,860
Chinese people are actually curious

1229
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,160
Most will take it down

1230
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,760
but miscellaneous

1231
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,160
Of course, that is why after the Ming Dynasty there were more

1232
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,000
It is because there are more written materials left than before

1233
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,560
So there are relatively many records

1234
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,160
It may have been recorded before

1235
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,760
But after a while some books were passed on privately

1236
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,560
Or there are some official files

1237
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,860
Maybe he also reported to be an official

1238
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,160
but did not stay

1239
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,360
So generally speaking

1240
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,860
not too much positive

1241
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:37,360
usually taken as an image

1242
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,560
not a good sign

1243
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,360
right

1244
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,800
Then we thank the teacher for bringing us today

1245
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,260
our wonderful speeches

1246
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:44,960
Thanks

1247
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:45,900
Okay, thank you
