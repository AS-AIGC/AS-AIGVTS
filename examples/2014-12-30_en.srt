1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Bryce shrinking every minute...

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,080
Karamati because I needed...

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,120
life...

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,140
to jump over gate and man....

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,180
now Siro appears out of nowhere.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,240
He has two brothers and favorite….

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,200
so he is named 6...

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Siro appear in this movie.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,240
He has 4 brothers and 1 sister.

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,280
He always been before hisoscope.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,280
Here is a version.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,280
Lemmemayın siro S this thing

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,280
you have to get by ASAP.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Can much beat Master Ching Somebody's現在...

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Thank you.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,900
Yang Cuisheng, the former county magistrate of our Matsu County

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,900
mazu county magistrate

18
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,900
Members

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,900
today we have a

20
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
please sit down

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,400
The topic is

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,900
Archaeological excavations on Xianya

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,900
Talking about the Unearthed Story of the Old Man Liang

24
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,900
I want to measure what the old man unearthed

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,900
among the newspapers

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,900
in learning

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,900
reports with a lot of information

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
So these important archaeological excavations

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,300
Everyone must notice

30
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,100
our knowledge misses

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Because every year the humanities and social sciences

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,600
only four times

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,600
so it's a great honor

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,800
great honor

35
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
Then our Mr. Chen

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Actually retired from Academia Sinica

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
But his previous research

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,900
then schedule this talk

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,500
there is an important reason

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,700
It is the beginning of the data equivalent to the elderly

41
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,400
at the time of publication

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,000
Academician Xu Zhuoen of Academia Sinica

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
He Yueren is in the United States

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,920
Ancient archaeology, paleontology, DNA, etc. are very, very concerned

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,120
So he wrote me that email several times specifically

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,000
He said you as the vice president

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
he this is a major and important discovery

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He should try to give Mr. Chen an award

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I said I don't have a prize

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So so I don't have an award to give to Mr. Chen

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Especially the humanities and social science awards are very, very few

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then some prizes may be too small for Mr. Chen

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well at least I don't have it I don't have it

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I said I thought about it and couldn't think of a way

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Later, I thought that the feast of knowledge is actually an occasion for affirming important achievements

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So there is such an arrangement

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because Mr. Chen has usually knowledge feast if yours is usually not retired

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, those outside the hospital are of course still working.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,120
Because I have been retired for many years

60
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,320
So today we are looking for this opportunity

61
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,420
There is a reason for arranging this speech

62
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,880
Well, I think this is the first thing to explain

63
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,760
It is Xu Zhuoenyuan because he has ancient history before

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,840
He has been concerned about this ancient archaeological

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,840
very concerned

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,520
he this

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,840
I want to keep this around 2011

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,400
What about the Mazu Liang Island archaeological team led by Mr. Chen?

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,080
Execute excavation work

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,800
Well, two human remains were unearthed.

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,680
Named Bright Island Man

72
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
After the human bones have been cleaned and trimmed

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
Delivery to Max Planck, Germany

74
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,360
the Max Blanc Institute

75
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,440
To do this DNA extraction analysis

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,680
very good results

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,640
Because Taiwan is a wet

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
hot and humid place

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,640
So many of our ancient bones

80
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,560
Difficult to extract DNA

81
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,040
so this

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is surprisingly good

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,500
as far as i know

84
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
i am not an archaeologist

85
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,000
but as far as i know

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,700
unexpectedly good

87
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,500
So this is a very difficult achievement

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,000
Then after the comparison

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
got a result that is

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,700
Quantitative guides are 8000 years away from today

91
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,800
Or earlier, the southeastern part of the Asian continent

92
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
aborigines

93
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
people of the same blood

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Can be called the original Nandao Yuzu

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,000
They most likely came from the southeast coast of mainland China

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,500
thus come

97
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Therefore, the formation of the Nandaoyu tribe

98
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,000
can be pushed back nearly 8,000 years

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is because quite specialized

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
I can't quite grasp it either

101
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I am the Yu family from about 8000 years ago

102
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
8000 years ago this

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Then the other is today's keynote speaker

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,500
What about Professor Chen Zhongyi?

105
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
is my colleague for 30 years

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Actually, I just entered Academia Sinica

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,500
Has been in Academia Sinica for 30 years

108
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
So

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,100
when i first came in

110
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,800
when a child comes in

111
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,500
At that time, Mr. Chen was already

112
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,100
Madam save life

113
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,700
Mr Chen is a

114
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,800
An example of successful self-study

115
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,100
he in 1955

116
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,800
Entered Academia Sinica after graduating from high school

117
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
so he is very few

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,700
Among the colleagues we are familiar with now

119
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,300
Worked with Dean Hu

120
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,800
so used to

121
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,900
Mr. Chen also told me

122
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,600
Dean Hu follows this

123
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,200
meeting of academicians

124
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,900
There are many inside stories about conflicts with President Chiang

125
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,000
he was there

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
he was there

127
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,800
So he is a very senior colleague

128
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,000
He later worked in the Department of History

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,900
After graduating from the National Taiwan University Institute of Archeology

130
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,600
So officially become a researcher

131
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,000
but it is important that he

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,640
He is the assistant of Mr. Li Ji, the chief teacher of the third group of archeology

133
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,760
So he, a senior in archaeology who came into contact with

134
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,040
Much

135
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,100
Then after the 1980s

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,640
He changed from Taiwan

137
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,940
and marine island archeology

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,060
In Taipei County, Nantou County, Pingdong County, Hualien County, Taitung County, Kinmen County, Lianjiang County

139
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,880
has his important archaeological discoveries

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,960
Everyone, if you go to Puri, there is a site called Qubing

141
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,020
I remember that this site also presents this

142
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,120
The Bibing Site in Puri is now also a place to visit

143
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,940
So next time you go, you can pay a little attention

144
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,800
But more importantly, he discovered this 8,000-year-old historical record in Matsu three years ago.

145
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,360
Liangdao Ruins in the New Era

146
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,900
with two islanders

147
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,480
present this daily research

148
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,560
More professional research and less teaching in China

149
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,820
But he was also in Thailand

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,400
Xi Jinping University and Xiamen University have been visiting professors

151
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,600
He is also a member of the Art Center for Chinese Archaeological Research at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

152
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Honorary Research Fellow, Jianqiao University and University of California, Random Seven

153
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,000
And visiting scholars at the University of Arizona, the Department of Anthropology, etc.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,300
I think his efforts are very admirable

155
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,800
especially after he retires

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,200
There is another important discovery that I find very rare

157
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,100
So now we welcome him with a round of applause

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,000
associate dean

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,400
The incumbent Yang county magistrate

160
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Many colleagues in our institute

161
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,600
advanced

162
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
many my neighbors

163
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,100
my friend

164
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,700
And many friends outside our hospital

165
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,900
what a great honor today

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,760
I have the opportunity to report my recent work to the chairman

167
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,840
It has been fourteen years since Chen Rou Fuyuan talked about the special break

168
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,720
i have to do it again

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,600
So here are four opportunities

170
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm thinking

171
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,200
This is the Central Research Institute

172
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,200
I went from technician to researcher

173
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,800
Well actually like

174
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,080
knowledge miss this

175
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,680
This presentation is actually a dream of our researchers.

176
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
because we know

177
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,000
There are only four liberal arts students a year

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
There are thousands of people in our research institute

179
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,640
so i have a chance

180
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,560
Is to become the deputy dean's outsider

181
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,520
schedule this presentation

182
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,720
and all that I'm going to talk about today

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,840
story

184
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,280
nonstop story

185
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
this story

186
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
this is good

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There are so many links that link each other

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,400
Missing a link Our success rate

189
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
will not have a good success rate

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,200
this so slowly let me come

191
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,900
i think we forgot one thing

192
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,700
i just forgot one thing

193
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,300
I have a gift for Yang Xianchang

194
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,200
This gift can currently be opened without first opening

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,400
because wait a minute there will be

196
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,300
show something

197
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,400
Am I the vice president now, please?

198
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,800
Did I give it to him myself?

199
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,200
That's calligraphy on clothes

200
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,200
but you have one of my poems

201
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,800
wait a minute i will introduce

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,500
Our topic for this story today is

203
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,800
Archaeological treasures of Cliff Mountain

204
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,200
The story of the 8,000-year-old Ryoshima people

205
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,900
I divide five stories

206
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
Let's look at the following

207
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,200
First of all, what I want to introduce is to ask

208
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Any ladies and gentlemen who have been to Matsu raise your hands please

209
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
Wow so much

210
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
I watched half of it

211
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,200
very good very good thank you thank you

212
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,000
This Mazu is really the one that Dean Fu mentioned just now.

213
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
It's a beautiful scenery

214
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,000
does not belong to greek love sea does not belong to mediterranean

215
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
So where are the two islands?

216
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,700
It is the location between Beigang and Dongying, which is 27 kilometers away.

217
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll talk about its importance in a moment

218
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,500
let's see the next one

219
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,100
So this is the two islands

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,860
to some seaside many in Matsu

221
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,440
This island is all of this flower dry rock structure

222
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,440
let's look at these

223
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,940
look again

224
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,440
we can see this

225
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,200
That view is all mainland fishing boats

226
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,640
That's the mainland

227
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,400
Looking west from here is the mainland

228
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,000
let's take a look

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,440
Its shellfish are of course island shellfish

230
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:38,000
Mostly herbaceous

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
few woody plants

232
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,240
But there are also paper vines that are good plants

233
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
let's take a look

234
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,240
This is also a characteristic of Mazu

235
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,240
migratory bird of its seabird season

236
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,680
When they arrive they have apotheosis

237
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Empty end fit

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
this tern

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
we look good

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
that's what tern means

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Mainland fishing boats often fish there

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
we look good

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is the first story

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
how to tell the first story

245
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the first story says

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The Liangdao archaeological site is reserved for those who are destined

247
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
how do you say this

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's go back to the map just now

249
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
that map

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That map just now

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
right

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The location of Liangdao is because it is between Beigang and Dongying

253
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
When our two sides are facing each other

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
its positional importance

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If this island is not guarded by our national army

256
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This cold line will be cut

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
will be cut off

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
let's see and go back

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,500
when is this island

260
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
It was the first time that the national army boarded to occupy this island

261
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Because it was an uninhabited island

262
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
In fact, this island is no stranger to the Matsu people.

263
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Mount Heng in ancient times

264
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
it is no stranger

265
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,000
Also like the fishermen of Daegu Island in Kitaoka

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Now many fishermen are talking

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,500
The fisheries there are very rich

268
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
go fishing there

269
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
very strange

270
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,500
But because of its importance when cross-strait confrontation

271
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
so then what

272
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,500
When was this called and changed it to Langdao

273
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
The waves of the waves we don't know

274
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
no way

275
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
That's July 15, 1951

276
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
At that time the national army

277
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
We now call it the National Army

278
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
It's actually called the National Salvation Army

279
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
That is a force army of Emperor Fan

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,580
He has a Captain Li Chengshang

281
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,280
led six landowners

282
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Seven people went up to plant the flag

283
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,780
After that we will occupy the island

284
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,780
But at that time, because of the supply, the island

285
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
very difficult

286
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,780
It is very difficult to replenish Lulu Deficiency

287
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,540
so sometimes there is occupation

288
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
sometimes there is no way

289
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,040
just wait

290
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,240
until 1965

291
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,240
It was confirmed that a group of troops went up

292
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
But in 1966

293
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,240
At that time Chiang Ching-kuo

294
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,640
when he was the secretary of homeland security

295
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
he changed the name

296
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,040
He thinks it is the island standing in the sky that shines on the mainland

297
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
So change to Liangdao

298
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
The name was changed at that time

299
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,840
Then in 2011

300
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,840
At that time there was a commemorative meeting on the island

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,300
60th anniversary commemoration

302
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
I'll tell his story later

303
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Let's see the next one

304
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,300
at this time

305
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,500
because of this commemoration

306
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,500
You just invited Li Chengshang for this cup

307
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,800
The original team members are now among the seven

308
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Now there are only two left

309
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,800
He was invited to attend this meeting

310
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,600
Go and see what the island is like now

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
when

312
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,700
County Magistrate Yang invited by him

313
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,200
County Magistrate Yang also went up

314
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,400
also when going up

315
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:45,000
County Magistrate Yang is a county magistrate with very good humanistic qualities

316
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,800
He has been on this island for sixty years

317
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,400
In fact, in 1965, when a large number of our troops went up

318
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,000
In fact he drove that way and said

319
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
In fact it's hard

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
open that road

321
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,300
That chair should have sections cut out

322
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,800
should have appeared then

323
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,500
But until 60 years later

324
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,800
Our county magistrate Yang went up to see

325
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Oops, this is a back seed

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,700
just notify me to investigate

327
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,800
That's why I found this chair

328
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Let's look at the next one

329
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,000
Then the shape of the guide is like this

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,600
That little red dot in the north

331
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,300
near the first position

332
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,500
first position

333
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,200
The port that County Magistrate Yang went to is called Baisheng Port

334
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,700
Baishenggang, the back breed he looked at when he went up

335
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,300
that's the place

336
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,200
Later we saw that it was a chair from the Ming and Qing Dynasties

337
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,000
that hand

338
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,200
let's see the next one

339
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
this is history

340
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,800
we don't know

341
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,400
friend of this guide

342
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,000
say

343
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,580
Mr. Chen Yiyong gave it to me

344
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,720
then it will be difficult

345
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,080
March 1965

346
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:12,280
Only when we officially have a large force can we go up

347
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,800
Just put this army in the emperor

348
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,080
Formal and discreet emperor

349
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,340
That's when I took the second picture

350
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,580
Pay attention to see that the equipment of their troops cannot be compared with today's

351
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,860
it was very very hard

352
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,380
I am in this six years

353
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,140
when i was in the army

354
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,820
It was very hard back then

355
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,860
ok let's see the next one

356
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,180
This is after going up from Baishenggang

357
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,820
This place has a Xiaoliang Pavilion

358
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,940
That is the Ming and Qing Dynasties

359
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,980
In the back that County Magistrate Yang saw

360
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,180
let's see the next one

361
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,020
This is the first time I've been

362
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,400
When I climbed up, I was talking about the fact that there are

363
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
Both have this back phenomenon and back phenomenon

364
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,000
let's see the next one

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
i have a poe

366
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,800
This is the back

367
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
Actually this back

368
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,800
But because there are several floors piled up on the road

369
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,200
not the original

370
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,800
let's see the next one

371
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
When we first went to investigate

372
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
we see this

373
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
This is driving the road

374
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,400
it cuts the section

375
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,400
so i see this

376
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,400
After this back becomes 50 centimeters

377
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,000
30 meters long

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
30 meters long

379
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,600
all terrible

380
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,200
I later I will

381
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,400
Let's go inside it first

382
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
because we all know

383
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,200
so-called back seeding

384
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Ashes may occur because the back becomes

385
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,200
natural disaster

386
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,000
natural

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,720
those climates what death

388
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
may occur

389
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,600
That can't be called being planted

390
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,120
so-called archaeological species

391
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,920
It must be human food waste

392
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,200
throw the husk there

393
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,920
Because there are people in the abdomen

394
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,320
Many of our cultural relics are thrown inside

395
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,880
The broken nets that escaped everywhere were thrown away in there

396
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,680
That's why we call it seeded

397
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,040
we're together we're a team

398
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,240
four of us go up

399
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,240
Let's just say I looked at that pottery

400
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,520
i was startled

401
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,760
Even the sons of Taiwan left without him

402
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,520
looks like

403
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,360
so let's see the next one

404
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,320
The most important thing is that when I investigate

405
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,120
The most important thing is this one of us

406
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,640
Now he is the curator of the Matsu Folklore Cultural and Military Museum

407
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,320
Mr. Pan Jianguo

408
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,920
let's see the next one

409
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,720
Where is he

410
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
As soon as I say we are

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,120
bottom layer

412
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
We all dig a little bit of this back

413
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,920
Cut the peach slices if you can

414
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,320
go back and make specimens

415
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,640
let's check

416
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,720
For example, when he digs the back

417
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,360
He dug up the two sides

418
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,920
Three pieces in total

419
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,120
He showed me he said it was weird

420
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,000
why is this so thin

421
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,160
I can't see it

422
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,080
this is a human skull

423
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,760
so i immediately

424
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,040
I'll hug the plastic bag quickly

425
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,720
I said this place

426
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
cover it up

427
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,840
I will invite the captain of the army

428
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,960
Captain Zhang now has Lieutenant Colonel Shao Xiaosheng

429
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,880
What about him

430
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,520
I said hurry up and try to find a way to make it

431
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,440
this one

432
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,920
You get a plastic sheet or something to cover the bag

433
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,360
I must come to work again

434
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,600
that this is the first time

435
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,560
Bright leads to discovery of human skull

436
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,880
that's how i found it

437
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,600
This, this, curator Pan, is there to pick

438
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
I said I can't pick anymore

439
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,500
just before

440
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
ok let's read the next chapter

441
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,000
Okay, this second story is

442
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,500
On the cliff, the fields are surrounded by flowers

443
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm probably going to tell you about the discovery of this plum group.

444
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,500
Bright Island Blossoms

445
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,000
His cultural background is also Liangdao Neng No. 1 massive brother

446
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I mistakenly called it Brother Hailiang

447
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,500
Maybe Brother Hailiang in the future

448
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,000
How is it better educated than his number one

449
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
maybe more colloquial

450
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Let's see below

451
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Thanks

452
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,000
ok at this point we'll decide

453
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,500
It's cold at this time

454
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,000
it is this time

455
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
it's cold in december

456
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
then we will

457
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,500
This bed is not going

458
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,000
The cot doesn't leave

459
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
very stormy

460
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,500
we must go up

461
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
what to do after that

462
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
county government our county magistrate

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
a lift

464
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,500
This is probably archeology

465
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,000
I am afraid that archeology in Taiwan is the first

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
In summer, I also want to be a senior machine

467
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
this is probably the first time

468
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
this at the airport

469
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Shi Lingguang

470
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Called back now

471
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Shi Lingguang

472
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The director of the battle department is now

473
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Dean of Brigade Students

474
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
he sent us this

475
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We are going to measure

476
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
let's see below

477
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The following is the video

478
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's just say

479
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's take a look

480
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
this our this

481
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
senior machine

482
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
it's been a long time

483
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The video is relatively long, I fried it into

484
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
30 seconds a few seconds

485
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Just look at this guide

486
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
the form is like this

487
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
This is

488
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's this senior aircraft landing pad

489
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
senior airport

490
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There is a road in the middle

491
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
actually the central road

492
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What about the plane?

493
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
When it gets there first it flies around first

494
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
land after one lap

495
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Here's a clip of us sitting on the senior plane

496
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
this is where we are

497
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I just forgot to introduce

498
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,300
We also have members of Liangdao archaeological team here.

499
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,200
Taken by Mr. Yin Yizhi

500
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,200
This amount of island is like this

501
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
just such a small island

502
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,900
very small island

503
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,500
Only 0.37 square kilometers

504
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,500
We are sitting on the senior plane in this plane

505
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
we went first

506
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Now we're slowly descending

507
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,500
don't land

508
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,200
one of the following videos

509
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,800
because when we can

510
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Let's go first and get the full

511
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
where are we going to work

512
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,300
let's test it first

513
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,400
At this time our tool

514
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,800
Only gold luck left

515
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,200
We have nineteen boxes of tools

516
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,800
I packed a family of small fish boats with a scoop

517
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,200
just go up

518
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,600
you can watch it roar

519
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,400
wait a minute to see

520
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,800
This fella Bin

521
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,600
how do they go at this pier

522
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,000
almost every time

523
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Three or two days a scoop boat

524
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,400
one scoop boat a week

525
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,300
His carrier says they all have to work so hard

526
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,800
this pier is

527
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:52,200
The current military light is very, very difficult

528
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,400
the vice captain

529
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,600
The captain without the vice-captain is the leader

530
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,800
The vice-captain is going to fight

531
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,000
to play forward

532
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
all on top

533
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,840
We are affected by the sea less often

534
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,180
in this way

535
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,480
This is our pregnant stuff

536
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
business case

537
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
The second is Mayor Fukushima

538
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,180
David Fukushima

539
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,680
so now

540
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,980
Now the army has to be born first

541
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,980
very hard

542
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,480
This one is wearing black and this one is the vice-captain

543
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,980
Captain was not on the island at that time

544
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Thanks

545
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So go through the plug

546
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
we're afraid things will be missed

547
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
So go through the plug

548
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You can see them all

549
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Here

550
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Here

551
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Here

552
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Here

553
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Here

554
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Here

555
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Here

556
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You can see them all

557
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Fighting against the waves

558
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay, thank you

559
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
let's go on

560
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
ok then we are on the next one

561
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
This is luck

562
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Then when we start going up

563
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Later we were here again

564
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
we found the second place

565
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Third place

566
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,700
Fourth place Third place

567
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,200
We later found four more locations

568
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,700
Of course the first location is the best

569
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,000
is the earliest

570
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,700
second a little later

571
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,200
The second location is more than 7,000 years old

572
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
this is the second place

573
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
The situation at the second location

574
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,200
this can be seen

575
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,800
The back of the city piled here, the back of the master

576
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,400
let's see the next one

577
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,100
This is the so-called backmaster

578
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,000
piled up here

579
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,200
here are some

580
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,400
This is a stone tool

581
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,900
ok let's see the next one

582
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,500
At this time we are digging

583
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,800
So we're on this cliff

584
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,300
only this rope

585
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
Then our rope

586
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,100
who dares to work on it

587
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,200
the military said

588
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,300
All you soldiers, you go up

589
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,500
Just wear a belt around your waist

590
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,600
Hook the hook on this rope lock

591
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,500
I said it's not okay

592
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Neither can our people

593
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,100
Wear a belt every day

594
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,000
what to do

595
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,560
Quickly, the military added three lines to form a net

596
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,360
this is much safer

597
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,160
Then this lady originally Suppose

598
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,500
Shouldn't just wear protective clothing

599
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,600
Because why are you looking for protective clothing?

600
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,160
because we are afraid

601
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,660
This is also our first archeology in Taiwan

602
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,660
We are afraid that when we go to dig up this human bone

603
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,260
we will pollute that

604
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,560
DNA from that skeleton

605
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,520
In the future, DNA will say pollution

606
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,620
inaccurate

607
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,420
For example, if it's my bunny girl

608
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,620
i'm talking now

609
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,560
Running out is someone Chen's DNA

610
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,720
no joke

611
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,720
right

612
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,020
So we prepared 20 sets of protective clothing

613
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,020
It's so cold that the temperature is only 6 degrees to 8 degrees

614
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,620
Digging on this side of this cliff

615
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
unbearably cold

616
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,360
So put on a set of protective clothing first

617
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,420
this is such a story

618
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,980
Then we'll have to plug all the lone walkers we dug up.

619
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
our measurement

620
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
field survey

621
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
this

622
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
this hot pit

623
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
our location

624
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
it's all on a cliff

625
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
so the topic

626
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
This is not an exaggeration at all

627
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Considerations on the cliff

628
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
ok let's see what happens next

629
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
well this is our job

630
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
If this man's skull is dug here

631
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
let's go first

632
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
save it here first

633
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Others are pitting us

634
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
main hope not to be shattered

635
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
broken edge

636
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So we dig like this

637
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Layer by layer

638
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
This pit is dug layer by layer

639
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
dug out

640
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
stuff up no matter what

641
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Apple stuffed

642
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
let's see what happens next

643
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Well, of course there is a lot of congestion.

644
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
We have to pick things out

645
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
After the things are picked out, they need to be classified

646
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
still have to take

647
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
go to that

648
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
support weight

649
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
wrap up

650
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
this is me

651
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I have to work too

652
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
well watch the next one

653
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is unearthed pottery

654
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,600
Many of these pottery pieces are scientific and cultural

655
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,600
Of course there are many of them and Zi Jiawen

656
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Violet Gavin

657
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
according to these things

658
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,200
and this cabbage

659
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,000
so a little bit

660
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,400
So it's Kushidai only from

661
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,200
probably at the earliest

662
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Because our strata did the first time Taiwan University did it in 7900

663
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,100
the earliest should be

664
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,600
This formation is 7900 years old

665
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,400
But the human bones are under this layer

666
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,600
So it's earlier 8300 to 8000 a

667
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,200
such a formation

668
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,200
Then the above point is about 7500

669
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
This stratum is like this

670
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
let's look at the next level

671
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,700
This is the lover of its pottery

672
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,500
its sherds

673
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,300
this is a harpoon

674
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,700
What about the harpoon?

675
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,800
it this harpoon is a thrown harpoon

676
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
after throwing it out

677
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
There's a small harpoon in the back

678
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
this rope

679
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,700
Most are broken

680
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,500
why?

681
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,200
the fish broke

682
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,200
the rest of the head

683
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,700
we can see below

684
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
This is a complete harpoon

685
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
In our Yangxian long special preference

686
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
We will hold the national treasure in the future

687
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,500
Qingnian

688
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,200
chicken vertebrae of this fish

689
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
bone

690
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,000
bone needle

691
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,200
let's see below

692
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Its stone tools are more primitive

693
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,200
In fact, the traces of typing are not very clear.

694
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Mostly sourced locally

695
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Because why do we call it a stone tool

696
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,200
because it has this tall trace

697
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,700
through usable stone

698
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,800
To become a stone tool

699
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
what can be made

700
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,300
To become a stone tool

701
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,100
this blade cloth

702
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,200
Damaged loss by all use

703
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,200
let's see below

704
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,100
Thanks

705
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,160
At this time, we discovered that we found here

706
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,540
we keep it covered

707
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,000
we keep this piece

708
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,300
At this time we have a thought

709
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,000
just don't know

710
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,540
i know the human skull is in this place

711
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,340
After all, the human body was dug out

712
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,500
has been dug up

713
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Still hiding in this stick

714
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,240
So let's just keep this one

715
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,840
After the above is cleaned up

716
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Let's get back to the stick problem

717
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
So I slowly cleared up this part

718
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,340
let's see below

719
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Clear it out and dig it down slowly

720
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,340
It's such a level

721
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,040
It turns out that reproduction is inside

722
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,540
it's the rod of exorcism

723
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,840
I have another story to tell at this point

724
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,340
because we found out later

725
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,640
I will ask

726
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,140
Friends of Fuguo Bingyu

727
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Do you have any I want to hear their stories

728
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,200
An instructor who is still in Huanian High School

729
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Lieutenant Colonel Qin Huaian

730
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,600
He said that long ago his Abbiers kissed the head of the side

731
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,800
once dug up the human bones of three sentences

732
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,600
Two sentences are for adults and one sentence is for children and babies

733
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
An adult kneels like this

734
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,400
He suspected that at that time it was probably the old Communist

735
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,400
So those people are kneeling and pushed into the sea

736
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,900
So this is destined, chairman

737
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,200
Do you think if he found out then

738
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Then it won't be our turn

739
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,400
Such

740
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,300
good

741
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,600
Then when we dig out this curiosity

742
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,900
I will delete it with our team

743
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,200
I said it's so cold

744
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,700
If this thing is cleared up now

745
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,300
all each

746
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The bones must be broken and broken, and so early

747
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I said we better ship it back

748
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,300
this can't move now

749
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
And once this is cleared up

750
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
able to flash

751
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,000
There is no way to look like you can

752
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,500
there's no way you can't fight back

753
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,600
OK, we decided to dig

754
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,400
So just dig a piece

755
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,500
wrap it up

756
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,700
After wrapping it up we dig

757
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,000
Dig a piece and transport it back to Nangan

758
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,700
Folklore Museum to deal with slowly

759
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,100
let's see the next one

760
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,700
this time is very difficult

761
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,800
except outside digging at the bottom

762
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,300
You have to dig out the set list first and put it in first.

763
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,500
to be able to drag the whole thing out

764
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,500
So we wrap it tight and just do it

765
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
Pull it out and put it in the box later

766
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,500
transport it back to nangan

767
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
let's take a look

768
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Zhuanxiang

769
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,780
Oh, this boat came back to Nangang

770
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,580
just shipped it back

771
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,880
ok let's see below

772
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,700
Oh, this is about the third

773
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,580
This Liangdao man

774
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,380
Fortunately, Brother Hailiang belongs to Heshui people

775
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,780
his age

776
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,240
how do we guess

777
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,700
Just pull his sleeping rib

778
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,500
make carbon stone firm

779
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
So guess it is

780
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,040
He is the BG of plus or minus 40 years in 738

781
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,740
His because of correction

782
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,140
All carbon stones must be calibrated

783
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,340
The correction result is 8320 to 8060

784
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,340
BP on B4 Pleasant

785
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
is huge gold

786
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
is modern

787
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,540
Ten years old is around 8300 to 8300

788
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,540
His inspection of us. This is the third paragraph we are going to talk about.

789
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,240
ok, let's see

790
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Oh, this one is back at the Matsu Literary and Art Museum

791
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,740
let's see next

792
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,740
his clean up

793
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,340
let's see below

794
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
this time we start

795
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
just find another team

796
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,200
As for Dr. Qiu Honglin from the Institute of Anthropology of Tsinghua University

797
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,800
he is an assistant professor

798
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,400
He came to clean the bone

799
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,200
he slowly cleans up

800
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,600
I rented this dirt and slowly peeled it off

801
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,200
ok let's see the next one

802
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,300
This is what it looks like when you peel it off

803
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,600
It's all a phenomenon of driving obstacles

804
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,200
let's see the next one

805
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,800
At this time we are going to take pictures and draw pictures

806
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,400
it is like this

807
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,200
Now, we

808
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
we are talking about

809
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
let's see next

810
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,600
The picture drawn is like this

811
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,500
This is the picture of the car

812
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,800
let's see below

813
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
its probably male

814
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
Number 1 is male

815
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,600
Around 30 years old

816
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
go outside without armor

817
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
no coffin

818
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,800
What about the possession? I didn't find it.

819
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,000
Up to the first time

820
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,900
each piece is so big

821
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
History of the 20 cm diameter

822
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,600
it's interesting

823
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,400
Because not long ago we were in

824
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,400
hold an international seminar

825
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,800
An archaeologist from Vietnam came

826
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,800
he reports

827
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,300
from their place

828
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,600
There are also a group of district executives

829
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,100
But much more than our time

830
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,100
He said they had a piece of history on their rods

831
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
There's a piece of history all over it

832
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,500
so is there some connection

833
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,300
we are still doing research

834
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
what about this person

835
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
He is not a secondary account for the primary account

836
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,000
lump sum

837
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,600
the overall performance

838
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,500
Mouth ancient ah

839
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,900
Everything in this world is more flowery

840
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,100
Spade-shaped incisors are characteristic of Mongolians

841
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,500
in this way

842
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,900
Then he probably because of his dead ancient cut collection

843
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,100
deeper angle

844
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,500
He was identified as male Xu Zhizhan

845
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,040
probably like this

846
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
let's see the next one

847
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,300
There's some left

848
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,840
Height is about 160 or so

849
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,300
That

850
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,400
It looks like 158, 160

851
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,500
so not very tall

852
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,300
and some diseases

853
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
let's see the next one

854
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,900
he marked this

855
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
The bones are thicker

856
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,400
look at the next one

857
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,200
he has this

858
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
spine

859
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,700
have this arthritis problem

860
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
look at the next one

861
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,200
that has arthritis

862
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,900
look at the next one

863
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,200
his teeth

864
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,800
This has

865
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,000
just bite

866
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
very that

867
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,300
Fragrance is very powerful

868
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
Eat well

869
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
This can be seen

870
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
look at the next one

871
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
and ears

872
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
What is the ear type like?

873
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm looking at the next one

874
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
modern man

875
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Filling people's ears

876
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Hello E.

877
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Japanese and Korean divers

878
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Those who often dig their backs

879
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
divers

880
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
will have this problem

881
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It can be seen that she is often active there

882
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
let's see the next one

883
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
when this is done

884
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The result of the repair is like this

885
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
very important point

886
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
We're going to do 3D image scanning

887
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
This is the Cultural Resources Bureau of the Ministry of Culture

888
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Cultural Groups in Tainan

889
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
one of its teams came in

890
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Why not to do 3D scanning

891
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
because what i just said

892
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
If we take all the bones

893
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
After opening the glass

894
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
you can't fight back

895
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Current Technology 3D Scanning

896
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's you who made it to this extent

897
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I would like to 3D scan after

898
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,500
It will be like a printer in the future

899
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Will restore it back later

900
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,000
just make a model

901
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
rely on this set of technology

902
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,500
So we also made this set of techniques

903
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,000
let's see the next one

904
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,000
I forgot to say just now

905
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,500
all the dots

906
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
It's their 3D scanning of this layout

907
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,000
later it will be corrected when

908
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,500
Rely on this point to correct

909
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
because you transform

910
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,000
Sometimes this angle and so on will be deformed

911
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,500
it may depend on this drug to correct

912
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
now let's see the next one

913
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
The case of this 3D scan

914
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,500
Do another 3D scan

915
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
look at the next one

916
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
This 3D scan means

917
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
What I just said is mainly

918
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,000
Reconstructing the circumstances of the burial

919
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,500
while doing

920
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
let's see the next one

921
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The fourth story is

922
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Big brother

923
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
The Discovery of Massive Girls in "Liangdaoren 2"

924
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,680
this has many stories

925
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,160
many stories

926
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,840
roughly like this

927
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,080
its discovery was providence

928
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,440
this is what we are all going to talk about

929
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,640
how old is it

930
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,200
Almost 7500-750

931
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,520
This is very accurate

932
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,560
This carbon word is very accurate

933
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,000
this object

934
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,240
The material difference in the middle is only 30 years

935
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,360
rather accurate

936
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Massive girls unearthed suffered setbacks

937
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,720
She used to be innocent

938
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,240
A survey of institutional anthropology

939
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
let's see the next one

940
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,960
Why is it God's will to say this?

941
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,160
when we decided

942
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,560
When the position of the draped pit is determined

943
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,520
We have two different opinions on the team

944
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,640
One opinion is that

945
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,760
30 meters long from this long

946
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,760
Don't focus too much on here

947
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,160
you should hit a place where you lose a little

948
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,200
Then my opinion is don't go too far

949
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,560
Because this place is the last

950
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,960
thicker words

951
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,860
We may have more things

952
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,760
There are more piles

953
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,460
that's a compromise

954
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,360
As a result, I was 1 meter away from it

955
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,920
1 meter distance 1 meter

956
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,120
this is a point

957
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,520
let's see the next stop

958
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,420
then we have a little more

959
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,720
back to the front

960
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,920
sorry we talked

961
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,120
still think about it

962
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,120
i think it should be this

963
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,160
We were originally 1 meter wide

964
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,820
I should be 1 meter 2

965
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,120
because step aside

966
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,220
But this side will be a little wider

967
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,760
So I think the bigger

968
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,920
the bigger the better

969
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,920
So add 20 centimeters to the next stop

970
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
come out the result

971
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
yes i didn't show off

972
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,500
we dug this hole

973
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,000
It turned out to be here

974
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes look at this position

975
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
This came out later

976
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
We originally dug the hole here

977
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's almost the end of the digging.

978
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,500
when it's almost over

979
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,000
we are on our feet

980
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
its lacquer bone was found

981
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So I know that the pit is here

982
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
If this place is not clean

983
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
ignore the paintbone

984
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
won't find it either

985
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Later we dug after the painted bone

986
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
we expand

987
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I think it should expand from here

988
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
That's why I roughly merged them together.

989
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
This No. 2 pit looks like this

990
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Number two, that's how the second child found out.

991
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
still so easy

992
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
what we found

993
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,840
If it's us, we won't fight

994
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,960
Wolves won't notice it at all

995
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,920
And if we don't expand a little bit by 20 centimeters

996
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,680
can't find it either

997
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,640
This is a very fortunate thing

998
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,320
ok let's see the next one

999
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,240
alright

1000
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,600
The chairman may now find out

1001
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,880
There is something wrong with this picture

1002
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,160
what is the problem

1003
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,880
its head

1004
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,680
even the bones are gone

1005
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,280
this is a story

1006
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,360
Our county magistrate yang is coming

1007
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,120
he will do

1008
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,280
he wants to sigh

1009
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:42,800
why

1010
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,440
because we were

1011
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
when we dig

1012
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,960
Because there was a typhoon at that time

1013
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,000
And our teacher Qiu has a class in Tsinghua University

1014
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,280
he has no time

1015
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,760
let's share

1016
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,000
can't finish this

1017
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,840
So we found this eyeball

1018
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,720
what is this eye socket

1019
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,600
probably this person looks like

1020
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,960
The leg bones look like a little model

1021
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,280
We thought we shouldn't dig anymore

1022
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,360
stop today

1023
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,620
we'll come back next time

1024
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,480
Do it carefully, there is no time

1025
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,880
another typhoon

1026
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,280
Let's smoke it back part of the way

1027
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,560
Ma Dong, cover, cover, cover.

1028
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,520
When we went back last four weeks

1029
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,080
when we started digging

1030
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,360
Oops

1031
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,800
All the bones are gone

1032
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,320
At this time I am very anxious

1033
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,760
how do i explain

1034
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,240
Because everyone can see clearly

1035
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,280
this is heartbreaking

1036
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,800
this is not the old look

1037
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,880
how to explain this

1038
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,600
very urgent

1039
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,400
that's when we thought

1040
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,560
there are three possibilities

1041
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,320
a man from the sea

1042
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,000
One is to bring an occasional person on the island from time to time

1043
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,200
The third kind of friendship is that it must be a person who is resident on the island.

1044
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,500
There is only Brother Bing on that island

1045
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,500
So we make judgments on the spot

1046
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,200
He said it must be from the island

1047
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,900
Do not consider the first two of the three

1048
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,500
people from this island

1049
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,500
Because of this, I told the county magistrate

1050
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:39,000
I said if you change the range from that big

1051
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,500
at sea because we were digging

1052
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,000
Wearing yellow trousers and changing in vain

1053
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
People who assume that the sea is the opposite shore must be curious

1054
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't know what the hell you're up to, let's go up and see

1055
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
this is our speculation

1056
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's impossible for us to say on the spot

1057
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
must be from the island

1058
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,300
Since I live on the island a lot, we know

1059
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,300
Harbin and the officers are busy with his business all day and night

1060
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:16,300
There is no time left to kill our specimens

1061
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:23,500
And how can we pull out our face teeth

1062
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,500
This is not a medical staff, not familiar with medical treatment

1063
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,500
People who are familiar with the structure of this human body will only do this kind of thing

1064
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:41,500
We use his on the spot

1065
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
I know, I know

1066
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,500
Then he found it

1067
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
found out

1068
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,500
things are guaranteed

1069
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,500
But right now because this is a military guy

1070
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:57,500
Still in scouting phase

1071
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
I can't tell more about his story

1072
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,120
All in all, we got him back as Omi-head

1073
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,360
I only have face to face today

1074
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,320
I have the face to say this today

1075
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
Otherwise I wouldn't be able to do this

1076
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,220
I can't explain this

1077
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:17,320
This is a very interesting story

1078
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,480
a story

1079
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,560
found it

1080
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,080
Like this, let's see the next one

1081
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,680
Probably because of this gender

1082
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,240
It was because it hadn't been cleaned up at that time.

1083
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,880
preliminary resistance

1084
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,480
I thought it was difficult

1085
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,080
It was difficult for us to announce the first time

1086
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,280
Then slowly clean him up

1087
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,080
Plus DNA sent to Germany

1088
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,480
Because the Germans have these two sentences of DNA

1089
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,880
The back skirt of the mitochondria

1090
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
all appeared

1091
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
number one is one

1092
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I will say later that the second number is 29

1093
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
all appeared

1094
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Because both sentences are difficult

1095
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We just want to be a Y chromosome

1096
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Y Narsity DNA減定

1097
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
As a result, the Germans were number one

1098
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
do have

1099
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
His DNA has been extracted

1100
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But the second number can't be drawn no matter what

1101
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
He later tested him and said he was female

1102
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
can't be a man

1103
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Later, we consider institutional man as

1104
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
The result of this careful examination

1105
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
indeed a woman

1106
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So number two we

1107
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Correction is female

1108
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
ok let's see below

1109
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
And he had a baby

1110
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
that lady

1111
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Then the case of number two

1112
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
He has another one here

1113
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
The stone ball stepped on his feet

1114
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't know if it makes sense

1115
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
do not know either

1116
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
look at the next one

1117
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Fu Yuancheng

1118
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
this is really hateful

1119
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,000
Great Faith of Disbelief

1120
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,500
We are still so complete

1121
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,000
its integrity

1122
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,500
The physical integrity of the entire number two is 85% to 90%

1123
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,000
this is machine difficulty

1124
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,300
it is 7500

1125
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,500
Although it is 7500 years

1126
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,000
but still so complete

1127
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
this is machine difficulty

1128
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,500
so very happy

1129
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,000
Thanks

1130
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
look at the next one

1131
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,500
This is the comparison of No. 1 and No. 2

1132
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,500
you see the face is a little different

1133
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,000
the face is a little different

1134
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
look at the next one

1135
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,500
these two groups

1136
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,000
Roughly speaking in the group

1137
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,500
it's very similar

1138
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,000
so it should

1139
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
this is

1140
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
is a regional person

1141
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
On the other hand, number one is male

1142
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,400
number two is female

1143
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,400
His face also shows his difference

1144
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,900
The third is that age is the same

1145
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,900
Individuals who are all around 30 years old

1146
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,600
height or model situation

1147
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,400
he also has some differences

1148
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,300
because of this aspect

1149
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,700
Today I also have some friends in molecular biology

1150
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,300
I am a layman

1151
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,900
to teach directly

1152
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,900
Please teach directly

1153
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,300
let's see the next one

1154
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,800
The comparison of these two sentences is

1155
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,300
Of course number one and number two are men

1156
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,600
one is female

1157
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,500
one time at a time

1158
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,700
he didn't

1159
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,000
are all pits

1160
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,200
none occupied

1161
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,000
no coffin

1162
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,400
Occupy and no soil hole

1163
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,900
he is the group

1164
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,300
Health group

1165
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,900
group like left car

1166
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,000
One is Naozhi

1167
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,100
two are straight

1168
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
towards the east

1169
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
facing one to the left and one to the right

1170
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
No training items

1171
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
He has the poetry hammer just mentioned.

1172
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Then there is a piece of what I just mentioned

1173
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Is this a sign

1174
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
we are still doing research here

1175
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
What about number two?

1176
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
It's a fire pit phenomenon

1177
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
What is the Huotang Phenomenon?

1178
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
there are people from before us

1179
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
used to live here

1180
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
fire pit and live things

1181
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
was on that spot

1182
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'll be angry later

1183
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
over there in the garbage dump

1184
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
ok let's see the next one

1185
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The results of the DNA analysis

1186
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
that's because

1187
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
it's all

1188
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Approaching the modern Austronesian universe

1189
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
This Hanshi seat

1190
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
It is similar to the South Island universe

1191
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
high degree of similarity

1192
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
If the second analysis is reliable

1193
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Daoist Liang may be

1194
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
linguist preliminary design

1195
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
6000 years ago

1196
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Before the Nandao Yu Clan started phase expansion

1197
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Daoyu Ethnic Group Living in Yuannan, Southeast China

1198
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
The result is

1199
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Because its number one is 10,000 to 10,000 haplogroups

1200
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
The second number is haplogroup 290

1201
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
It is similar to modern Taiwan, Yuanzhou, America, Philippines

1202
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Indonesia, whole Luogang, Southeast Asia

1203
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:43,000
The Daoyu ethnic group has a matrilineal blood relationship

1204
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
But now the ethnic groups in the southeast of mainland China

1205
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
very far from them

1206
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
let's see the next one

1207
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
This is what I am very cautious about

1208
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Because in fact the identification of carbon current events

1209
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
We have also done a lot in Taiwan

1210
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,740
This experience is also very rich

1211
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:08,240
For example, National Taiwan University has Guijunshu Experimental Center

1212
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,000
we first started

1213
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,740
We send him to do whatever we carry

1214
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,540
very accurate

1215
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,340
It's all his 7900

1216
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,240
that's on his upper floor

1217
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,000
So it's all right

1218
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,840
But I'm cautious

1219
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,340
We can share the beta that I sent to the United States

1220
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,940
That is a very well-known international geography of carbon essence

1221
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:32,280
So there's nothing wrong with taking his own ribs

1222
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,080
Because his own bones are made of carbon substance

1223
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,180
The result is

1224
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,340
This is 8320

1225
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,980
What I just talked about goes all the way to 8160

1226
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,180
two sigma

1227
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,280
Two data come out

1228
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,480
You can go to 806

1229
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
this is

1230
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,480
that's right

1231
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,840
this is the sentence

1232
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,480
I am making an example

1233
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,720
our later

1234
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,720
Energy stock

1235
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The ancient DNA and some artifacts are given to Beta to make

1236
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,200
although it is expensive

1237
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,700
One costs more than 10,000 Taiwan dollars

1238
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,800
our next one

1239
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,500
This is what we have to do with this

1240
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,000
XIV and carbon XIV representatives

1241
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,600
For example, Inao

1242
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,300
The first point is to say the first place

1243
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,600
The second place The second place is between 7600 and 7500

1244
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,700
So much data in the first place

1245
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,600
this is nogu

1246
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,700
this is nogu

1247
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,800
two years old

1248
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,800
Its culture has reached seventy-nine

1249
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,600
almost seven thousand years

1250
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:44,000
Minmin Harbor is from 1638 to 1852 A.D.

1251
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
this is the age

1252
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,600
let's see the next one

1253
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Then we will talk about the fifth paragraph of the story.

1254
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,800
The fifth story is very important is the study of DNA

1255
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,700
dna research

1256
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,100
we were

1257
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,200
My idea is how we should encourage our own domestic research teams

1258
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,000
I hope to find a partner in China

1259
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,200
But then I inquired about the result

1260
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:20,200
The success rate of domestic partners is not high, about one-tenth

1261
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,600
Send ten to make one

1262
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,300
They doubt everything about his accuracy

1263
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,100
I was thinking that we only had this sentence, then there was only number one

1264
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,300
what to do

1265
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,100
1 out of 10 this can't risk these

1266
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,300
I will listen more

1267
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,800
that's very lucky

1268
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,900
This is my colleague, Academician Zhang Zhenghua

1269
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,500
He happened to be with Germany's Max Plan

1270
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,800
With Professor He Yingqing, the vice president of Kaohsiung Medical University at that time

1271
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,800
he is in contact with him

1272
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:00,300
Another day I called him and asked about the domestic DNA

1273
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,440
Because he said this for a long time, tomorrow, Principal Ge will take his son

1274
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It is his son, President Ge’s son, Mr. Ge Mingxuan, who is a doctoral student at Max Plan in Germany

1275
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,400
I'm about to graduate now, and I happen to be a doctoral student there.

1276
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,200
He also made Taiwan's DNA of Taiwan's aborigines

1277
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:26,200
I think this opportunity is too rare for me, so I hurried to Tainan to meet them

1278
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:32,000
Once they are of course more interested in the 8000+ years

1279
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,400
Because there are more specimens in Nanke, he has 2000 sentences

1280
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,000
But South Kota's earliest is 4800

1281
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,400
Of course he is most interested in the earliest us of more than 8,000 years

1282
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,600
so take priority

1283
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:54,000
This Max Plan, this location is world famous

1284
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,400
Let's see the next one now

1285
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,900
I'll talk about us later

1286
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,600
Follow Principal Ge, Vice Principal Ge

1287
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,800
He is now the president and vice president of China Medical University

1288
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,400
This Professor Gu Yinqing, I am with them.

1289
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,400
His wife accompanied us to Germany

1290
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Send my sample to this institute in person

1291
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,600
let's see the next one

1292
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,600
This is the Stone King Professor Stone King

1293
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,200
He is their director

1294
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,800
This and that ethnography this crew

1295
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,800
This is the vice principal's son

1296
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,800
and his team

1297
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,200
then i go for the first time

1298
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,800
Of course I'm going to do a briefing

1299
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,000
Do a briefing with them for a photo shoot

1300
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,000
But now I want to introduce this Stone King in particular

1301
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,500
our partners

1302
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,000
He's just waiting for what I'm going to say

1303
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,800
this is who we are now

1304
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,400
our current race

1305
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,360
Not at all Homo Sapiens Sapiens

1306
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,560
Homo sapiens sapiens

1307
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,520
His theory is out of Africa

1308
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:16,960
That is, his ancestors changed from Elsang to Africa

1309
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,400
Follow M and N

1310
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,600
The theory out of Africa

1311
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,560
He was published by Professor Stone King and his teacher

1312
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,480
Now no one doubts his academic

1313
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,200
Because the race is very...

1314
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:38,240
This science is that everyone is very...

1315
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,080
That is to say, between them

1316
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,440
It's all very clear

1317
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,200
So he is a very important scholar who came up with African theory

1318
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,160
so we're glad he's working with us

1319
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,360
and his son

1320
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,160
This lady is surnamed Fu

1321
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,440
Fu Qiaomei

1322
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,480
Ms. is mainland China

1323
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,600
Graduate students in Beijing

1324
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,440
He is now a graduate

1325
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,600
If the distance is low, pull it to Harvard University and grab it immediately

1326
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,800
snatch him away

1327
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,240
now at harvard

1328
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,040
So he is the master of our DNA extraction

1329
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,440
he did it all

1330
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,600
he arrived last christmas

1331
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,700
he won't go back to beijing

1332
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,400
He said I dedicated my tribute to your DNA

1333
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,100
yes do this

1334
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,400
ok let's see the next one now

1335
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,240
At this time, I put this sample

1336
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,740
In the beginning he asked for a leg bone

1337
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:34,540
this straight bone

1338
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,040
this tooth

1339
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,040
Three things to send to the deputy doctor

1340
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:43,740
he accepts our specimens

1341
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,740
let's see the next one

1342
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,440
good

1343
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,640
The result of his analysis is

1344
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,640
this we just saw

1345
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,340
said he was

1346
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,640
one is 1

1347
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,440
Number one is the 10,000 to 10,000 haplogroup

1348
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,940
Haplogroups, let me explain a bit more

1349
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
So haplogroups are Multiconscience

1350
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
The Hypergroup

1351
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's because of the DNA in our body

1352
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Each DNA trap has 23 pairs of blue bodies

1353
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
23 pairs inside

1354
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
22 pairs are all XX

1355
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Only one pair is XY

1356
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Only the blue sex can have the appearance of Y

1357
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
If it is female, it is still XX

1358
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
so in other words

1359
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Inside each set of DNA

1360
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
23 pairs of blue body inside

1361
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
45/46 is X

1362
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
1/46 of only one blue sex is Y

1363
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So 1 is also in other words

1364
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
it is more

1365
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,600
So it's easier for him to do

1366
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,800
So first make it like this

1367
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,600
The second sentence is the R9 haplogroup

1368
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,900
From these two sentences

1369
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,100
He is with R1 and R9

1370
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:19,900
They are all related to Taiwanese aboriginal returning soldiers with matrilineal blood relationship

1371
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,800
but how much

1372
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,700
There are very few people in mainland China

1373
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,000
let's see the next one

1374
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,800
This is the L3 just mentioned

1375
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,900
When the M comes out

1376
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,600
N is mainly

1377
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,400
Most of Europe is N

1378
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,200
M go from here

1379
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,700
I have always been in mainland China

1380
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,100
Then M looks like this

1381
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,000
There are also parts of N that go to the coastline very early

1382
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,100
all the way to australia

1383
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,900
Then the M branch goes all the way to America

1384
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:57,300
let's see the next one

1385
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,000
Our E is here

1386
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,160
That is when M came out and Tuhuizhou came out and developed to this generation of M9.

1387
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:11,560
M9 comes out of D probably in this place

1388
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,760
So sentence D is this group

1389
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:18,460
The second sentence we have to see the next one

1390
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,960
The second sentence is N becomes R

1391
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,460
R9 is in this place

1392
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:29,560
It is this generation that is Tibet, the generation of Izzy Indochina Peninsula

1393
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,560
I am also a layman

1394
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,960
so please advise

1395
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,460
Thank you, let's look at the next question

1396
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:43,160
This is from L3 from here on M

1397
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,860
We E are this group

1398
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,860
So R9 is the N group

1399
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:51,060
to this group

1400
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,560
Let's look at the next question

1401
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,160
this what i'm going to talk about now

1402
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,560
this

1403
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,960
epilogue

1404
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,500
Well, since this Liangdao man was unearthed

1405
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,500
we are discussing now

1406
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,500
what problems did he cause

1407
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,500
this is my personal opinion

1408
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,500
there are nine questions

1409
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:19,500
The first is to reinforce the theme of the ocean in ancient China

1410
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
how do you say that

1411
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Just because China includes Taiwan

1412
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,000
At the earliest, all historians focused on the Central Plains

1413
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
study that place

1414
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
The regions on our frontier seem to be understudied

1415
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
very few

1416
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,000
This is the difference between a mainstream and some fringe research

1417
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
In fact, people from Liangdao more than 8,000 years ago

1418
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
he is at sea

1419
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
We can know that

1420
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,000
In fact, it was very early on the edge of the continent in East Asia

1421
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
early

1422
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Sea nations have been active for a long time

1423
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,800
This is what we have been ignoring before

1424
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,500
Then this year

1425
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:09,500
From 2030

1426
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,500
already started now

1427
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,300
Many of us have started to notice this

1428
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,300
aspects like archeology

1429
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,700
archeology too

1430
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:25,000
Because it used to be dominated by the Central Plains

1431
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Everything Central Plains

1432
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,500
even our predecessors

1433
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,000
our teachers

1434
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,500
Mr. Zhang Guangzhi

1435
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
His research is still in the Central Plains

1436
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,200
For example, his Longshan Luowei

1437
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
second category

1438
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,700
It is the school during the trip to Yongsan

1439
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,000
He is from Longshan Culture

1440
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,700
This coastal generation is all descended from the Longshan travel period.

1441
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:58,700
And then until the 1980s

1442
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,700
start

1443
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,900
In the history of China, there were mainland scholars with strange book handles.

1444
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:07,400
He thinks Chinese history is not like this

1445
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,300
He broke the concept

1446
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:15,200
Think that there should be six cultural regions in Chinese history

1447
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,100
There are six cultural districts in Geju Frontier

1448
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:23,100
In fact, the six cultural districts were all developed at the same time

1449
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,100
Later, slowly because the Central Plains culture is too strong

1450
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,300
too powerful

1451
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,900
So slowly contact more and more

1452
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,000
contact them

1453
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,600
you just know something

1454
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,400
this is mr book handle

1455
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,700
Of course, our Mr. Zhang Guangzhi also later

1456
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,600
Because this trend also has some changes

1457
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,200
so I always just because

1458
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:51,000
Later, when I did research on marine guide reputation for me,

1459
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,500
I feel that these ethnic groups should have been earlier

1460
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,800
It's not because they've been around the coast for a long time

1461
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
float around, walk around, walk around

1462
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,800
So the inland culture is completely different from the ocean culture

1463
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,800
concept is different

1464
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Because the inland cultures are enclosed in one piece

1465
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,400
its resource is the land

1466
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,000
So everyone has to tell the truth and I will talk more.

1467
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,600
the ocean is not

1468
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,200
The ocean because the sky outside them is too wide

1469
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,000
so they are drifting

1470
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
relatively large liquidity

1471
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
This is their characteristic is that they are different from the inland

1472
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
and their inland culture

1473
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Because the resources are there

1474
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
they are ac

1475
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Foreign exchanges have long existed

1476
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
have been communicating with each other for a long time

1477
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So oceanic culture

1478
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And inland culture

1479
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It slowly develops into steak

1480
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
nation

1481
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Nation into country

1482
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,160
Because it wants to govern the oceanic nation of this land

1483
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,760
Not easy to become State

1484
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,320
it's not easy

1485
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,560
because it's inherently fluid

1486
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,640
I'm not very good at staying in a certain place

1487
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,360
how will it develop

1488
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,160
looking at the land

1489
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,040
big no

1490
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,720
So Oceanic Networks

1491
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,200
like us in taiwan

1492
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,320
why such a big island

1493
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:31,520
is there any country

1494
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,360
no since ancient times

1495
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:37,240
We arrived at the Han people a little earlier than Zheng Chenggong

1496
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,320
It is now more than four hundred years ago

1497
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,400
when come

1498
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,480
Taiwan is still mostly aborigines

1499
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,720
many tribes

1500
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,160
come here to live together

1501
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,080
it lives here

1502
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,960
It is not easy to become State

1503
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,080
This is where the ocean is different

1504
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,320
So I think it's time to be afraid

1505
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,920
ocean population

1506
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Research on this aspect must be strengthened

1507
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:04,600
the second

1508
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,900
Of course, because we studied

1509
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,100
The prehistoric cultural sequence along the Mijiang coast

1510
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,300
Their earliest was Ke Qiutou

1511
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,900
Fujian Pingtang

1512
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,700
Ke Qiu voted that his age would not exceed seven thousand years

1513
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,800
Now if we assume Liangdao people

1514
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,300
This is eight thousand and seven thousand words

1515
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,600
to break their sequence

1516
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,100
I'm afraid to be in their

1517
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,500
This Liangdao culture was earlier than them

1518
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,800
this is the third

1519
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,300
Chronology of divergence of the origin of the Austronesian universe

1520
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,100
because

1521
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,700
The main committee may understand

1522
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,500
so-called universe

1523
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,600
because the universe's two

1524
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:50,700
how is the universe

1525
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,100
I tell you something in common

1526
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,800
i can communicate

1527
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,200
such a group

1528
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,600
such a group

1529
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,900
But it doesn't mean

1530
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Bloodborne is the bloodline of the unified race

1531
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:04,440
at this point

1532
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,760
so we can see

1533
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:11,480
You can tell from the two sentences of Liangdao

1534
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,880
One sentence is one one

1535
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,360
One sentence is twenty nine

1536
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,360
where did twenty nine come from

1537
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:17,440
what i just said

1538
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,760
it is from indochina peninsula from burma

1539
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,920
Inner Belt of Tibet and Burma

1540
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,520
Exhibition to Indochina Peninsula

1541
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,360
Just arrived in the southern ocean area

1542
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:35,920
One is from the M9 in Mainland China

1543
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,560
It turned out to be in this area

1544
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,720
So to express two sentences we found

1545
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,720
already two different groups

1546
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,160
You can see that the sea peoples in our ancient area

1547
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,480
How divided is his ethnic group

1548
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,960
How many different ethnic groups does he have

1549
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,760
So this is his age division

1550
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,800
wide open

1551
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,040
Because the South Island has

1552
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,400
Now, for example, the academician Lirengui of our academy

1553
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:10,800
They kept pushing and pushing until maybe six thousand years

1554
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,900
I saw it the other day

1555
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:18,100
Did Lan Daoyu dare not say six thousand years ago?

1556
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,900
he thinks not

1557
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,600
he thinks not

1558
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:27,100
Recently, I was at Connel University with Mr. Mei Zhulin

1559
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,900
He recently corresponded with him

1560
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,800
on these issues

1561
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,800
that is

1562
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,000
should they linguists because they think

1563
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,700
Blue Sword Feather is

1564
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:44,300
It is generally believed to be branched from Bluetooth

1565
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,700
but

1566
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,600
When their blue sword feather appeared

1567
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,100
is already a full-fledged language

1568
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,700
So they all think that there should be a language

1569
01:11:55,700 --> 01:12:00,100
It is gradually used from Bluetooth to Blue Daoyu

1570
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
have a status

1571
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,740
maybe this is

1572
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,540
linguists to study

1573
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,700
not us archaeologists

1574
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,700
so-called research questions

1575
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,700
This is

1576
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,500
So the linguist actually asks

1577
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:14,800
differentiation problem

1578
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,900
Probably know

1579
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,800
Because when Taiwan split up

1580
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,200
It's only about 4,000 to 5,000 years old

1581
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,800
Li Dover

1582
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,000
not more than six thousand years

1583
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,700
So this age of differentiation is like this

1584
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,700
So

1585
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,500
South Island and Bamboo

1586
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:35,500
actually when

1587
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,500
this

1588
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,500
This is their linguist

1589
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,500
probably place to try again later

1590
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,500
That

1591
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,500
generally believed

1592
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,900
East Asia is the birthplace of Austronesian languages

1593
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,800
that this

1594
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,700
because former linguists

1595
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,900
always

1596
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,900
There are two important schools of thought

1597
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:59,100
one is considered to be

1598
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,100
Austronesian should

1599
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:09,520
It should be China from Tibet to Sichuan to the Yangtze River Basin and then down

1600
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:15,080
Go down from the mouth of the Yangtze River Basin and go southeast

1601
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:20,040
A group of American scholars said that

1602
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:27,000
He thinks his language should be a trade language

1603
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,400
is a language of trade

1604
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,720
Because everyone is talking about this

1605
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:36,680
These two academic

1606
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:44,720
But if everyone has overturned the victim's academic theory by now

1607
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,280
Probably everyone believes that Taiwan is the mother emperor

1608
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,600
Because Taiwan is the most complicated place for Nan Daoyu

1609
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,360
Often the place where a language appears most complex

1610
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,560
it was one of the earliest locations

1611
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,120
If Taiwan

1612
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,260
but so early

1613
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,960
So it's at the place of origin

1614
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:05,960
where

1615
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:07,160
won't be taiwan

1616
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:09,200
because all Taiwanese

1617
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:10,960
Aboriginal people now

1618
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,860
It's all coming in from the outside

1619
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,000
mostly chinese

1620
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,460
Southeast coast

1621
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,000
The Indochina Peninsula in the South China Sea brings

1622
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,200
So this place of origin

1623
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,000
can be sure

1624
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:25,760
already knocked over this

1625
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,600
The scholarship on the origin of the island domains of Southeast Asia

1626
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:29,600
This is

1627
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,200
So what about the domestic route?

1628
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,600
this

1629
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,600
probably with

1630
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,800
now for now

1631
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,600
Both agree that it is from Taiwan

1632
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,600
into the Philippines

1633
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,500
To this South China Sea, this Indonesia

1634
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,200
Island baby

1635
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,400
been going east

1636
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,600
still going west

1637
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,800
all the way to masgas

1638
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,400
this area

1639
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,400
then this

1640
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,700
The country's route

1641
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,300
because

1642
01:14:59,000 --> 01:14:59,900
if still

1643
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Originally from mainland China

1644
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
They are all from China

1645
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
It also needs to be rethought on the way of its diffusion

1646
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:17,000
So that's what I think the problem with the ocean's late-night habits

1647
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Many people have been thinking about saying

1648
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Do you think the universe will expand?

1649
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Because of the influence of the emergence of rice culture

1650
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Then if Liangdao eight thousand years ago

1651
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
this we saw it

1652
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Apparently Bright Island is not a place that will be able to grow

1653
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
What is the plowing place for planting

1654
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
So it might be looking for the universe

1655
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Its late night is mainly hunting and gathering at sea

1656
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
while the rice is in

1657
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,160
I'm afraid it's a relatively late flower show.

1658
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,360
So its fluid habit

1659
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,320
Might also be a question to think about

1660
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,360
The eighth is the archaeological field method

1661
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:17,320
This technical update when the human bone was excavated

1662
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,640
I said that I am afraid that we will meet in the future

1663
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,480
Human bones must wear yellow clothes

1664
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,320
I think that's probably an important point

1665
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,080
The fourth is

1666
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,520
Previously because of this DNA study on the island of Goran

1667
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,760
has been less successful

1668
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,160
what's the main thing

1669
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,560
Because DNA extraction is too difficult

1670
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,920
Let me know when we talk about Stone King

1671
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,520
he told the truth

1672
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:49,200
The extraction success rate of DNA from a thousand years ago is extremely low

1673
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,240
Not to mention our eight thousand years of success

1674
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,040
It has been successful for more than seven thousand years

1675
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,040
but then again

1676
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,840
Stone King they became famous because

1677
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,160
Ye'an successfully obtained the DNA sequence of 40,000 years ago

1678
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,280
So its technology is always improving

1679
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,480
So this is also possible in the future

1680
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:18,280
The research of our Liangdao people may stimulate these questions

1681
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,280
let's see the next one

1682
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,500
alright

1683
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,680
This is roughly what I figured out. Let’s talk about some not very important ones.

1684
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:29,880
I also have a few books currently

1685
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,560
I thought everyone would take turns

1686
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,360
Welcome to these three books

1687
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,800
My report looks like this for the first time

1688
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:46,240
The second discovery of Liangdao people's DNA research another book

1689
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:51,880
In addition to this we have already discussed in some papers

1690
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:53,240
some papers

1691
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,840
Also in the international

1692
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:00,040
It was in March last year

1693
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I already have one

1694
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,800
I followed a family

1695
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,800
Together we all wrote

1696
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:13,200
This was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics in the United States

1697
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,600
This is the world's top magazine published

1698
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,600
So our job is roughly

1699
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,200
I have this next

1700
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,400
we have an article coming out soon

1701
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,200
In the following university I published a paper

1702
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,800
I published this one in this

1703
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,400
This is in the EPA

1704
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:39,400
It was published by the Indo-Pacific Institute of Pedagogical Studies

1705
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,000
This paper is probably

1706
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,800
We're all in the process and we're all still publishing

1707
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,400
ok let's see the next one

1708
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,200
Our current research work

1709
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,200
Research on the Periphery of Culture

1710
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,400
we must

1711
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,000
because it's so bright

1712
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Cultures found in this location

1713
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
According to his unearthed naughty, stony

1714
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
especially spine

1715
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
The county magistrate's favorite fisherman

1716
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
What the hell is it around

1717
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
What is the relationship with the surrounding culture?

1718
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
this is what we are going to study

1719
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
This behavior avoids learning

1720
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
this is to be studied

1721
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
paleoenvironmental science is very important

1722
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
paleoenvironmental studies when I was working in Liangdao

1723
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
i just noticed

1724
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I wonder why such a small island

1725
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
How could it be so popular after 8,000 years

1726
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I pay attention to this ecological environment

1727
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
because the horse owner

1728
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
This Daegu guy said

1729
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
must go there every year

1730
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
so he can see umbrella terroir

1731
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And this ecological environment

1732
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
8,000 years ago, the sea level

1733
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
with this now

1734
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,600
what is the change

1735
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:08,200
I once asked academician Liu Shaocheng of our research institute

1736
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:13,900
He said that eight thousand years is about 10 meters lower

1737
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,400
Well, Professor Chen Wanshan from the Geology Department of National Taiwan University

1738
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:21,000
Say about 10 meters to 20 meters

1739
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:23,600
Academician Liu recently told me

1740
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,600
He said that there is no 10 meters or about 3 or 4 meters.

1741
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,400
So the doctrine keeps changing

1742
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,900
All in all he is lowered

1743
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,500
I'm watching while lowering

1744
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,300
because i'm on a cliff

1745
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,400
The mainland fishermen are fishing there

1746
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,500
he's in the shallow water

1747
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:47,100
I'm thinking if it's lower than 10 meters

1748
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:49,400
Presumably his part is because the fishing ground is so

1749
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,800
Every day when we dig there

1750
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,300
he harvests below

1751
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,200
how is he

1752
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,300
Come here every morning and don't go down

1753
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,400
this ichthyosaur

1754
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
send down the fish bowl

1755
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Help Maru collect the ichthyosaur and go back

1756
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Lay another ichthyosaur down

1757
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Twice a day pays off

1758
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
so

1759
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
How about it

1760
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
when it's bone

1761
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
If the sea level shift decreases

1762
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
its soup map

1763
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Bigger face

1764
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Tang Tu maybe that place Tang Lou Kuan

1765
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
So its fish production is booming

1766
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
More magnification

1767
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So this is also our bone environment

1768
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
research is later

1769
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
solving issues

1770
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
and the bone environment for

1771
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Oxygen isotope analysis, etc.

1772
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Animals, plants, grilled bones, etc.

1773
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
certainly

1774
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Our work

1775
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
after making it

1776
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So my most important thing is

1777
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
i cook bone roast in taiwan

1778
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Be sure to talk to the local people

1779
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
I think

1780
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Artifacts from this place

1781
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
should stay here

1782
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
so

1783
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
We measure the whole

1784
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,900
For all the work of Matsu, I exchanged the specimens in the Matsu Folk Museum

1785
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,800
because it's local

1786
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:13,100
How can it have this social collection is what they want to collect

1787
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:18,300
Social education is focused on their native land

1788
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,100
This is my always Le Wei's policy

1789
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,400
how do you see the next one

1790
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:30,200
Future goals Of course I want to deepen this research work

1791
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:32,000
Algorithms of Institutional Capability

1792
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,100
Issues related to the stock environment

1793
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,700
practical strategy

1794
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,300
Research on the Peripheral Correlation of Material Culture

1795
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,500
In this way, lead to a comparative study on No. 1 and No. 2

1796
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,400
this has to be done

1797
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,200
This is what we have done now

1798
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:52,000
I recently went to inspect the opening at this site

1799
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,900
History Museum at History I Nanhai Road

1800
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,200
is still on exhibition

1801
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,900
as free to see

1802
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,400
This guide and the archeology led by Mazu

1803
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,400
Then we still have our model anyway

1804
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,600
we all made it

1805
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:13,200
what we model

1806
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,800
The model of the face is being done now

1807
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,800
not done yet

1808
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,400
And we except human bones

1809
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:22,400
What do we want the guard's face to look like?

1810
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:27,000
So this is hope for our future work

1811
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,200
I'll take another look

1812
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:34,600
This is the long picture I sent just now

1813
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:38,800
This word this is my mediocrity

1814
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,000
this is not good

1815
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,600
this is not a good poem

1816
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,400
I wrote the sequence like this

1817
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,800
Just give it to the present boss

1818
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,000
This Shuhua family is my senior brother

1819
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,200
I have learned from Huang Beiyue's Shuhua family before

1820
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,200
So I haven't written for decades

1821
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I can't write my words

1822
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
dare not measure

1823
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So I asked my brother to write this name

1824
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
give to present

1825
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,000
thank you

1826
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
thank you

1827
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
thank you

1828
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
thank you

1829
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
professor thank you

1830
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
wonderful speech

1831
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
first question

1832
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
i want to ask

1833
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
that professor is

1834
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
professor

1835
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
you think you like

1836
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Your favorite

1837
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Your favorite

1838
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Your favorite

1839
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Your favorite

1840
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Your favorite

1841
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Your favorite

1842
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
the professor is

1843
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,600
that about this

1844
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,960
This number two massive girl

1845
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,260
and sister

1846
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:14,840
just say

1847
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,660
his Yanwu

1848
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:19,200
was taken away

1849
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:22,520
Then I want to know the story too

1850
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,060
just take this

1851
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,620
what is the motive for taking

1852
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:29,440
then bring that

1853
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,840
It was our Yangxian leader who found it.

1854
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,340
Elder brother He Qin, our Yang line is long

1855
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,740
tell us the secret

1856
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:37,640
how is it

1857
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:40,440
How did you get him back?

1858
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,040
get it back as a whole

1859
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,600
how difficult is it

1860
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,740
The second is to say

1861
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,840
all of us

1862
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,200
that bug bone

1863
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,700
worm bone of the whole wrist

1864
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,040
The teeth you see are so neat

1865
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,400
that is to say this

1866
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,160
ancient man's teeth

1867
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,400
Is it all like this? Is it so good?

1868
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,000
Is it because they belong to the exaltation of the ocean?

1869
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,200
So capture more here

1870
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,200
How can there be such a complete one?

1871
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,600
thank you thank you

1872
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,600
Thank you Madam, what is your last name?

1873
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,200
Shuang Mulin

1874
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,000
Miss Ray

1875
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I'm going to apply for this now

1876
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,600
Because of the above three problems

1877
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,000
I give everyone a souvenir of mine

1878
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,200
This souvenir is an 8G USB

1879
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,000
and it has my name written

1880
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,800
light up commemorative

1881
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,000
this souvenir

1882
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,800
thank you professor

1883
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,000
I will answer first

1884
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,400
answer the question first

1885
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,400
Let the magistrate answer his questions again

1886
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,800
The first question is

1887
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,800
why can't i go into details

1888
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,400
It's because it's more tortuous in the middle

1889
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,400
and involved in the scene

1890
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,520
The military is still scouting for undisclosed festivals

1891
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,140
so i can't tell anyone

1892
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:09,340
probably a light

1893
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:10,560
one light

1894
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,520
Only then did he realize the importance of this tooth

1895
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,920
Because in our conception before

1896
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,120
I always thought that teeth are the best place to store DNA

1897
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,960
The study of teeth is the most important

1898
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:27,000
But in fact I just said

1899
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,720
Sent three specimens to Germany

1900
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,520
teeth failed

1901
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,200
Such a long leg bone did not succeed

1902
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,560
Great work by the little ice cubes

1903
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,760
It is the front of the big touch paper

1904
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,560
Small straight bone succeeded

1905
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,800
Most continued to succeed

1906
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,760
OK

1907
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:49,920
this is the first question

1908
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,480
The second question is

1909
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,080
I'm probably the problem

1910
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,560
right

1911
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,360
I answer

1912
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,960
That County Magistrate Yang, do you want to tell us about yourself?

1913
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,000
how did you find out

1914
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Thank you, teacher

1915
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
press press talk

1916
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
no more no more

1917
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
over there this

1918
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
over there this

1919
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Well

1920
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Let's talk about the embarrassing incident first

1921
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Well

1922
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
then

1923
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
uh we judge

1924
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
judge say

1925
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
uh, someone who does this kind of thing

1926
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Not many people do this kind of thing

1927
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Not many people do this kind of thing

1928
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
uh everyone knows

1929
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
if at home

1930
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
dropped things

1931
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
hand stolen words

1932
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
There is a chance to defend the direction

1933
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
he is a direct hit

1934
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
If I get poached, I'll talk and laugh

1935
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,100
He was poached at a very young age, expressing that he is familiar with this environment

1936
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,200
probably answer like this later

1937
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,460
This was found in a safe in Taichung

1938
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:15,300
because

1939
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,300
I

1940
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:21,020
I like being a detective better than being a doctor

1941
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:22,020
Ha ha ha ha

1942
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,360
in addition

1943
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,860
Well

1944
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,660
We just said the head of the membership

1945
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:33,100
For core core difference

1946
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:36,140
very interested why very interested because

1947
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,560
Teacher Chen dug the broken part for the first time

1948
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,760
later on

1949
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:44,840
I've figured out what he's all about

1950
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:48,080
The result was in when digging in the second round

1951
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,380
dig out the whole

1952
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,480
Well

1953
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:54,160
I have a

1954
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,320
The friend who wrote the fishing exhibition in Taiwan is called Li Jialiang

1955
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,200
Fishing known as Taiwan

1956
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
The world has written many articles

1957
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
he told me

1958
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
more than ten thousand years ago

1959
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
There are people in Taiwan who are willing to make up for the surplus

1960
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
so this

1961
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
suddenly we see

1962
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
when the gap was broken

1963
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
imagine what it should be like

1964
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
When we look at that full residual

1965
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Let's see him every step of the way

1966
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
every place

1967
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
his function

1968
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
What is his anatomical function

1969
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
he has his function

1970
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
when i saw

1971
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Is it Yucha or the original Yugou?

1972
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
later thought

1973
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
he should be Yuchai

1974
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,000
because the front is pointed

1975
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
For the convenience of founding

1976
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
he has hook

1977
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
is to prevent drag peach

1978
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
In addition

1979
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
There is a hook for the rope

1980
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
specially engraved

1981
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
means to say

1982
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
At that time there must be a rope to hold

1983
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,640
But now after the fish cavity is played

1984
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:04,040
let it run over the line pull

1985
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,320
Ears running from Bright Island One at the same time

1986
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,800
Has the inherent disease of divers

1987
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:20,400
We boldly recommend that people from Liangdao are second only to diving.

1988
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,440
But the main interest is those things

1989
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,560
The environment in which we recruit

1990
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:31,920
In the environment where we grew up, I feel that these are very familiar

1991
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,800
We just took what we found

1992
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,120
Imagine and fight with the classmates at that time

1993
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:43,040
found that archeology and anthropology are both interesting

1994
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:44,720
thank you all

1995
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,960
I just changed my answer to your question.

1996
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,160
about teeth

1997
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:57,920
This tooth is 32 grams of teeth all in

1998
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,260
probably

1999
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,500
this is our luck

2000
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,980
so unnecessary

2001
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,160
who else

2002
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,320
second place

2003
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:11,280
OK, let's take a look first.

2004
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,040
let me ask this

2005
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,880
1600's economy team

2006
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,080
Looks like it grew from a heterosexual body

2007
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:18,580
right

2008
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,000
not from that

2009
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:22,800
The human body is grown from high school

2010
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,420
These two are different ones

2011
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:26,000
series people

2012
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:26,580
heterogeneous

2013
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,740
The nucleus is not from the nucleus

2014
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:30,420
from the cytoplasm

2015
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:32,280
While looking for this

2016
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,120
it should have several pairs

2017
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,620
what we call factor

2018
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,620
So it should if found

2019
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:40,460
The economic team in 1900 was quite long

2020
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:42,300
According to this should also find

2021
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,300
BMA of other parts

2022
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:46,160
If there is more BMA

2023
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,540
Will this detection classification

2024
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,160
be more precise

2025
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,860
The other is to say

2026
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,860
this number 2

2027
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:54,380
It's hundreds of years late

2028
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:56,380
But now it's a different job

2029
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:59,460
Could it be that they prove each other

2030
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,160
Sometimes the early days come and conquer this early stage

2031
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:07,400
Or what, so if you cancel the tail, I will just cancel you

2032
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,160
That is the key to whether you will have the possibility this time

2033
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,540
That

2034
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,400
The first question I want to answer is about

2035
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:22,960
right

2036
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,840
In fact, the so-called DNA

2037
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:31,280
That is its whole and complete yin and shoulder skin.

2038
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,840
There is a muscle reducing pair

2039
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:38,640
So the main thing is that it needs a lot of stink, that is, it stinks.

2040
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:41,840
A card to it don't let it have missing

2041
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,840
So what I just said is

2042
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,600
what i just said is

2043
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,960
because it was made because its experimental results become

2044
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,600
There are 16569 clip pairs that can be very complete

2045
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,940
so it can make its sequence out when

2046
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:14,300
1 Between 10,000 and 10,000 A

2047
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:18,700
it's me because i didn't do it myself

2048
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,500
I don't know very well

2049
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,100
But I understand it this Metrocontrast is what it is

2050
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:26,100
But about Why Cramor Song

2051
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,500
Now in fact we haven't published

2052
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,900
In fact, the one made is between O1 and O1A

2053
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:36,400
Why can't this be published now?

2054
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,200
Because they do this DNA research business

2055
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,600
It cannot be published arbitrarily

2056
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,200
announced one day

2057
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:46,900
its thesis

2058
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:48,300
it's going to be discounted

2059
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,800
People think you've published

2060
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,700
so it's like this

2061
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:55,100
So I'm just getting started

2062
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:58,700
Certain papers are currently being written

2063
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,540
to be lighter

2064
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
The second question is

2065
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
These two sentences are because you want

2066
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
What I just said was

2067
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
ocean of this generation

2068
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,000
It's basically multi-ethnic groups wandering and drifting

2069
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
so today i come tomorrow

2070
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Longing for them to be hundreds of years apart

2071
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:28,000
so what is their relationship in the middle

2072
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
we really don't know

2073
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
But the odds are too high

2074
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
because think about it

2075
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
In ancient times, if these ethnic groups drifted on the sea

2076
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Because why can we differentiate

2077
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
different ethnic groups

2078
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Mainly because we can have mutation

2079
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
there will be this change

2080
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
mutation

2081
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
The result of the mutation will be

2082
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Almost said a mutation before

2083
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
It takes about 8,000 years for the human master to mutate

2084
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:08,000
So I believe that those who study them think that there may be a picture in about 5000-3000 years

2085
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
There may be a group of pictures

2086
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So we don't know yet

2087
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Apparently it's because it's two different matrilines

2088
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:28,000
And we know that its fine drop is from the generation from the war to the Indochina Peninsula

2089
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
One is our southeast coast of China

2090
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So its origin is these two different origins

2091
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Apparently it's done differently

2092
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
But I forgot to mention that Germans are beautiful

2093
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Very grown up our yellow clothes

2094
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,000
He said it was a pioneering work

2095
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
He said the DNA I made turned out to be zero pollution

2096
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
no pollution at all

2097
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
so it's very clear

2098
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,280
Every part of the stories I just told is important.

2099
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:05,780
every link is important

2100
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,520
If a link is missing, I am afraid

2101
01:37:08,520 --> 01:37:11,520
Of course we are responsible for this.

2102
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,520
This is what I want to answer

2103
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,520
I want to give this friend

2104
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,520
once or twice

2105
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
I would like to ask the professor

2106
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
What I just said is more related to the results of the exam

2107
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I was wondering if you could tell us more about

2108
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
About people around the island

2109
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
They were born anthropologically

2110
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
what kind of state is it

2111
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Especially at the place where the white tent was just now

2112
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
all in water

2113
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
In that state, many ancient people were academic officials

2114
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
seniors accounted for high

2115
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Then life learns the zone of life

2116
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Because the islander has less than one

2117
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
so how could they be in the same voice

2118
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
and some headlines

2119
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
how should their lives be

2120
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
To be introduced from the University section

2121
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Thanks

2122
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Actually the story is too long

2123
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
I'm afraid I'm going to make a long story short

2124
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
This is our archeology guy

2125
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Because especially prehistoric archeology

2126
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Because he has no written record

2127
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,000
so all these jobs

2128
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
material culture

2129
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
come tell us some stories

2130
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,000
we're going to create it

2131
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:44,000
These are prehistoric artifacts

2132
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
We are left with these words

2133
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
The second is his ecological environment

2134
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
leave it to us

2135
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
this question is important

2136
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
My guess on this ecological environment

2137
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Our place just now

2138
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:10,000
It turns out that there is nothing wrong with him being a cliff. It should be an evil soul, but this cross section is only possible because the road opened.

2139
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:23,000
So it turned out that when they came down from the northeast, the place of the evil soul could probably block some wind. This is why they should only live in the inner zone at the earliest.

2140
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But their place of residence, and we found that the second place is a little bit past that place, and that place is flatter, maybe that place is where they live and throw garbage here,

2141
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:56,000
It can also be pushed to the cold field with great difficulty, maybe it is like this, but then again, the phenomenon of the fire pit under the second sentence is obviously a place where people live, and people live there and live here.

2142
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
So we're still working on that.

2143
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Of course, the relationship is also very close, a great relationship. The inner land is obviously not very easy to live in, so I am talking about, in our prison ecology, a very important point for people living in prisons is that the big island is often attached to the mainland, and the small island is attached to the big island.

2144
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:36,000
An island domain is a complete ecological environment, but the material conditions inside are limited. Many things have to be exchanged with each other.

2145
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:52,000
For example, if the island does not have it, there is no way to eat it, and you will not be able to step on the fruit. If you eat protein and fish protein all day long, you will not live long, and you will not live long. It must be starchy, so it must be exchanged.

2146
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:00,000
So that island, the Matsu Islands, can be seen from the other side, and almost every island can see the other side.

2147
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,440
This is because he has to cling to his counterpart

2148
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:08,240
So he's obviously going to catch Yu and come here and live for a while

2149
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:10,040
or seasonal

2150
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,440
not a permanent resident

2151
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:13,640
Definitely Not

2152
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:16,140
can you answer this question

2153
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:17,640
for this I

2154
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:20,940
this is the last side

2155
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:23,240
Thanks

2156
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,240
Thanks

2157
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,240
Thanks

2158
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,520
Speaking

2159
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,520
Hello Professor Chen

2160
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:33,520
I think I have a question and I want to ask you

2161
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,520
Apart from actually seeing shellfish

2162
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:38,520
Know that there are cultural sites other than

2163
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:41,520
Because other clues can be speculated that

2164
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,520
There will be cultural relics here

2165
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,520
in this way

2166
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,520
Usually we archaeologists

2167
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,520
Let's go

2168
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,520
we are going to the fields

2169
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:56,520
when going to investigate

2170
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,520
obviously

2171
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,520
not easy to see first not easy to see

2172
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:07,000
The first and most important thing to judge is the ecological environment

2173
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Water is the most important

2174
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
if there is no water

2175
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
people

2176
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
he can't live there

2177
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
So the water source is the most important

2178
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
So let's say we measure down this place

2179
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
look at him

2180
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
How could he have no river

2181
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
and no

2182
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
But what's interesting is

2183
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Measure the lower layer

2184
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,000
There are many caves entering the bay

2185
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
there is spring water on it

2186
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
early days

2187
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
200 troops are stationed there

2188
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
no supplies

2189
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:42,000
no water supply

2190
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
how do they live

2191
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
They are washbasins

2192
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Use the spring water at the bottom of the cliff to line the water

2193
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
includes a basin of water

2194
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
including face wash

2195
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
do many things

2196
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
to the last

2197
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:17,000
When we go to investigate, the most important thing is to first check whether the environment is inhabited and where is the water source? Probably like this

2198
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Islands like this, of course, are places close to the sea, which is relatively safe, like being on a cliff, I can’t figure out why I’m going back there, this is also art, so let’s talk about it

2199
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:46,000
If it wasn't so high, if it wasn't for its formation, which is sandy red soil, this human bone would not have been preserved for so long

2200
01:43:46,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Because usually our archeology will find human bones, which are usually inside the shellfish, and the shellfish is a protective layer, because the shells on it are so well covered

2201
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:07,000
He said coldly that Le Zhan had nothing to do with it.

2202
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
he doesn't get through

2203
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
The laterite water of the sand has flowed away

2204
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
so he is dry

2205
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
In that life his place is dry

2206
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
So I guess these are the conditions

2207
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Of course I have a good chance

2208
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
After a lifetime of archaeology, I dug up these two sentences

2209
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Everything else is digging a lot of light

2210
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
No one makes up

2211
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
thanks sorry i'm out of ideas

2212
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Feel sorry

2213
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Thanks

2214
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Is there any more?

2215
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,000
I am a southern nation

2216
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Are you called a Pulician?

2217
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Because when I arrived in Ryukyu

2218
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
he kept that time

2219
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,880
But it's like this from the mainland

2220
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,500
He said no, we are a southern democracy, so we don’t care about it.

2221
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:09,460
just to leave a little place

2222
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:11,260
that language has six or five

2223
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:12,960
no

2224
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:19,900
Another one is Beijing Yuanren and this

2225
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:23,900
But naturally they say the term "big Buddha"

2226
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:27,100
and this

2227
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:29,100
and this

2228
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:31,100
and this

2229
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:33,100
and this

2230
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,100
and this

2231
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:39,100
These

2232
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:41,100
These

2233
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:43,100
These

2234
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:45,100
These

2235
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:47,100
this

2236
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:49,100
this

2237
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:51,100
because we are old

2238
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:53,100
still not sure

2239
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:55,100
Thanks

2240
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:58,100
The Lycians are in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

2241
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:00,100
that is now next

2242
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,200
Since the South Island universe is a kind of country since Beijing

2243
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:12,000
In the South Island Universe we are talking about, there used to be a man named Marel Polaris

2244
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,280
he is not australian

2245
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:17,400
The Austronesian universe we are talking about

2246
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:19,760
napoles is to the east

2247
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:25,300
a district in the middle of the pacific east of vip doppin

2248
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:30,300
About Peking Man because he is 500,000 to 600,000 years old

2249
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:36,700
From now on, if he is not now, he cannot be compared with our current race.

2250
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:41,100
because he is a branch of anthropology

2251
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:45,300
He is called Homo erectus pecinesis

2252
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:49,100
Homo erectus Beijing species

2253
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:51,300
He is hundreds of thousands of years old

2254
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:56,300
Many of us think that the Chinese are Beijing

2255
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:58,300
The main line is Pekingese

2256
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:59,300
wrong

2257
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
out of africa theory

2258
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
There are two different things with Beijingers

2259
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Because in those early days, those people felt that

2260
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
We are now probably after we came out of Africa

2261
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It probably came out around 60,000 years ago

2262
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Only came out between 50,000 and 60,000 years

2263
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Distributed all over the world

2264
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,000
This is probably like this

2265
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Thanks

2266
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Just now you asked me that the whole teacher was slightly ahead of schedule

2267
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I'm a researcher

2268
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
To suddenly say that the US job is written similar to the investment

2269
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
The question I just asked is

2270
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,000
The archaeologist you found has been back and forth

2271
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Then you were sometimes protected on your back just now

2272
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I'm thinking maybe it's also because of the carbon build-up

2273
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But for soils that have a handover effect

2274
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It is not easy to distinguish between various protections

2275
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I feel at ease when I was a flower girl like this when I was a child

2276
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
The second point is that you are here

2277
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Dig up to 8000 years ago

2278
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
7000 years of volume guide

2279
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Is it possible to continue digging at this amount?

2280
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
1,000 years, 4,000 years, and 3,000 years can be found

2281
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and that's it

2282
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
thank you thank you

2283
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Number one, you're low on power

2284
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
coaching, coaching very happy

2285
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Because in fact, it is probably carbonic acid

2286
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
is that it was planted in this layer

2287
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
It itself has protection against the energy body

2288
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
For example, in our archeology in Taiwan

2289
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
The original businessman is planted to produce human bones

2290
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Because how it was planted inside

2291
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
So it can only come out after being planted

2292
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,000
The protection I just mentioned is useful

2293
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
the second you talk about this

2294
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,240
i'm so sorry

2295
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:10,400
Can you still dig in eight days?

2296
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:11,800
I have to answer this

2297
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:15,400
Because of that whole chair you just watched Zai Cangchang's

2298
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:18,400
Of course you can dig

2299
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:22,600
But those of us who do archaeology often have a principle

2300
01:49:22,600 --> 01:49:25,400
The smaller the area to dig

2301
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:29,000
The more information obtained, the more

2302
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,200
we're going to stop

2303
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:33,700
because if you dig again

2304
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:38,700
It's probably amazing. I need to add a little more to your business.

2305
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:45,600
But we have to think about the descendants of our archaeologists

2306
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:52,100
Because all subjects are closer to Nikkei

2307
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:57,900
His current technology may be better than ours in the future

2308
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:00,000
we gotta save some sanity for them

2309
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
this is the point

2310
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Thanks

2311
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Thanks

2312
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Mr. Liu

2313
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Mr. Liu

2314
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
teacher sorry

2315
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
bother your time

2316
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I have a question

2317
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
I study

2318
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
previous climate

2319
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
besides

2320
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
China's climate change in the past 2000 years

2321
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
I think

2322
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Southeast coast

2323
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Talk to Teacher Chen

2324
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Measure the elderly

2325
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
About 7 or 8 years old

2326
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
7, 8, 7 years now

2327
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
they were

2328
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
our ancestors

2329
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
very early in the southeast

2330
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Southeast China and South China

2331
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
there were activities at that time

2332
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Measure the elderly

2333
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
At the time

2334
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
performance of life and climate

2335
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Is it with South China

2336
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
The generation on the southeast coast

2337
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Thanks

2338
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
actually related

2339
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,500
I believe it should not be a small area problem

2340
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,100
For example, let me make a metaphor

2341
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:08,600
Like we just talked about sea level

2342
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:11,900
Sea level rise is after the ice age

2343
01:51:11,900 --> 01:51:17,900
During the ice age, its sea level was about 120 meters away from the present

2344
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:20,100
lower so low

2345
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:23,800
So it's hard for us to find it now

2346
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:27,500
Because it must be close to the sea and must be under the sea.

2347
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:31,500
Then the rise is from slowly rising slowly to

2348
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:36,000
It was only about 6,000 years ago that it was relatively stable

2349
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,500
During the 8,000 years, of course, there was a little gap between about 1 or 2 meters.

2350
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:45,500
So presumably this climate change is global

2351
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:48,800
Of course, locality doesn't matter that much.

2352
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,800
I'm going to say this

2353
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:50,800
Thanks

2354
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,800
Thanks

2355
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,800
I really want to ask about the Japanese scriptures

2356
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Their savanna pottery also developed 10,000 years ago

2357
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:09,000
It is also believed that they are talking to fish

2358
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
It's like saying it belongs to Zhuang

2359
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Sorry, I'm not sure how to define it

2360
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I think this thing is very similar to the marine industry with a small number of people.

2361
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
maybe there is something related

2362
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Don't want professors to behave in this respect

2363
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
thank him for this

2364
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,000
The test of Japanese programs is divine writing

2365
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Divine language and other culture

2366
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,000
They can find around 12,000 years

2367
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It also appeared in the later period of the army

2368
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Their scriptures are thicker and thicker

2369
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
very crude scriptures

2370
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
probably like this

2371
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Basically because Japan basically it's islands

2372
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
island country

2373
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
So it's still a form or an island life form

2374
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Of course Japan has many

2375
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:12,480
So now there is a country in the world that studies islands called the Small Island Association

2376
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,980
is the island

2377
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:18,980
It only studies populations that cannot exceed 100,000

2378
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:21,980
This area cannot exceed

2379
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:27,980
I can't remember, and it's very clear that tens of square kilometers are like this

2380
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:29,960
Zhou Research Isle

2381
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:33,960
Because the distance between the big island and the small island is actually quite big.

2382
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,960
It's quite a big gap

2383
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:41,960
But basically relying on the sea is related to the sea

2384
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,960
Oshima still has some

2385
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,960
For example, we have so many in Taiwan

2386
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:49,960
Later, the aborigines all ran away and all lived on the mountain.

2387
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,960
But was it chased?

2388
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:53,960
no

2389
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:58,940
It turned out to be suitable for mountains and hills

2390
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,940
they go to the mountains and hills

2391
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
it won't be on the plains

2392
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,700
This is another one

2393
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:07,340
We spent too long and I will not talk more

2394
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:08,340
Thanks

2395
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:23,040
This our vice president is taking the exam

2396
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,340
this test me

2397
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:26,940
This text teacher said

2398
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:31,280
All chairs are important to us

2399
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:34,280
Of course there are chairs

2400
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:36,600
by its nature

2401
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:39,780
its size its scale its integrity

2402
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:42,280
This hierarchy is a false name

2403
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:45,600
But the importance is actually important

2404
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:48,180
But some so-called unimportant

2405
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:50,680
it if many of the same chairs

2406
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:53,340
you don't write it's importance

2407
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:54,980
it's important to separate

2408
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,020
its layers are going to separate

2409
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:59,520
But like Liangdao this is

2410
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,520
Taichu

2411
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000

Professor Chen is 80 years old

2418
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000

2419
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
