OK

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because it can get from us to here

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that we just said

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
but we can't see

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
OK, OK

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000

His greatest contribution was to propose the theory

61
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,840
Explain the special physical phenomenon of high temperature superbody

62
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,840
It is all caused by the strong optical connection of electrons.

63
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,640
So today he will introduce us to

64
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,840

For us from the title of this speech is

81
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,660
From quantum to classical physics

82
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,920
limited group behavior

83
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,120
this is what we are looking forward to

84
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,920
with this brilliant speech

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,260
So we now welcome Academician Li with applause

86
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
we are

87
00:07:44,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Thank you Vice President Zhou for the invitation

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,220
His introduction is greatly appreciated

89
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,620
Vice President Zhou can invite me to come today

90
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,000
This is the list of all Dean Zhu Jiahua

91
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
To have this opportunity to remember him with him

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,120
In fact, the reason why I am very happy is that

93
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,320
In addition to my Academia Sinica for more than 20 years

94
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,960
It was Master Chang Ang's bribery and Dean Zhu Quan's

95
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,120
outside of help

96
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
sorry

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Apart from the help of Dean Zhu Quan

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Besides, I actually have some other connection with him.

99
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This correlation is the physical problem I want to talk about today

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then this correlation is that Dean Zhu Jiahua’s nerve is Sun Yat-sen University

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Di Zixi, this is not Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Of course, his disciple Xi Xi is called the play director and vice principal.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Headmaster for many years

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
why did i mention this in particular

106
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because my father-in-law, Principal Zhou Fengqi

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Also graduated from Sun Yat-Sen University

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Actually he

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
My father-in-law and his family are in business in Guiyang

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
His reasons for doing education

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In fact, it was inspired by Dean Zhu

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Dean Zhu especially encouraged him to engage in education

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So he held it in Guiyang and started to organize

114
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
When I was in middle school for a while, I was fighting

115
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
run a temporary middle school

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
In fact, a lot of money

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was run with money from their own family business.

118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is what I think his whole life

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
are contributing to education

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
student development

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think it is worthy of my admiration

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I personally appreciate this of course

123
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Dean Zhu's contribution to this education

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There is a very big effort to contribute to Taiwan's education

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,500
I have many classmates now

126
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,000
In fact, it was Chiayi Middle School back then.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
against Taichung No. 1 Middle School

128
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
My father-in-law was the principal at the time

129
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,000
so i think it's a great opportunity

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll also talk a little bit

131
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,000
Some thoughts on my research

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,500
The topic I chose today is of course a bit strange

133
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,000
because when I'm thinking about something

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I remember several students came to ask me

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,500
What aspect of current physics research should be done

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,500
Of course it's a big problem

137
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
important question for students

138
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Which aspect of research is better

139
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,500
So I probably thought about it a little bit myself

140
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,000
what were those highlights of my past research

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I just realized that I will give two examples today

142
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,480
The problem I'm mainly working on is of course related to this

143
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,600
This collective behavior is group behavior

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,200
This emerging means

145
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,900
Forever limited in Chinese translation of this word is a bit complicated

146
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,600
It is related to the emerging behavior called eternal limit

147
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,100
In particular I want to get two examples

148
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,700
Of course, it has something to do with quantum and classical

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,800
The most important question to think about

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,400
This is the season 19 to 24 from the beginning

151
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Of course physics has made great progress

152
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,800
especially when most of us

153
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,600
We already know these important equations

154
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,000
Everyone knows the Maxual Equation

155
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,700
Of course, this is very important for the current IT industry

156
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,500
All of these are included under the Maxual Equation

157
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
With this photoelectric conduction all problems

158
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
probably can understand

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,600
Just use it in different occasions, in different ways

160
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
But another fact, of course we also know about quantum mechanics

161
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,940
The Schrodinger equation

162
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,440
It is the beginning of this important quantum mechanics

163
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Of course, this year's Nobel lecture confirmed the correctness and magic of quantum mechanics

164
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,640
I'll talk about the magic in a minute

165
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,140
is this year's special

166
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,640
There are many aspects of quantum mechanics that are still incomprehensible

167
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:33,080
But like Einstein said throwing dice

168
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,080
This problem is also confirmed

169
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,380
This year, of course, the Nobel lecture was given to something related to this

170
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,080
Then with this dilemma, of course we add Einstein

171
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,880
general relativity more than a hundred years ago

172
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,440
Plus Newton's Mechanics

173
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:59,880
We use Sensory to have all the basic theoretical equations in physics

174
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,760
Most of the phenomena you just use the theory of these equations

175
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,000
You should be able to gain insight into almost any phenomenon

176
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Or you can predict all phenomena

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,300
The answer is on the other hand

178
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,400
Also because we've seen a lot of basic examples

179
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,100
we know all atoms

180
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,700
what we know about atoms and more

181
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,500
The universe is formed from these basic examples

182
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,400
Then of course why there is this basic example

183
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,000
that's another mystery

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,700
But at least we know these basic examples

185
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,800
can do all kinds of understanding

186
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
So we have the basic ingredients

187
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,800
Plus all table chemistry biomaterials

188
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,600
any scientific application

189
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,200
Seems like we've all figured it out

190
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,100
So this is what many people say

191
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,900
talk about most of the problems

192
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,600
we all have it

193
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
should have the answer

194
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,000
so many people think

195
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
As long as we understand the table from each state

196
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,900
individual atoms

197
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,100
we can understand all

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Of course this is reductionism

199
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It is an important direction of science in various disciplines

200
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
To put it simply, you only need to start from the basic physical structure

201
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Come learn about the many universities that have succeeded in physics

202
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Now start from some of the most basic equation theory theories

203
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you can push all kinds of conclusions

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
as many scientists believe

205
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If we knew every gene

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
we can understand all life phenomena

207
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Of course, now I know that maybe this thought is a bit too naive

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And if you use it like this, there is no important problem to solve

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So I remember around the twenty-first century

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
At the end of the twentieth century some theories were that

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Isn't science already... important science is over

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
should know

213
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Of course we now know that this is...

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
still far

215
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
The science we really want to understand is much harder than this

216
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,000
But here's at least one interesting question

217
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
it's a philosophical question

218
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
That is, do we use it like this

219
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,400
we can understand all the problems

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,800
But now we know this

221
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
what i want to say today is

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
We explored from another direction

223
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,600
It is these certain phenomena that are possible

224
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,200
But the most important question we unearth

225
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,400
These in each of these complex

226
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,800
The forces between the components of these systems when

227
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,600
will produce new phenomena

228
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
The phenomenon of your merging is that you did not expect it at all

229
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
is that you understand each element

230
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,800
You don't understand new phenomena either, do you?

231
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
you have no way of predicting

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
predicted

233
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,400
That's what we're going to talk about today

234
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,800
A few two examples to explain this

235
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,400
Then one of the comparisons is very simple

236
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Of course, if you know carbon

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,600
you know two carbons

238
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,000
three

239
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,200
You add in type should understand a lot of carbon

240
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Of course, let me give you an example here

241
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,300
carbon can be turned into diamond

242
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
It's a very good ghetto. It's hard.

243
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,800
But it can also turn into carbon, which is fragile

244
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,700
not a very good conductor of electricity

245
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,800
not very good extremist either

246
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,700
it can also become graphite creek

247
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,300
it is a good conductor of electricity

248
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,200
Then you can also become carbon nanotubes

249
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,500
It is both a conductor and an insulator

250
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
see how you turn it

251
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
you are turning in the wrong direction

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
it becomes a conductor

253
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Can become extinct

254
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Then your two layers of graphite creek

255
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,700
Can become an insulator, conductor, or superconductor

256
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,100
That's the latest research

257
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,500
then found out

258
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,300
you put these two

259
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,500
This is a very important contribution of our Vice President Zhou here

260
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,800
is when you want to put these two together

261
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
turned a little

262
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
You will find that there is a completely different phenomenon

263
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
Everything is not what you imagined, carbon

264
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,300
Nothing to do with what I said before

265
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,400
then this is interesting

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
just something simple

267
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
But when there are many things

268
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,800
put together, many new phenomena appear

269
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
It's just the easiest

270
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
but here we still

271
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,400
We can probably still understand

272
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,800
like this why

273
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,200
because we have basic company

274
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
But here we find

275
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
We're pretty much the latest in the field

276
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,800
There are still many questions we don't know yet

277
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,200
what the hell is going on

278
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,800
OK

279
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,400
That's not what we imagined at first

280
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,200
what about here

281
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,000
I want to follow a standard

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
emerging behavior

283
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,200
This is almost everyone

284
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,400
This is from youtube

285
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,400
There are probably hundreds of thousands of these birds here

286
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,000
it's here

287
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,600
This is called this, what is it called starling

288
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,000
The stardings fly here

289
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,800
then you can watch its movement

290
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,400
very interesting

291
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,800
When they act very

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
compromise together

293
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,800
they are moving together

294
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
I stop this sound

295
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
The voice behind is incredible

296
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,600
This was taken at an airport

297
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,500
it is very amazing

298
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,200
hundreds of thousands of times

299
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,800
But the direction of their fascination seems to be one

300
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,600
So some people are asking how this came about

301
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,700
He obviously doesn't have a leader

302
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,800
we little birds are leaderless

303
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
didn't he have a bird take the lead and say

304
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I should put left, right, up, down

305
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,200
he has no leader at all

306
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
But his behavior is very clear

307
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,900
they are one in motion

308
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,200
How to achieve such a fast one-piece movement

309
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,000
This flock of birds is a famous example, along with the flock of fish

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,500
It is emerging collective behavior

311
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,800
is the interaction between the elements

312
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,500
form those special forms

313
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,800
is not a property of the original element

314
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,700
These are, of course, the so-called definitions

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
New New King is every element of your original

316
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Individually have some special properties

317
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,040
but when added together

318
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,640
Those properties may have been lost in individual properties

319
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
it has new properties appearing

320
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,740
So wait a minute, these two examples I'm going to give

321
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,180
The example I'm going to talk about today

322
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,540
it has something to do with this

323
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,900
Then the two examples I gave

324
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,840
Today is one that I have been working on for many years

325
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,640
quantum physics of course

326
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,980
The simplest one is, of course, what I want to talk about is the phenomenon of superconductivity.

327
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,680
This material superconductivity phenomenon is from top to bottom

328
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,480
The so-called top-down means that I already know the basic theory

329
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,680
Starting from these theoretical models to explain the phenomenon of Yongerjing

330
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,380
hope is

331
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,880
But of course we can find that many are beyond our original imagination

332
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Another example of exactly the opposite is classical physics

333
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,280
Collective phenomenon of cranial nerves

334
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,680
That's what I've studied for many years

335
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
In fact, in recent years

336
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,640
especially after retirement

337
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,580
More time to study is

338
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,380
Collective phenomena of the cranial nerves

339
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,840
This is bottom up

340
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,340
So the two examples are the exact opposite

341
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,580
is that it is generalized from the experimental data

342
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,880
Deriving new physics to advance complete theories

343
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,340
This is of course far from a complete theory.

344
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,000
Just start looking for data now

345
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,080
new laws of physics

346
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,420
Such an approach is, of course, two extreme examples.

347
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,280
one is

348
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
And these two examples are actually these two

349
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,780
In this Emergency Behavior

350
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,580
A real example of two extremes

351
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,880
very extreme example

352
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,180
One is that we know very little

353
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,480
one is that we know a lot

354
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
But we still have a lot of new emergency phenomena

355
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,380
is what we're totally groping for

356
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,380
unexpected

357
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,580
So what about these two examples

358
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,180
The two I specifically chose are the ones that happen to be Almost Extreme

359
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:56,880
Counter Exam

360
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,880
I am a quantity

361
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
one is bitter

362
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The first place that talked about why the instructor chose the instructor at the time can understand

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This is really an emerging phenomenon

364
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The first example was conducted in 1911, you may have heard

365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This is the most famous one, which is in the museum

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,000
This Gentlemen Hike, Camelin Onnes at Lydon University

367
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Last time I visited they had a Museum

368
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There he has this picture, the resistance of his two arches

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It is found that at about 4.2 degrees, its resistance becomes very small

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
about 10's of -50's ohms, he jumped 5 orders of magnitude to get here

371
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
almost like

372
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This question is of course interesting

373
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The question is is it really 0 or almost 0

374
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's certainly an interesting question

375
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Because 0 is not a simple number

376
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
0 is not 0.001

377
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
nor 0.001

378
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's just 0 without any decimal point

379
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is of course a very special number

380
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Is it because the experiment is not done well?

381
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So of course there was a lot of debate when it came out

382
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Of course it took promise

383
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
not for this reason

384
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
just saw super old

385
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It uses the Noble watch because it does low-temperature experiments

386
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It lowers the temperature to

387
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So he was breaking the Guinness Records

388
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
lowest temperature

389
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
it reaches the minimum

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
This is an absolute temperature of 4.2 degrees

391
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
is now minus 269 degrees

392
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We set negative 269 degrees

393
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
OK 269 degrees

394
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
terribly cold

395
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,400
It can achieve this lowest temperature and it finds strange phenomena

396
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,800
so it bumps from that

397
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,600
Tell it that it's not because of the discovery of superconductors

398
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,000
HV discovers superconductor has no promise yet

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
In addition to the high-temperature superconductors that I will talk about later

400
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,600
In fact, no one talks about it because of this.

401
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,200
But let's think about it around that time

402
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,100
Is it true spirit or almost spirit

403
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,200
Of course, let's first understand the mechanism of resistance

404
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
Let me talk about blocking mechanism and this review

405
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
i think everyone knows

406
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,800
You have an electric box

407
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
It will be a little shocking when it is in motion

408
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,300
Electricity crash

409
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,300
like atomic boxes and so on or other electrons bumping around

410
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,500
Of course, it's quite complicated for you to go from here to here.

411
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,900
you're going to hit a lot of places

412
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,400
so you have resistance

413
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
will create resistance

414
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Sometimes it hits you and it hits back and back and back

415
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,400
So this is when you are exercising

416
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
it doesn't go in a straight line

417
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,600
so simple

418
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,900
So there is resistance

419
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,300
everyone understands this

420
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,700
this is

421
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,800
Just like liquids have resistance when they flow

422
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,300
The problem with this is, but this graph

423
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,800
But when everyone makes this picture

424
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
everyone is thinking

425
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,600
The question of whether it is a spirit or not just now becomes very interesting.

426
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,800
Why? These two pictures

427
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,100
This picture I put together two pictures

428
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,600
A green wire is a resistor

429
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,000
it slows down with the temperature

430
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,200
When it reaches a temperature we call the temperature of the spirit world

431
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,800
it becomes spirit, descends to spirit

432
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,800
But the other line draws the heat capacity

433
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What is heat capacity?

434
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,400
That is to say, if you add a nine-hour heat

435
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,300
how many degrees will it heat up

436
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,200
Every material is different

437
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,100
Its temperature rises and rises like water

438
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,900
Everyone thinks to add a lot of heat and it will rise by one degree

439
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,100
OK, some of them are easy to upgrade

440
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,600
That temperature rise

441
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,300
change with temperature

442
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,200
How much hot dust can be absorbed by its heat capacity

443
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
are different

444
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,500
Then this picture, why show this picture?

445
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,200
Don't explain it in this picture, why?

446
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
But this graph has a very special idea

447
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So at this point it suddenly gets bigger and smaller

448
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I'll tell you this right away

449
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Above and below this temperature

450
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The material will change

451
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
This material is not the original material

452
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
below this temperature

453
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Because it suddenly has a completely different

454
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Variations with temperature

455
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
so you think

456
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
This is actually

457
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If you know that water turns into steam

458
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This also has a similar behavior

459
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
when a similar phenomenon

460
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
know it's a phase change

461
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
phase transition

462
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
But this temperature is called transboundary temperature

463
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
These are two crossing points towards the middle

464
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
is a boundary temperature

465
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The middle makes water change from liquid to gas

466
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
is 4100 degrees

467
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
So everyone knows it's a transboundary temperature

468
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
here is a problem

469
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Of course the two are not exactly the same

470
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
but almost

471
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
So I use this to say

472
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
For example, everyone is familiar with

473
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
but here to tell you

474
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
it is a phase transition

475
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So this metamorphosis

476
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
may be real spirit

477
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
because it has a phase transition

478
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,700
it's not almost 0

479
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,400
If there is no phase inversion surface

480
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,700
It's very likely that you didn't do the experiment well.

481
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,300
This problem is of course now often when new superconductors are discovered

482
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,000
This question should be fried

483
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,800
Did you really see a superconductor or a fake?

484
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
This problem is all

485
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,600
Of course, there are other experiments

486
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,800
But this experiment tells you very clearly

487
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
there is a horizontal

488
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,300
there is a Xiangtai

489
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,900
And this Xiangtai has entered a new state

490
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,900
it's high temperature

491
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,900
arch

492
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,800
The situation is completely different from its low temperature situation

493
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
is another situation

494
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,900
It changes the whole system

495
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,600
when this changes

496
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,500
it suddenly becomes 0

497
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
this is of course interesting

498
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,700
like i just said 0

499
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,800
not 0.0000

500
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,300
is 0

501
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,600
That's a Magic Number

502
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,300
this is

503
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,100
I remember a long time ago I read a book

504
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Chinese before

505
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,960
When using zero, don't use zero

506
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,760
Chinese don't have zero

507
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
In the beginning, the Chinese had both positive and negative

508
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,000
jump over zero

509
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,960
I don't want to write this zero

510
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,200
this zero is one

511
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,440
Jiexun is one

512
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,000
indian mathematician

513
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,440
raised zero

514
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,200
then this zero

515
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
Ten out is very special

516
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,800
In fact, this is of course very related to quantum

517
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Because zero is like zero one two three

518
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,240
Precise

519
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
not zero zero one

520
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
either have

521
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,000
or nothing nothing

522
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
almost likely to have

523
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,040
ok

524
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,600
he is very sure

525
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,540
then here is

526
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,200
Let this happen as soon as he comes out

527
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,800
Once confirmed, it is known that this is a quantum phenomenon

528
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,240
You have entered a quantum state

529
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,640
This is known immediately from a

530
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,840
state of classical physics

531
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,240
It can be said that it has entered a quantum state.

532
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,340
up the system

533
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,200
Then this is of course at a very low temperature

534
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,560
Very high temperature, is it possible for four temperatures

535
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,440
After 46 years of hard work

536
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,000
Physicists have finally come up with a theory to explain this phenomenon

537
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,600
Then of course how many arguments went through

538
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,640
Find the most famous of these three is

539
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,440
Badin, Kupp, Xu Ruifu

540
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,240
Those three came up with a theory in 1957

541
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,440
They gave a lecture on this theory in 1972 with a Noble watch

542
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,040
To explain this phenomenon of manipulation

543
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,280
Well, this theory is of course for everyone to see.

544
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,280
There are so many new concepts that have changed many minds

545
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,000
That also explains the phenomenon of this manipulation very clearly.

546
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,280
this is an outstanding job

547
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:49,280
When I went to Buwang University to study for a Ph.D.

548
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,080
It's time for graduate school

549
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,280
In fact, before I went there, I went to the American library

550
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
USIS

551
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,640
There are many interventions in American universities to check in this way

552
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
he was at brown university

553
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So I originally wanted to find him as a directing professor

554
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Leon Cooper

555
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Say what you say

556
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But after I went there I found out

557
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
People told me he doesn't do physics research

558
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
He started doing neuroscience at that time

559
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
just do neuroscience

560
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I am the same as I am now

561
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Probably because people start doing neuroscience research when they get old

562
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
this is very interesting

563
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I can't help if he doesn't do this

564
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Then I had to change to another professor

565
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
but anyway

566
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
At that time it turned out that shepherd went to brown university

567
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
The explanation of this theory is very explanatory

568
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
He not only explained the mechanism of superconductivity

569
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Why is there superconductivity

570
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
for what reason

571
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Also understand the quantity-mass state of superconductivity

572
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Simultaneously address two major issues

573
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
their explanation is simple

574
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
because of superconductivity

575
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The first reason is

576
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,660
The two batteries become a pair

577
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,160
called Cooper pair

578
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,460
Cooper Coober vs.

579
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,700
That's Mr. Cooper just now

580
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,200
He proves two batteries

581
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,500
when up and down

582
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,260
one he chooses

583
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,560
Everyone knows that there is an optional battery

584
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,560
he turns left or right

585
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,700
Clockwise transfer or anti-clockwise transfer

586
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,560
he has two choices

587
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,760
Which one do you want him to choose?

588
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,500
but he can

589
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,660
but there are two

590
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,900
one up and one down

591
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
The two of them like to form a couple

592
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,500
This pair is paired up and down

593
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,760
It's called Cooper pair

594
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,400
It's an incredibly important job

595
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,100
This work broke through at once

596
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,400
many questions

597
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,500
After this job comes out

598
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,200
He said it was due to this reason

599
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,360
Fried to Taiwan

600
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,300
all electricity will do

601
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,760
Of course this problem is troublesome

602
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,400
have a problem

603
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Because both of them are power

604
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,600
are the same electricity and

605
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,700
We know that two electricity and

606
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,600
the same is exclusive

607
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,100
The Max Equation I just talked about

608
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,100
the old man will know

609
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,100
you have no reason

610
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You two are going to be a couple

611
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
it is clearly repulsive

612
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Isn't the farther away the better?

613
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So the question is of course

614
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Need to find a mechanism immediately

615
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
why doesn't it reject

616
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
become attractive

617
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Will the two of them be attracted to each other?

618
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Then they also found the reason

619
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
They all found the reason

620
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Of course there is a reason

621
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Their paper can be completed in one go

622
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
The reason is that

623
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Because this is in the material

624
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
There are also positively charged nuclei

625
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The atomic nucleus is positively charged

626
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
electrons are negative

627
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
the nucleus vibrates

628
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
When the nuclei are sometimes too close together

629
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It likes negative electrons and likes to go

630
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Because there are more positive electricity

631
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
The positive electron went

632
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Another electron also likes to go

633
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
If both charges go it becomes

634
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
seems attractive

635
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But their attraction is through

636
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
the retarder behind it

637
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,300
caused by the environment

638
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
this is interesting

639
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,100
is your environment will affect

640
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,800
take your original repulsive force

641
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,500
become an attraction

642
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
more than your original repulsion

643
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,700
Then this is of course a

644
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,200
incredible assumption

645
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
Of course, this assumption was later proved

646
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,800
That's why I didn't get the Nobel Prize until 1972.

647
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Because a lot of time to prove these issues

648
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Of course it was later proved

649
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,600
this is fine

650
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,300
Then this is to make people cry

651
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,700
Then I took this all

652
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,900
Published a special issue for the last time in 100 years

653
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,200
To commemorate this 100 years this

654
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,500
The diagram used in the special issue of 100 years since the discovery of superconductors

655
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,900
this is very clear

656
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,500
It can be explained roughly by the diagram

657
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
not hurt

658
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,600
your environment will attack you

659
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
extra appeal

660
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,100
change your original

661
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,900
it's interesting

662
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,400
It turns out that the two should be mutually exclusive

663
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,800
Suddenly they no longer reject

664
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,900
That's certainly an interesting question.

665
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
that's the same problem

666
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Is that electron the original electron?

667
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Because logically they want to reject

668
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
In fact, the result of this final theory is OK

669
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
tell everyone now

670
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
He believed that Shenxiu's electrons no longer had the characteristics of the original electrons.

671
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Electron has lost its original characteristics

672
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
This is the difference of emerging

673
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'll talk later

674
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
is that you have a new nature

675
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The original old nature is gone

676
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
This is an interesting example

677
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
that this is not enough

678
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Just like this will not be without electrons

679
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's just a pair, then you can still bump

680
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
There are walls and tables or bumps

681
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
But now I use this as an example

682
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I always think it's the best

683
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I haven't been able to find this on YouTube

684
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
to manifest this dance

685
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I don't know if you have seen the old movies

686
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Our older adults used to watch this kind of

687
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
this one from russia

688
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,600
artist, who painted this large in Vienna before the nineteenth century

689
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Big Borum Dancing, Waltz

690
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,600
dance the waltz, these men and women are paired up like this, they're dancing

691
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,200
And then they'll spin around, and then they'll switch partners

692
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,400
Jump like this, no matter how you dance

693
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,800
they never hit the wall table table and each other

694
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,200
It is very harmonious along with the music, no matter how you dance, it is very beautiful

695
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,800
Two exchanges, how to jump, very harmonious

696
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Most importantly, why doesn't he bump around

697
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,200
Because their steps are very coherent, in harmony, in tune

698
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,500
he won't each other

699
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,900
If there is a person who is faster or slower, he will come out soon

700
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,600
It’s so big, so I thought that if there are those movies that dance this

701
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,900
That's really amazing, everyone has to practice for a long time

702
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,200
Don't bump around, jump very

703
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,900
But if you think about it, now I'm drawing

704
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,900
One is an electron going up and one is going down

705
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,900
These two electrons are like this, and they are optimal in the whole material.

706
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,560
Ten twenty three electrons

707
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,600
sons of ten or twenty

708
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,440
Astronomical numbers are doing this

709
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,140
then exchange each other

710
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,440
They are exchanging positive and negative

711
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,940
Zhi Zhi spin up

712
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,740
Zhixuan down here to exchange back and forth

713
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,640
then all jumping

714
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,500
But they didn't bump into each other

715
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,200
none hit

716
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,540
Even if there are tables and chairs, they won't hit each other

717
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,840
so no electrons

718
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,440
This is a quantum state

719
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,640
This is an all-seeing quantum state

720
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,200
What's the meaning

721
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,540
It's all electrons working together to do the same thing

722
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,900
a fully owned electron

723
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,340
This is an amazing imagination

724
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,740
if you imagine this

725
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,800
How could such a thing happen in the world

726
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,600
How do you make electronics so obedient

727
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,500
all do the same thing

728
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,740
And do it very well

729
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,840
You have another table and chair

730
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,240
Like the thing that produces resistance just mentioned

731
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,940
has no effect on it

732
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,040
because it doesn't

733
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,100
it is on a measuring stand

734
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,300
if you're going to hit it

735
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,900
it's going to knock it into another gauge

736
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,900
Can't hit

737
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,100
That energy is too much

738
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,800
The impact of Huotong is impossible to hit

739
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,900
Of course if you add a lot of force

740
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,400
add some extra power

741
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,800
you will destroy it

742
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,300
But you can't do it on the platform

743
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,700
It is expressed as this scale

744
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:24,100
Then you usually apply a small voltage and current

745
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
it just kept running

746
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,600
it doesn't

747
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,500
it won't go in

748
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,300
In fact, it has been proved by this experiment

749
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:37,100
They have done it with a national laboratory in the US

750
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,300
What I did was pass the current through the super tower

751
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,700
flushed it for probably years

752
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,200
That current is always running

753
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,300
it works

754
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,400
The current starts to take you away from the battery

755
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,700
the current keeps running

756
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,300
it won't stop

757
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,500
After running for several years

758
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
they turn off

759
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,400
because it has no

760
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,200
I think I'm a little slow on this

761
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Oops

762
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,320
What about the electron?

763
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,800
His other direction is that he doesn't like external magnetic fields

764
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,920
he will cause

765
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,880
Negative forces in different directions

766
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,520
Then he went up

767
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,440
This wisdom spin will be more than the next wisdom spin

768
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
just if you have

769
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,760
some time to dance

770
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
more men than women

771
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,880
What are some men doing?

772
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,200
will be smashed over there

773
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,760
Ah, this is troublesome

774
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,840
so they don't like

775
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,480
Then when you add a magnetic field

776
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,800
don't like

777
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
what about this

778
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,840
So there is the phenomenon of word service

779
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,120
this is a magnetic field

780
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,280
This is a superconductor

781
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,240
magnetic field

782
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,040
This magnet will hang

783
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,240
magnetic fields he doesn't like magnetic fields

784
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,480
he gets rid of him

785
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,520
You see this is a new phenomenon

786
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,600
none of us expected

787
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,240
This is very smart

788
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,800
If he doesn't like him, get rid of him

789
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,200
Exhaust the magnetism to the outside

790
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,280
he floated

791
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,880
Then this one is called Massner

792
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,200
Well, this is actually very reasonable and simple

793
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,960
Now we understand that it is simple

794
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,720
it's simple

795
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,400
Farrati's law

796
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,960
because you added a magnetic field

797
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,080
he will generate electricity

798
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
Current is in the opposite direction to magnetic field

799
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,840
everybody knows

800
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,120
This is Landrow

801
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,920
in that direction

802
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,280
It will shield its magnetic field

803
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,200
Of course it's normal here

804
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,880
Why can't normal iron

805
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,600
Ordinary metal won't

806
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,520
because normal metals are

807
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,720
current will be gone

808
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,560
With resistance

809
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,760
Disappear under current

810
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,160
But this is superconducting

811
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,080
it won't

812
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,720
So the superconductor will always have a current

813
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,000
keep it blocked

814
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,120
so it will float with great force

815
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,280
of course this is

816
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,400
just said

817
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
This is Massiness

818
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,200
But if you then increase the magnetic field

819
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,280
it can't get rid of

820
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,160
too strong

821
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,920
what about it

822
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,480
it puts it in

823
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,200
how does it go in

824
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,160
it puts it in like a gold grid

825
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,880
it confines it to a small place

826
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,720
That dark place over here has a magnetic field

827
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,520
There is no magnetic field outside

828
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,760
This is what they calculate

829
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,320
This Apricot of the Landrow speaks for itself

830
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,440
because it lifts the math

831
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,900
This is called vortex rolling out

832
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,900
show inside

833
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,400
It has a magnetic field inside

834
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,500
The outside is shielded

835
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,700
OK

836
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,000
so it was very successful

837
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Received the Nobel Prize in 2003

838
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,100
This result is of course the result of the experiment at the beginning.

839
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,500
very amazing

840
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
it will line it up nicely

841
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,200
this is us to show this

842
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,700
The one just mentioned was an experiment.

843
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,200
oh

844
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,600
I obviously can't do it here

845
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,200
oops

846
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,600
I'll stop now

847
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,700
this is a bit troublesome

848
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,800
I was going to show how it lined up

849
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,200
but i think i might have to hold it up

850
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,400
But there may not be enough time now

851
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,500
let me tell you

852
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,400
there's something special in here

853
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
What I just said

854
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,500
Talking about this nest

855
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,200
talk like this

856
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,600
What about each of these things?

857
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,000
Actually you

858
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
You see it's neatly arranged

859
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
But everyone has a fixed unit

860
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,600
all the same size

861
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,800
The black dots are all the same size

862
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,300
Then this is called a special quantum magnetic flux

863
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,900
It has a certain unit

864
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,000
what about this unit

865
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,700
Planck Conson

866
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,500
Double the pad box

867
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,300
Twice the pad box is Couple Pair

868
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,400
Couple Pair is two pad boxes

869
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
two chia

870
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,300
so two

871
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
It is H except these two pad boxes

872
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,500
It is called a standard Flux mine

873
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,700
it everyone

874
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,100
The black dot I just saw

875
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,000
this is the point

876
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Then there is no magnetic field in the middle

877
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,900
magnetic field in

878
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,700
get in the middle of it

879
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,500
next to the current

880
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,700
put this magnetic field

881
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,400
The magnetic field in the middle is gone

882
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
only in a small area

883
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,600
you can't even imagine

884
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
this natural world is wonderful

885
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,400
This mat seems to have a brand

886
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
Actually it doesn't have Brand

887
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,100
But it doesn't hurt well, it will find a way by itself

888
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,680
Shrink this magnetic field to a very small distance

889
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,740
it does not affect

890
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,580
So most of the place has no magnetic field

891
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,280
It did not affect the steering

892
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,640
steer it's still there

893
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
will not be affected by it

894
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,080
only a few places

895
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,880
This is the best rounding signal

896
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,000
think about it

897
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,080
it's just incredible

898
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,180
it will find your best solution by itself

899
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,080
Let this rounding information exist

900
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,040
that this is very small

901
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,500
but the thing is it's fun

902
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,580
It must have integers likewise

903
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,820
This is a quantity effect

904
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,020
It's not another effect

905
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,820
it must be an integer

906
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,020
not an integer not yet

907
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:36,920
you can count

908
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,020
You can count the one just now

909
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,120
Carrying the Triangular Ginger is fine

910
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,320
But it must be an integer

911
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,720
but you can ask

912
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,820
Then why do I want integers

913
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,220
I can apply a magnetic field from the outside

914
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,260
I added a magnetic field outside

915
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,480
any magnetic field

916
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,880
I don't have to be that

917
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,680
The multiple of the magnetic flux just now

918
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,920
multiples of integers

919
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,080
I can do it 1⁴ can I

920
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,780
1⁹ more

921
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,080
Then if more than 1⁹

922
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,640
In fact, there are two possible solutions

923
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,600
One is that your superconductor produces a clockwise current

924
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
add one-half to one

925
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,280
generate a current

926
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
The current starts to run

927
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,600
add one-half

928
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,000
One-half plus one-half becomes one

929
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,800
curious

930
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,600
But I can run in reverse

931
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
becomes minus one-half

932
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,600
One-half plus minus one-half becomes zero

933
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,000
I can also be zero

934
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,200
I have two possibilities

935
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
one running forward

936
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
a reverse run

937
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,600
One becomes one and one becomes zero

938
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
it's okay

939
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,800
It suits my condition just now

940
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,200
It must be an integer multiple

941
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,200
That is, if you insist on adding half a magnetic head to measure it in

942
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
it can also

943
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,600
It can increase the amount of head

944
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,400
it becomes like this

945
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,200
but who is right in the end

946
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
Is it one or two

947
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,400
The answer is both and neither

948
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,000
the answer is

949
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,200
Learn to be a cat

950
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,800
That is, everyone scanned the superposition state of the two states

951
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
is its answer

952
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,200
This is Quantum Mechanics

953
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,400
most amazing place

954
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
This answer is also this year

955
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,340
Did you talk about it?

956
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,180
This is to learn to determine a Rams, whether it is one or zero, alive or dead

957
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,220
You don't know either, both are possible, and both are falling prices

958
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,980
This is used to make Flox, quantum qubit

959
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,220
Everyone knows that computers need to use this quantum bit

960
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,740
The qubit, if calculated by Flox, is made like this

961
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,840
As I said just now, there are superconductors here

962
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:30,340
Then you have to pass through inside, the magnetic momentum must pass through, it must be an integer number

963
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,120
I didn't talk about it just now, so it must be an integer

964
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,520
In it it can do the Flox qubit

965
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,840
Then if you say, if two qubits are placed next to each other today

966
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,020
I only put a magnetic momentum into it

967
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:50,520
It's one is one on the left and zero on the right, or one on the right and zero on the left

968
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,980
it only has two possibilities, right

969
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,920
It is impossible for both to be one and zero at the same time

970
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,760
Zero and one, because put one in

971
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,000
What is the sum of these two? This is this year's

972
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,880
I don't want to appeal

973
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,720
This is today's entanglement

974
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,160
this proof

975
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,000
If you put these two

976
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,960
These two Q ratios are far apart

977
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,400
it's still the same

978
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,840
If you measure to one

979
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,360
The other side must be zero

980
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,560
because zero is one

981
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,440
this is very simple

982
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,320
But this is beyond

983
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,160
Of course, today's quantum computers

984
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,520
Mainly use super to body

985
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,760
I won't talk about this anymore

986
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,360
But this PCS theory

987
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,760
is a giant quantum effect

988
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,960
However, some of the original properties are no longer displayed

989
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,080
only group sex

990
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,880
So what I said just now is the behavior of groups

991
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,240
Neither one or two electronic acts

992
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,160
All electrons do these things

993
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,800
Do together

994
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,280
that's a strange thing

995
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,880
but it is very beautiful

996
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,840
sexual behavior

997
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,640
but in it

998
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,600
Of course there are bigger problems

999
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,160
is it possible for you to say

1000
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,840
There is a Coopers Pass formed

1001
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,680
have no homology

1002
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,920
it's too strong

1003
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,800
Just now I said that I am in a team, so I have no electrons

1004
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,800
Can't I form a team first without having the same article?

1005
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,700
As I said earlier, if the room is large, many people will dance

1006
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,600
The people over here have already started to dance, but the people over there haven't danced yet

1007
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,800
Then there is no same article

1008
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,300
Some people dance here at different paces

1009
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,500
Someone is different here, different on both sides

1010
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,500
That has CooperPet , but no conformity

1011
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,500
Then there is no way to become a non-electric group.

1012
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,200
It's not over-falling, then this phenomenon has never been seen before.

1013
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,500
But in this 1987

1014
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,300
These two Gentlemen in October

1015
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,900
In September, there was PayFer

1016
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,800
It's going to be a very exciting start to November with a new super-down

1017
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,400
After that, Wu Maokun and I found YBCO

1018
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,600
They were the first to look for it, and they won the Nobel Prize in the second year

1019
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,400
ok it's very early

1020
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,600
As early as the second year, the material was brought out to talk about it.

1021
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,200
This is the high-level conductor

1022
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,600
At that time, of course, there was another important

1023
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,500
I also went to participate

1024
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,900
I don't know if Mei Yini went there at that time

1025
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,000
At the March Meeting in New York in 1987

1026
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,300
I will go to participate

1027
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,800
it was 12 o'clock in the evening

1028
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,000
it's 12 o'clock at night

1029
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,700
crazy for physicists

1030
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,800
in the squeeze

1031
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,500
There is still a meeting at 12 o'clock in the evening

1032
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,800
It's been a day

1033
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,700
I still have to go to the crowded hall to give a speech tonight.

1034
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,900
About Gawain

1035
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
This is WooStar

1036
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,800
WooStar is chasing hot singers in the past

1037
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,200
star party

1038
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,400
At that time we also did

1039
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,200
Then why am I talking about this?

1040
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,600
This is the Gawain conductor

1041
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,200
there is a special phenomenon

1042
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,100
It's supposed to be a special material

1043
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,300
time it should be a strong force

1044
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,100
it was supposed to be a conductor

1045
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,200
Turns out it's an insulator

1046
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,700
Then this picture is a

1047
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,400
In fact, this picture is too complicated

1048
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,000
I won't drop you either

1049
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
but i just want to tell you

1050
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
This picture is from a review in 2003

1051
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Talk about the picture at that time

1052
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
At that time they thought that high temperature superconductivity should look like this

1053
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
but now this half

1054
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They only showed half of it, it's too complicated

1055
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
By 2017, this phase diagram has become much more complicated than this

1056
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
High-temperature superconductivity is always a very complicated phenomenon

1057
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
keeps appearing

1058
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
so far there are

1059
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But the most interesting is the question

1060
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
in this state

1061
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It seems to have cried, but it is not superconducting

1062
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
superconducting below this not superconducting above this

1063
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Non-superconducting states do exist

1064
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I just cried

1065
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that's what i just said

1066
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
it already has a pair

1067
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Then here I just show some measurement results

1068
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
What about their materials?

1069
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It uses STM

1070
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
STM is a needle tip of my electric current

1071
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Like a tip, when I pass a voltage, there will be a current

1072
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The change in current follows the change in voltage

1073
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
You can see how the electrons on this surface

1074
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,720
how different electronic states

1075
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,560
like here

1076
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,360
it goes from here to here

1077
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,240
its electronic state is changing

1078
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,240
With voltage

1079
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,760
So the current is changing

1080
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,680
What about this state?

1081
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,000
it shows

1082
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,120
you have two electrons here

1083
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
Positron

1084
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,720
it has flaws

1085
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,160
This this Calsium

1086
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,200
cover is two

1087
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,920
Usually it sends two electrons

1088
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,200
but if you are defective

1089
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,400
it becomes two less

1090
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,000
put two electrons

1091
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,560
Just two positive boxes

1092
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,560
There are two positive boxes near this

1093
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,280
Two positive boxes become

1094
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,720
look like this

1095
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,320
so it this is

1096
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:35,960
What about the experiment?

1097
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,040
is showing

1098
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,280
I just put two electric boxes in it

1099
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,480
you will form

1100
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,760
It seems that a very strange shape is at the entrance of the building

1101
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,840
Then if you put two pairs

1102
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,200
it will form more complex phenomena

1103
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,600
Its two pairs will layer horizontally into one large

1104
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,480
what if i have 12 pairs today

1105
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,200
put it all together

1106
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,400
what have you become

1107
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,840
if i have 10

1108
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,600
ten times right?

1109
00:48:59,600 --> 00:48:59,960
ten targets

1110
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
20 squares right?

1111
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
but you will suffer

1112
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
but no homology

1113
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
it's already bitter

1114
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
but no homology

1115
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
This is the result of the experiment

1116
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
why show this

1117
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
is when you put 10 to 20 squares

1118
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
you realize

1119
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Wow

1120
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
it's arranged in a special shape

1121
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's inside the building

1122
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
with these bitter pairs

1123
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
but it doesn't necessarily have the same

1124
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
There is zero electricity

1125
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
that's a new phenomenon

1126
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It turns out that the BCS theory doesn't fit well again.

1127
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
totally different story

1128
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
What about this story?

1129
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
important modern research

1130
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
then this is to tell you

1131
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's more complicated than we thought

1132
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
real emerging behavior

1133
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
more

1134
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I just talked a little bit about it

1135
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That high-security has been developed for 36 years and has been used continuously

1136
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
the most important reason

1137
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Its electronic construction is very strong

1138
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
with a lot of new emerging behavior

1139
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
As I just said, there are new ones every year

1140
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
still not finished

1141
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,600
You haven't finished frying this material, there are too many new things

1142
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,000
Then we don't find out what to do

1143
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,900
The above theories are all top-down

1144
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,600
that's what i just said

1145
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,300
we have basic couple pair

1146
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,500
Just this idea superconducting

1147
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,700
Then I go like this

1148
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,000
try to apply it to more complex phenomena

1149
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,100
But some are successful and some are not

1150
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,900
OK

1151
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:29,100
The other is to say

1152
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,600
it's us

1153
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,800
That is, we work from the bottom up

1154
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,900
just look at the data

1155
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,700
the most famous example

1156
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,800
I now give this example

1157
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,000
Take the example of the flock of birds just now

1158
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,600
how do physicists understand it

1159
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,800
do the dumbest way

1160
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,100
take pictures

1161
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,000
take a quick photo

1162
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,900
when every bird is flying

1163
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,300
what is its direction

1164
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,300
it is the direction of velocity

1165
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:54,600
OK

1166
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,800
this is speed

1167
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,200
then its direction

1168
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,200
Take the image volume of this speed and put it

1169
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,440
Find out, and then ask whether these two directions are related

1170
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,900
just do this

1171
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,800
Because of this matter, the data is analyzed, and then a model is fit

1172
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,100
The model is like this, only these two quantities

1173
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,940
For example, for each bird, there are about eight birds beside it

1174
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,740
This NC is good, let's say eight are good

1175
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,100
Ask about the relationship between the eight birds next to it and it

1176
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,740
Then you do it, just write it as a simple model

1177
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,440
They did it and it turned out to be

1178
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,200
this professor did

1179
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,800
Let’s talk about that APS

1180
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,600
This work is very beautiful, after finishing

1181
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,500
This is too simple, more simple idea

1182
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,300
I just go to fit

1183
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,200
Turns out the bird-to-bird relatedness is a borderline

1184
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,100
Just now I have talked about what is called the critical state, in the middle of two phases

1185
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,100
they're on edge

1186
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,500
This is of course, why he is on edge, no one knows

1187
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,300
but he's on edge

1188
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,600
And it's a very beautiful critical state

1189
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,400
this is a very interesting

1190
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But the state of this part is of course the most important reason, we can explain it with this iron pool

1191
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Everyone knows that iron pools are magnetic at low temperatures

1192
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But at high temperature, if you raise the iron pool to high temperature, there will be no magnetism

1193
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Each magnetic transition up or down

1194
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
like we say one or minus one

1195
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
You can down and up be one plus one or minus one

1196
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
But if you are in very high temperature

1197
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Each magnetic spin can be up or down at will

1198
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
so it adds up to zero

1199
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
when you're cold

1200
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Each magnetic spin tries to be the same as the one next to it

1201
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
These two have the same lower energy

1202
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
These two are different, the energy is higher

1203
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
it doesn't like

1204
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
so it likes to be with it

1205
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Then this is Ice in model

1206
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
This is a very simple model

1207
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
called the Ice in magnetic spin model

1208
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So everyone in the literature has probably learned this

1209
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
up or down

1210
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Then this model it is very simple

1211
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
There's a weird thing about this model

1212
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
You can imagine black going up and white going down

1213
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Then this is a very messy and disorderly image.

1214
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
But at low temperature

1215
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
What about when it's cold?

1216
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
it will be more and more like it will be

1217
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
more and more white

1218
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
There will be fewer and fewer black pictures like this one

1219
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Of course, there may be more and more black

1220
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
less and less white

1221
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
but it's all possible

1222
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
But when you are at part temperature

1223
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
will find a strange phenomenon

1224
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
it's not much white

1225
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
less black

1226
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
White, black, not much difference

1227
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
but

1228
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
it's always big

1229
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
The white one is also big

1230
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
The black one is also big

1231
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
There is black in the middle of the white

1232
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
The black ones look carefully and there are white ones inside

1233
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
become complicated

1234
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's different from the low temperature

1235
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Of course it's not the same as high temperature

1236
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,940
Each independent black and white is completely random

1237
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,060
Then this phenomenon can be explained

1238
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,900
And it was Ansack who explained it back then.

1239
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,980
This is in the middle of order and disorder

1240
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,500
In this zero-medium state neither is the case

1241
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,300
It's not what I just said

1242
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,020
It is also not ordered in the middle of two

1243
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,660
it's right in the middle right here at this point

1244
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,860
The disordered direction means zero on average at high temperature

1245
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,580
because half up and half down

1246
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,660
the odds are the same

1247
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:33,180
But at low temperatures almost all upward

1248
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,100
you're not so sure at this temperature

1249
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,700
it's up some up

1250
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,740
so it's not a special

1251
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,420
right at the boundary of the two faces

1252
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:46,340
it looks like both up and down

1253
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,780
but it's not quite

1254
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,460
it's a strange state

1255
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,180
Then this strange state is a state of concealing the mirror

1256
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,540
Then of course it is here

1257
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,900
If you look at the correlation distance

1258
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,140
Associated functions Both are associated functions

1259
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,400
Usually there is an association distance

1260
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,100
There is no association beyond the association distance

1261
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,800
But low temperature and high temperature have a correlation distance

1262
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,200
But there is no correlation distance at midnight temperature

1263
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,400
The association distance is infinite

1264
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,300
that this is very interesting

1265
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,400
This first one, this math is of course a bit

1266
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,200
If you know that this is in the form of an exponential

1267
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,800
Then this is when Tc

1268
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,100
it is density

1269
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,000
ok

1270
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,900
it is density

1271
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,400
it has no size

1272
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,600
fractal

1273
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,900
It behaves completely differently

1274
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,500
I just said that the flock of birds is in this phenomenon.

1275
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,600
I'll get to this quickly now

1276
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,200
The biggest problem is that there are a lot of

1277
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,500
special phenomenon

1278
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Just at this Tc time

1279
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,900
It becomes infinite in many things

1280
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,400
If an infinite system

1281
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,500
not infinite system

1282
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,800
it gets big

1283
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,800
Then I will summarize it

1284
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,800
just talked too much

1285
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,000
Maybe everyone will be the first to have a meal reserve

1286
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,800
at high temperature it is not

1287
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,700
Infinity at low temperature

1288
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,000
it is

1289
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,720
Ordered and disordered in the middle to an intermediate state in the middle

1290
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,600
This state is a special state

1291
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,400
Then this state is an emerging state

1292
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,440
It's not surprising that everyone goes up

1293
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,720
like we have spin

1294
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,400
two just two together

1295
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,680
he also likes to go up

1296
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,960
So not too new emerging station

1297
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,640
It's not unusual to turn around

1298
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,880
there are many words

1299
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,800
Of course there are some who don't like to go up

1300
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,920
he goes up

1301
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,000
but at high temperature

1302
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,080
stand in this position

1303
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,000
he's weird

1304
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,840
His association training is infinite

1305
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,120
he has no distance

1306
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,560
That is to say, you are in the ratio of one centimeter to two centimeters

1307
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,840
The ratio of one meter to two meters

1308
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,000
100km is the same as 200km

1309
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,440
OK

1310
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,720
he makes no difference

1311
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,280
he doesn't care how far you are

1312
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,760
his mutual size

1313
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,920
all the same size

1314
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,320
So this is what I just said

1315
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,920
Fractal Self-Similarity

1316
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,000
that question

1317
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,240
let's talk

1318
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,080
The question I was going to talk about today

1319
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,880
Pity

1320
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,000
to talk about this mind

1321
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,100
so big, and the cerebellum has so many neurons

1322
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,000
how do we understand

1323
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,600
That's all Guoyi's mind is

1324
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,900
how do we understand

1325
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,100
How to understand the brain?

1326
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,200
Of course someone made one

1327
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,800
I'll talk a little bit quickly

1328
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,100
did an experiment

1329
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,200
how to do it

1330
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,400
this is an interesting experiment

1331
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,300
Everyone knows to use VR to play

1332
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,000
when game play

1333
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,400
But the New York Science of Physicists

1334
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,200
It is used to show the old

1335
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,600
This VR video

1336
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,300
make him think he's running outside

1337
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,600
In fact, the old man is running on this ball

1338
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,100
But he has a camera on his head

1339
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:41,600
Can videotape his brain lights up

1340
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,500
lights up when he sees something

1341
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,400
Showed him some illusions

1342
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,900
He has been running and watching

1343
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,100
Then the brain keeps recording

1344
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,100
It's an amazing experiment

1345
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,700
beautifully done

1346
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,900
You didn't expect to do such a beautiful experiment

1347
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,700
He looks at the brain

1348
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,600
What does it have to do with what he saw?

1349
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,000
This is

1350
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,900
data to be tested

1351
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,200
data we make

1352
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,300
I made it very simple with a professor

1353
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,400
very cheap

1354
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,600
Put a small camera on the head of the mouse

1355
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,600
Called Mini scope

1356
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,700
So it was Professor Wu Dongchuan who worked at China Medical University

1357
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,000
then give him a

1358
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,200
run inside the barracks

1359
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,000
You see he's selling too

1360
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,800
so we can keep track of which cowherds are selling

1361
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,600
Which cowherds are selling

1362
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,500
we have data

1363
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,200
Just like this is a very delicate matter

1364
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,500
This is a very famous thing

1365
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,400
This is probably Cadillac

1366
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,500
This is probably a cheap car

1367
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,200
this is

1368
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,200
this result

1369
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,300
the result we made

1370
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:38,900
I don't talk anymore

1371
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,400
just to tell you yes

1372
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,200
What we end up with is almost the same

1373
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,000
is found

1374
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,300
in these phenomena

1375
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,900
see the experiment

1376
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,900
are in Critical state

1377
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,600
are near the critical temperature

1378
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,500
That is, the temperature of the experiment is T1

1379
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,800
the temperature of the experiment

1380
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,100
But we use this to analyze

1381
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Other data we found that it is almost all in the part temperature

1382
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,300
This is very complicated data made with others

1383
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,700
It's the same for others to do very complex data

1384
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:16,500
What we do is a very simple debut of the data

1385
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,600
But the answer is almost exactly the same

1386
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
This is a very interesting phenomenon

1387
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,000
This phenomenon doesn't make much sense from physics.

1388
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,400
If the part phenomenon

1389
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,400
It's not quite Depend on detail

1390
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,200
Many details are not important

1391
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,600
It only cares about some important parameters of this long distance

1392
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:43,200
Here we use very debut measurements and very precise measurements

1393
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,400
In the end the answer is that all the rats are running around here

1394
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:57,300
His brain behaves as if he cares about the pie of some parts

1395
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,100
Why is it important to be there

1396
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,540
This is of course a lot of RESET below us doing this problem

1397
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,460
But at least this is an interesting phenomenon

1398
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,500
before our eyes

1399
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,540
Then this is a show

1400
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,040
You didn't expect such a simple question

1401
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,340
unexpectedly get such a strange result

1402
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:25,040
But my conclusion is that when the elemental effect becomes very strong in a large group

1403
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,080
New Emergy behavior becomes

1404
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:33,240
These behaviors often require new laws and principles

1405
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:39,540
That's of course what I'm quoting is the supervisors

1406
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,040
PW Anderson

1407
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,980
He died two years ago and this is the Nubai Prize winner.

1408
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,340
his proposed book

1409
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,340
Paper, The More is Different

1410
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,340
If you go Beyond Nature

1411
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,980
Nature has a Hierarchist Structure Science

1412
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,640
Science does not mean that you are always the most basic

1413
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,640
You will know all about Science

1414
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,500
layer by layer structure

1415
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
Layer by layer the phenomenon is different

1416
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Need different principles to explain

1417
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,000
Here are a few questions I just raised

1418
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,500
In fact, to tell everyone

1419
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,500
Turns out what we know isn't quite resolved

1420
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,700
there is always something new

1421
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,200
Of course every complex phenomenon

1422
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,000
Of course I want life science now

1423
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
understand this more and more

1424
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
This phenomenon occurs in many life sciences

1425
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,500
So it turns out that the simplest phenomenon we understand

1426
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,000
it has a new law

1427
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
new dogma

1428
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
new principle

1429
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
This is with new rules

1430
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
That's why of course

1431
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
More and more

1432
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Those who do physics have to run in

1433
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,500
research life sciences

1434
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,000
because this is new rules

1435
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
new laws

1436
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Then this emerging behavior

1437
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
It's not what we imagined

1438
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
The stronger the force

1439
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I just talked about scientific issues

1440
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
If you think about it, think about human beings

1441
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,600
All the problems I just mentioned have arisen

1442
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,000
Our role is also getting stronger

1443
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The role of people and people in today's world

1444
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,600
And the range distance is getting stronger and stronger

1445
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,000
Of course it's because of the phone

1446
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
this Internet problem

1447
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
we can talk to people very far

1448
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Many people act at the same time

1449
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
and it's very powerful

1450
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
what does long mean

1451
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It's just that you have a lot of leftover information

1452
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
very fast

1453
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
information is power

1454
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I didn't say it just now

1455
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
In fact, the scope of the cowherd just mentioned

1456
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
all mean the same thing

1457
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The force we are talking about is between the residual information

1458
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
information interacts with each other

1459
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
These data will generate a large

1460
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
new human activity

1461
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
There will be many new behaviors appearing

1462
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
in human society

1463
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
This is something we haven't encountered before

1464
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Because previous human information

1465
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
are limited to small

1466
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
it's different now

1467
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
completely changed the human

1468
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,380
This activity is actually

1469
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,580
So now sociology has become very interesting

1470
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,900
It is no longer the old sociology

1471
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,740
Because the emerging behavior may become a

1472
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:12,180
quite important phenomenon

1473
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,180
thank you all

1474
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,880
ok then thank you very much

1475
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,580
Such a brilliant speech by Academician Li

1476
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:32,820
We are now open to ask questions

1477
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,920
The first 10 viewers who asked questions

1478
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,400
Chinese medicine hospital is ready

1479
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,420
a beautiful gift

1480
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:42,360
for everyone

1481
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,400
so please don't be shy

1482
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,500
if there is a problem

1483
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,000
please raise your hand

1484
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,160
so hands can

1485
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,840
The staff can hand over the microphone to everyone

1486
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,860
this one here first

1487
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,040
The strong force of the teacher

1488
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:10,400
Is the strong force you mentioned related to the injury we usually talk about?

1489
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:11,640
heel injury

1490
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,240
right

1491
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,300
Injury is not necessarily related to force

1492
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,840
But the injury refers to its degree of freedom or its degree of chaos

1493
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,200
What I just said has something to do with injuries.

1494
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,760
But it's not directly related to force

1495
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,720
Strong force does not necessarily mean serious injury

1496
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,460
Sometimes the strong force is what you think should be imagined

1497
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,360
For example, two cushions are kept together

1498
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,160
can't run around

1499
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,460
So the injury is reduced

1500
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,160
right

1501
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,500
But if there are many times

1502
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,260
Not necessarily when it comes out with a new feature

1503
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,060
So this has nothing to do with the injury directly.

1504
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:57,460
I don't know what you just said is also an interesting question

1505
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,960
injury related to injury

1506
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,360
you know

1507
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,060
With such a strong force, the injury may actually be less

1508
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:06,060
Because of yours, some of our little Internet celebrities are very powerful

1509
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:09,600
How much does an Internet celebrity talk about and how many people it immediately affects

1510
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,860
Many people followed it, so it actually hurt less

1511
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:16,400
ok second place at the end

1512
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,400
Professor Li, I just heard that

1513
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,600
There are electronic teams formed and then there is a coordination mechanism

1514
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,600
tidal conduction

1515
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,200
Tide guide phenomenon, then I would like to ask about this coordination mechanism

1516
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,700
It is also seen that when the electronic team is confined to one place

1517
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:40,400
It may not be able to form a tidal guide, so is there any way for us to get from this state

1518
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,300
use it as a coordinated Is there a way to make a coordinated mechanism

1519
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,500
Then let it return to a tidal state like this

1520
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,700
That is how we observe this coordinated phenomenon

1521
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,200
That's my problem, thanks

1522
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,900
Of course there are many ways to deal with this phenomenon

1523
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,800
I didn't have time to talk about it just now because high tide conduction is complicated.

1524
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,100
but it actually

1525
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,600
So this theory is now accepted by most people

1526
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:08,800
I found that a Couper Pair has been formed but there is no guidance

1527
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,800
Just like the experimental results I showed just now, the results are very certain.

1528
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,600
It already has a Couper Pair but it doesn't have a coupe

1529
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:19,800
But how to become a coordination problem is very complicated

1530
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,000
what you wrote is a good question

1531
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
That's what everyone is thinking about

1532
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,400
just now I didn't have time to explain

1533
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,000
just like dancing

1534
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,200
just use this dance to explain

1535
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,000
For example, at the beginning there is music here

1536
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,600
some jumping over here

1537
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,400
below there are some over there

1538
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,000
they may not be coordinated

1539
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,700
have been inconsistent

1540
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:40,800
because he can dance his

1541
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,900
he dances his

1542
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,400
But if a multiplayer jump starts in the middle

1543
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,600
When everyone dances together and connects together

1544
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,900
that becomes more and more coordinated

1545
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,800
Not enough questions don't bump into each other

1546
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,100
push each other up

1547
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,400
Then start coordinating

1548
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,200
In fact, this human being has many things

1549
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,000
For example, if you take a picture, everyone takes random pictures

1550
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,960
When many people shoot together, after a while it becomes very coordinated

1551
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,800
This is the evidence of many experiments

1552
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,560
is the coordination

1553
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,560
But in the real material

1554
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,000
how do you coordinate

1555
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,760
It's actually quite difficult

1556
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,760
It's a matter of directing the coordination

1557
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,660
has always been an important issue

1558
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:27,160
But pretty much hasn't been figured out a good way

1559
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,760
Then we coordinate when we see coordination

1560
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,220
uncoordinated uncoordinated

1561
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:36,960
But some people will become more coordinated at low temperature

1562
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,520
Uncoordinated high temperature

1563
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,520
It's about business

1564
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,120
it's about business

1565
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:49,320
this is another question

1566
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,320
ok the gentleman is in the middle

1567
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,600
Hello Yueshi

1568
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:06,800
I just saw you mentioned the experiment you conducted

1569
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,200
Just watch a VR with a mouse

1570
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,000
Then there is control over him

1571
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,800
not me doing the experiment

1572
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,600
That's someone else's experiment

1573
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:12,400
just like China

1574
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,300
We experimented with a professor

1575
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:19,400
It's a mouse with a little microscope on its head

1576
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,400
in that mini school

1577
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,600
micro school

1578
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,600
mini micro school

1579
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,000
I'm curious

1580
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,200
In the end you concluded that

1581
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,000
He is also in a critical state

1582
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,400
Then his parameters

1583
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,000
looks like

1584
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,400
Other parameters

1585
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,800
The parameters of the belly of that picture

1586
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,200
What is the x-axis and y-axis

1587
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,200
Then how to conclude that

1588
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,800
he is in a critical state

1589
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,200
I think this is quite interesting

1590
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,900
here

1591
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,300
you say

1592
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:46,600
no

1593
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,800
Because we're going to put the experimental numbers

1594
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,500
I just didn't have time to talk

1595
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,200
you asked

1596
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,300
i can talk

1597
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,800
is the number we put in the experiment

1598
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,800
use a model to

1599
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,400
fit it

1600
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,400
In fact, the same as before

1601
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,900
Anyway, you gave me the experimental data

1602
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,260
I use the simplest model

1603
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,200
I want to get the simplest model

1604
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,960
go fit it

1605
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:05,800
can you fit

1606
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,600
The answer is that it can fit well

1607
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,100
Then I can find a model

1608
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,440
Then I ask the model now

1609
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,600
if i have model

1610
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,560
I can use it as a physical model

1611
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,700
I can put assuming a hypothetical temperature

1612
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,140
Put the fake temperature in

1613
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,200
I'll do the math

1614
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,640
Various phenomena in this model

1615
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:22,700
then i realize

1616
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,200
how can it have a phase

1617
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,200
as if distinguishing

1618
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,360
Of course it doesn't really look like

1619
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:29,300
Because it's not a big system

1620
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,660
For example, we only have 8 or 90

1621
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:35,200
Neuroblasts are not millions

1622
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,100
so few systems

1623
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,100
But at least we see a big

1624
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:43,860
This is the PIC

1625
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,900
that's what we figured out

1626
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:50,260
Its slope is the largest here

1627
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:52,800
It is also the largest near T.1

1628
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,860
so this is weird

1629
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:56,100
this seems to be a coincidence

1630
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,300
because there is so much space

1631
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,500
it can be found here

1632
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,100
T.1 is the experimental data

1633
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,400
Come in fitting is used to mention

1634
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,000
When we extend it

1635
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,600
We found out why the experimental data is not here

1636
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,000
Why must it be here on the biggest peak

1637
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,600
Why are you at Dafeng?

1638
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,800
Actually it's not necessary

1639
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,600
this is a very strange thing

1640
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Of course I'm talking about this

1641
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,600
we're not the first to do it

1642
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,200
What people do is more fine-grained data

1643
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,800
They also found this phenomenon

1644
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,900
This phenomenon becomes very special

1645
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,900
Why do these mouse neurons

1646
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:32,900
From what we see he likes to be on this peak

1647
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,300
In fact, he can be in any

1648
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,100
Why does he have to be on this peak

1649
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,400
Of course this is the most important question

1650
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,600
Physically speaking

1651
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,900
Such a simple model is not very complicated

1652
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,300
I just said that in fact

1653
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,900
Mostly like the flock of birds

1654
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:49,600
looks so complicated

1655
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,100
but they can predict very well

1656
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:54,300
In fact they can also do dynamic

1657
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
prediction of time

1658
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:57,500
all work

1659
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,600
just can't figure it out

1660
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,760
Model Actually, I think if you know this

1661
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,800
Chinese and American professors already know

1662
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:06,900
That is the classical Heisenberg model

1663
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:12,000
That work can't believe why he works so well

1664
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,800
and things in nature

1665
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,600
Then why does he work so well

1666
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,600
surprise

1667
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,400
the lady

1668
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,000
Basic This Electron to Thermal Group

1669
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,900
And finally to the animal group, the human group

1670
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,400
Then we often use

1671
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,100
you from the couple effect

1672
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:43,600
to this highest this

1673
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,700
The collective behavior you are talking about

1674
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,700
There are some in the middle called Cui Xing

1675
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,600
also steady state

1676
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,200
Can you use a very simple sentence between this

1677
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,400
string it on force

1678
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,400
From a point of view of force

1679
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,000
Look at such a collective behavior

1680
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
forget about it

1681
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:07,000
The force must be present to have a non-transition

1682
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Without force, of course there won't be

1683
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That non transition from one boundary to another

1684
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Actually nothing has changed, right?

1685
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
A water molecule is a water molecule, a gas

1686
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Become liquid again, become solid again, become ice again

1687
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
The thing has not changed, the composition has not changed, but its shape can change

1688
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Did the force change or did not change

1689
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
In principle you can write down a force

1690
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Especially with the current calculation method, you can calculate

1691
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
But here, of course, is what I just said

1692
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
This is a question of statistical body thermodynamics

1693
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Because the exchange of injury and energy changes the harmony of each other

1694
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
you can come out in different shapes

1695
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Of course now I know this

1696
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
That is the simplest case more complicated

1697
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
many complex traps

1698
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Like I didn't have time to talk just now

1699
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Our model is actually related to last year's Nobel Prize

1700
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
This is called the Spin Glass Model.

1701
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
with last year's nobel prize winner

1702
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I spoke two or three years late

1703
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
two nobel laureates

1704
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Everything I do is related to this

1705
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
This is Zhixuan Glass Model

1706
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
that's... that's more complicated

1707
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Then it is often said here that there is no...

1708
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
that is not to say

1709
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You said that even a force can be negative energy

1710
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
That's what I've been wanting to...

1711
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
The emphasis is that the system is different

1712
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
The force is different

1713
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
ingredients if different

1714
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
You may have many new phenomena

1715
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
not what you thought

1716
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Especially when the force is stronger

1717
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
more complexity

1718
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
we already know this

1719
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
more and more clear

1720
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It has more new behaviors that you can't imagine will come out

1721
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
This phenomenon is more and more

1722
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But I think in the life sciences

1723
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
It's been happening for a long time

1724
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I have had this for a long time

1725
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
existing problems

1726
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
because of the life sciences

1727
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
In fact, I think it's all strongly correlated.

1728
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It's all a powerful system at work

1729
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
So it actually has a large

1730
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Many emerging phenomena

1731
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I still don't understand

1732
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,000
But that's the direction of research

1733
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
But this is no universal theory

1734
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
This is actually to tell you that

1735
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
No Z theory

1736
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
good lady in the back

1737
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Hello Mr. Li

1738
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's the picture on the left

1739
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's actually quite interesting

1740
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
So my question is

1741
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Here with the whole population

1742
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Nuron's threshold

1743
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
does it matter

1744
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Because Nuron's firing exceeds the threshold

1745
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Is it 0101?

1746
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That is we made a simplification

1747
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
The easiest thing for a physical person to do

1748
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
When you see a cow, turn it into a ball

1749
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,600
leave it alone

1750
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,240
But the same thing happened to us

1751
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,960
Of course what we do is in our Poverty Paper

1752
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,360
Is to use different Threshold to show

1753
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,760
no relevance

1754
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,840
at least within reason

1755
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,400
there is no correlation

1756
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:14,840
Thanks

1757
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,800
THIS ANSWER IS FULL AND VERY ROBUS

1758
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:20,560
This is what we most want to amplify in Paper

1759
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,560
very strange

1760
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,000
Why so ROBUS

1761
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,560
This is also a strange thing

1762
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,560
lady in front

1763
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,560
Thank you teacher for sharing

1764
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:37,560
I have a question

1765
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,120
I'm sorry, I'm not learning at all

1766
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,560
But in terms of deepening

1767
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,560
You mentioned that when you danced just now

1768
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,560
There are times when there is not much pairing

1769
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,960
Then I also talk about it in class

1770
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,560
When there are encounters with some electronic teams that are not paired

1771
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:50,560
he will rob others

1772
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,560
We electron orbital group two two electrons

1773
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:55,560
Of course when they rob

1774
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,560
Grab him and release him to become Free Radicals

1775
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,560
like say

1776
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,800
The leaves of the tooth iron become iron nuggets

1777
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,640
So iron becomes Free Radical

1778
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,160
It can't be a pair

1779
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,480
It will do Chain Reaction

1780
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,200
Damage caused by grinding

1781
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,400
and then finally cause some

1782
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,640
Mutual or casino tool issues

1783
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,560
But when you talk about it

1784
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,960
Squeeze it out into a UFO attitude

1785
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,400
seems positive

1786
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,800
These two are a bit

1787
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,400
Very special and comparative explanation

1788
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,360
The UFO is not where it becomes Free Radical

1789
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,480
in fact limit it

1790
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,560
only put that

1791
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,600
I just didn't have time to talk

1792
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:30,720
Inside Vortex

1793
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,800
Is there any paired electrons

1794
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,960
it won't be paired

1795
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,320
Each has its own electricity inside

1796
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,120
so it puts all those extra pairs of electrons in there

1797
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,440
The key is like that

1798
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,680
then don't run around

1799
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,360
just mess with others

1800
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,920
how smart do you see

1801
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:45,760
Your Radical

1802
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:46,840
if you make it this far

1803
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,760
you can cure

1804
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,400
right

1805
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,600
Radical

1806
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,240
don't let it run around

1807
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:52,720
and instead of us putting it in

1808
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,960
We rot it becomes a result of nature

1809
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,320
it will rot automatically

1810
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,800
don't run around

1811
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,120
Why

1812
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,000
because it runs around

1813
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,960
The resulting energy will increase and destroy the entire tire

1814
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:08,500
The whole tire is so big, so it will be limited to a certain place

1815
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
So radical can't rap

1816
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:15,240
But in life science, it will come out to do chain reaction

1817
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:20,540
Yes, it won't run out, so there are certain ways to deal with this problem on its side

1818
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:24,200
So it automatically solves it without this

1819
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:30,740
This is of course Apricotium nano, don't talk about the important place

1820
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:35,460
This is automatic, this nature will automatically give you a solution

1821
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,960
It is this electronic tire that automatically gives you a solution, which solves this problem

1822
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,960
And the solution is very beautiful, very beautiful solution to this problem

1823
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,200
No human intervention is required at all

1824
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,160
It tells you that what we now prove is the solution of the natural state

1825
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:55,660
So it's not that we invent new solutions, it doesn't, it's just that after it's poured out

1826
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:58,160
We can fully explain this solution

1827
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,160
Then this solution will tell you in the experiment

1828
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,080
Life science has a chain reaction, which is negative

1829
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,880
Life science has a...

1830
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,160
It has no pre-reaction because it cannot come out

1831
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:09,400
it's confined inside, it can't come out

1832
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,400
this is a very special place

1833
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,000
This is what Mr. Murray just said

1834
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,600
your question is very good

1835
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,640
But there is an automatic way

1836
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,520
I think the human body can do it automatically.

1837
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:21,520
How to control Ratical

1838
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,600
we have three here

1839
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,480
We are behind first, and then the second is here

1840
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Thank you academician for your speech

1841
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Then I have a few questions I want to ask the academician

1842
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
The first one is whether all substances

1843
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
There will be critical phenomena

1844
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Either the temperature is too high or the temperature is too low

1845
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It's just a matter of whether I can measure it or I can't measure it

1846
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
The second little problem is

1847
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Because you just mentioned the collective behavior of humans

1848
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
seems to be related to what you just mentioned

1849
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Clustering may be somewhat conceptual

1850
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Then my question is to ask

1851
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,400
Let things like war, plague, or famine

1852
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:05,900
Is that also a so-called critical phenomenon?

1853
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:08,400
The third question is to ask

1854
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,000
Is that as long as a certain amount is reached?

1855
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:14,500
That means there is only one bird today that we may not see

1856
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,700
That might be ten birds and I might not even see them

1857
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,700
But if I accumulate ten thousand birds

1858
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:21,700
can i see this

1859
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,700
such a group phenomenon

1860
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,800
It's like the war just now or the plague or the famine

1861
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,100
Is it that these events will eventually happen in the history of mankind?

1862
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,100
It's just that the amount we accumulate

1863
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,800
Or a certain amount of accumulation has not been reached

1864
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,800
So it just happens early or it happens late

1865
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,100
Thanks

1866
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,800
This question is the hardest to answer

1867
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,100
This question is very interesting

1868
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,100
not this question is a very good question

1869
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,400
questions we've been thinking about

1870
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,900
but it's hard to answer

1871
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:56,400
Because my problem is that our analysis now

1872
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,500
Our previous analysis method is different

1873
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,000
we don't have enough data

1874
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,100
Your problem now is with this data

1875
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,100
if we do physics

1876
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:09,600
That is to say, I don't like to think about philosophical problems casually.

1877
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,100
Then we become philosophers

1878
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,100
Physicist is what I want to see the data

1879
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:14,600
what kind of data

1880
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,200
I can analyze it like this

1881
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,700
Is this the zero line?

1882
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,600
Is your war border zero

1883
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,300
that might not be like

1884
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,000
because of aggressiveness

1885
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,700
like i think everyone

1886
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,800
our DNA may have

1887
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,400
It's a bit troublesome now

1888
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,100
this is i'm not sure yet

1889
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,400
It's a phenomenon of how many groups

1890
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,000
Or he already had this idea

1891
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,700
That’s what I said group is different from Emerging

1892
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,500
group is a phenomenon

1893
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,700
But he is not necessarily Emerging's Behavior

1894
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,100
OK, as long as he already has

1895
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,200
Say you train the army

1896
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:51,100
Everyone shoots and hits, right?

1897
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,300
He trains well by himself

1898
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:53,000
that gathers them

1899
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,600
they also do the same thing

1900
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,500
He has no Emerging behavior

1901
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,200
His Behavior is the original

1902
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,060
each individual

1903
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
and then just get together

1904
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
it's two different things

1905
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,500
What I just said is that it has a completely new phenomenon

1906
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,500
Like the superconducting invention just now, two batteries

1907
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,500
should be mutually exclusive

1908
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,000
it does not exclude

1909
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,500
Actually I didn't have time to talk just now

1910
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,000
its just the battery and

1911
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,500
A battery in the superconducting state is not the original battery

1912
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:20,000
You know that batteries and superconductivity are two different things

1913
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,000
this is totally different

1914
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
this is completely new

1915
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,500
If you use the old concept, you're screwed

1916
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:31,500
So I kept talking about new phenomena

1917
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,500
New Law new this understanding

1918
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,500
not the old way

1919
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:40,500
This point is that physics has begun to understand

1920
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,500
I think some subjects

1921
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,500
Still think it comes from reductionism

1922
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,500
can solve everything

1923
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:48,500
I think of course it is a bit difficult

1924
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:50,500
There are many problems with reductionism

1925
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,500
May be no way to use

1926
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:56,500
You can't use the reduction method

1927
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,500
use each individual

1928
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,500
I know the genes now

1929
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,600
strong association, your genome

1930
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,100
Although I know all the genes are sorted

1931
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:08,500
It's not necessarily impossible to understand genetics

1932
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,200
because they are really strongly correlated

1933
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,600
it has many new phenomena

1934
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:17,400
It's not us, you used to know everyone

1935
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,600
I think we understand this too

1936
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,200
But it's not unusual in physics

1937
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,900
so we've seen too much of this

1938
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:29,000
It's not as simple as you thought

1939
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,400
very strong

1940
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,000
but i answered your question

1941
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Because I don't remember any other questions from you.

1942
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,800
How many birds do you want

1943
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,400
That's also good question

1944
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,700
Same problem as coherence just now

1945
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:45,000
How much is the answer I don't know

1946
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,700
You have seen it with very little

1947
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:50,200
As I said just now, I only used seventy or eighty neurons

1948
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,000
I can already see that it looks like a cretial state

1949
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,700
But I dare not say it is in the cretial state

1950
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,000
because it is not infinity

1951
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,800
But its behavior has already begun to appear

1952
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,640
But from the mathematical definition

1953
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,600
you can't be so rigid by definition

1954
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,080
but physically

1955
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,800
it behaves like

1956
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,000
already too close

1957
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,200
already makes me a little uneasy

1958
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,800
Actually I see it turns out to be unsettling

1959
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,600
I don't know why there is such a result

1960
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,000
then we thought we were doing it wrong

1961
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:16,800
So we've been researching

1962
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,480
Now with more data

1963
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,200
It's an uneducated number that gives us more data

1964
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,000
the answer is the same

1965
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,600
This is of course very strange

1966
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,400
very interesting question

1967
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,480
But this I don't know

1968
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,640
don't need a lot

1969
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:31,840
OK

1970
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,920
But it takes a lot to change infinity

1971
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,640
Otherwise you can't see infinity

1972
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,080
Okay, thank you

1973
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:42,320
Just this one

1974
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,040
in the middle

1975
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,040
please raise your hand

1976
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,320
I can get you the microphone

1977
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,320
good

1978
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,680
Hello, Li Yuanshi

1979
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,480
just now i mentioned

1980
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:56,040
There will be a special coherence between Cooprope

1981
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,120
i want to ask

1982
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,120
synchronous coordination

1983
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Is this phenomenon immediate or is it a gradual behavior

1984
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:08,200
The BCX theory is immediacy

1985
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,400
so its resistance becomes 0

1986
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,200
No resistance to 0 without peers

1987
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:21,500
As soon as it reaches below tc the resistance is 0

1988
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,500
Not 0.001

1989
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,600
It's not 0.001 either

1990
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,400
it is 0

1991
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,000
OK

1992
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:31,800
no resistance

1993
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:32,600
OK

1994
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:38,000
So the question you just mentioned is that the experimental data is Mangeli

1995
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,500
But high temperature superconductivity is different.

1996
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:43,700
The high-temperature superconductivity mentioned just now is a bit embarrassing.

1997
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:48,500
Companionship and pairing are two different temperatures

1998
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,300
look first

1999
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,400
OK

2000
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,800
Then this is a different temperature

2001
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,000
Pair first, then tune

2002
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,100
But thinking about it now so it's more negative

2003
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,600
you can tell it's uneven

2004
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:07,600
its the same strip , its this dancing room

2005
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Not one hall, many small halls, many highlands, different

2006
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,600
different place

2007
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:15,400
Everybody's dancing over there, as you can imagine

2008
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,000
If there is such a scene, this dance must be very exciting

2009
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
How can I dance without being strong or...

2010
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
that's complicated

2011
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Then this, you can imagine, that is like Gao Wenchao brain

2012
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
a bit complicated

2013
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
more challenges

2014
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But it doesn't have to be the same

2015
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
It's just a pair

2016
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So it, but the theory of BCS is that pairing is the same

2017
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
ok here miss here

2018
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Hello teacher, I don't know if there is...

2019
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,160
Is there any chance to listen to the teacher's introduction

2020
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:05,160
The video that just didn't have time to play

2021
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,700
Thanks

2022
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,700
Is that... blessed?

2023
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,200
that...

2024
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:14,240
how to go back

2025
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:19,040
that...that will...

2026
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,740
The one I put...

2027
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,500
it's here

2028
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
OK here

2029
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,000
Like this time he put a...

2030
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
liquid hazard

2031
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
That thing just now was a liquid hazard

2032
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,500
put that superconductor in

2033
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,500
put liquid harm

2034
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,000
Then he put a magnet on it

2035
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,000
Look at him now...

2036
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,000
he wants to push him

2037
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,000
he can push

2038
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
no middle...

2039
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,500
I wanted to do an experiment for you guys

2040
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:00,500
but...

2041
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I guess the experiment didn't see clearly

2042
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
it shines more clearly

2043
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,300
it pushes it

2044
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,140
it didn't touch

2045
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:08,000
That magnet is floating

2046
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,200
real suspension

2047
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,300
look at its invisible hands

2048
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:13,900
yes catch this

2049
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,500
but it's not tight enough now

2050
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,900
so it pushes it down a little bit

2051
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,300
The magnetic field lines go in and exceed how many

2052
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,400
Then it can be lifted

2053
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,100
You see such a heavy whole block

2054
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:24,500
Magnets can pull it up

2055
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,000
then it is here

2056
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,600
put this in too

2057
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,800
take this

2058
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,100
It's actually right here in the glove

2059
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,900
That temperature is what I just said

2060
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:37,500
liquid hi is -200 degrees

2061
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,300
It's minus 200 degrees

2062
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,200
so around 200 degrees

2063
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,600
It must wear gloves

2064
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,600
Otherwise it will show here

2065
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,700
It puts an orange on top

2066
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:49,800
it doesn't matter

2067
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,100
still heavy enough

2068
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,900
Then here it will show

2069
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
it does something special

2070
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
it's magnetic

2071
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
its vertical line is uneven

2072
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
The inside is different from the outside

2073
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I want to say that once the lines of magnetic force have a curvature

2074
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
it takes this

2075
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Wait a minute and it will put this

2076
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
put it on

2077
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
you see

2078
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
it won't stop

2079
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
such a little effort

2080
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
push it a little

2081
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
it keeps spinning on this

2082
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
can turn for a long time

2083
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
it can spin for a long time

2084
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I'm running out of time to show

2085
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
this is just for show

2086
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
it this

2087
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
as long as the position is right

2088
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
it can go all the way

2089
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
because it has no resistance

2090
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
It has a little Energy cost

2091
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
very low is this

2092
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
When the lines of magnetic force enter and exit

2093
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
a little bit

2094
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
it has very little energy

2095
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
to it as a whole

2096
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
so it lasts a long time

2097
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I just said that the real experiment is not like this

2098
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,700
Seriously, take a superconductor and make a coil

2099
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:09,200
Make one, then connect and add battery

2100
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,600
The superconducting current starts running and the battery is removed

2101
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,800
The current can run here for several years

2102
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,000
It still has energy cost

2103
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,200
Why? There is radiation

2104
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,100
but that's too little

2105
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,200
Not important to the whole energy

2106
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,500
so it can be years

2107
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:29,800
Then they shut down the experiment

2108
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,400
because there's no need to do it

2109
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,300
It means that the resistance is 0

2110
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,700
In fact, what they want to show is

2111
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:35,800
Otherwise, no one would believe

2112
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:37,700
Is the resistance really 0?

2113
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:40,300
Is it 10-------16 times

2114
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,600
10 of -------- 25 times issued

2115
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,600
But we now what I just told you

2116
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,100
Actually the proof is that it is true 0

2117
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:49,200
So it is a quantum number

2118
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,500
0 is not an hour

2119
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:56,200
is a real discreet quantum number

2120
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,600
0,1,2,3, that is 0

2121
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:00,000
when later many

2122
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,980
Physics is about finding the first, second, and third of the frame and pillow, which Nanova said

2123
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,600
It is this system that has a certain value

2124
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:13,600
This 1 is not 1.001 0.999

2125
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:17,980
Even a DG can't be wrong

2126
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,200
this is quantum

2127
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,840
This is the macroscopic quantum

2128
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:24,360
Macroscopic quantum like this

2129
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:25,880
such a big thing

2130
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,100
all behave

2131
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,700
This is the macroscopic quantum

2132
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,120
Of course we want to find this at room temperature

2133
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:35,280
Then there's the real room-temperature quantum attitude

2134
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:40,420
Now since the first superconductor is 4 degrees

2135
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,060
absolute temperature 4 degrees

2136
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,060
How high is it now?

2137
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,500
100

2138
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:50,260
High temperature superconductors can be pressurized up to 165 degrees

2139
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,020
Negative pressure is 135 degrees

2140
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,900
But recently a new superconductor has been learned

2141
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:59,940
Very high pressure is tight with sea seat

2142
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,380
Kangkang, that Haocheng came to Shiwen, but this has not been officially accepted

2143
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:09,740
This one still has Zeng Na, and Zeng Chao

2144
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:15,040
But in any case, there is hope, there is no reason why it cannot be higher

2145
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:22,060
Maybe you don’t need Shiwen, if there is a guide to do it in the icy and snowy winter

2146
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:25,860
Yes, during this suddenly everyone thought, if you look at this and think why

2147
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:29,340
At that time, everyone was a sensation, and they went to the meeting in the middle of the night

2148
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:32,500
Thousands of people, not a few meetings

2149
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,500
More than 2,000 people were crowded inside

2150
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,580
I have no place to go in, I stand at the farthest place to watch

2151
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:44,700
Everyone uploaded the slideshow in five minutes, and posted what I did and what I did

2152
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,300
Then this, but why this?

2153
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:53,180
Because when you look at this, you think about the issue of energy, which is too much related to this

2154
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:56,580
With this can solve a big energy problem

2155
01:31:56,580 --> 01:32:00,020
but luckily we haven't done it yet

2156
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
still working hard

2157
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
ok we have no problem

2158
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I just heard Li Benshi answer so many questions

2159
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
such a wonderful speech

2160
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Let's applaud again, thank you Li Bianshi

2161
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I would like to thank you all for coming here

2162
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Feast of knowledge tonight

2163
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Tell you about our next lecture

2164
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
It will be on the evening of Tuesday, December 13th

2165
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
it's seven o'clock

2166
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
We've come to a completely different topic

2167
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The topic is the encounter between history and criminology

2168
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:51,000
What I want to talk about is the analysis of the theft crime in the middle of the 19th century

2169
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
So the speaker is researcher Wurenshu

2170
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Is a researcher at the Institute of Modern History of Zhongan Academy of Sciences

2171
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
So the same in

2172
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,400
in this venue

2173
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,760
Please if you are interested

2174
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,600
You can register online

2175
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,800
thank you all

2176
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,500
have a nice evening everyone

2177
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:11,400
Thank you Li Yan
