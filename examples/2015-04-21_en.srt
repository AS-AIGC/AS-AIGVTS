Documentary of back-embrナe

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Feast of knowledge this month we're having a feast of chemistry

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am very honored to invite Professor Zhou Bitai from National Taiwan University

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Also our old colleague for many years

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Later you will see that he is a very, very capable person

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is also a workaholic, one person can be used by three people

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
his details

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We also saw beautiful pictures

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Please enjoy it later

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let me first give a brief introduction to our keynote speaker

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I just said that he is the current chair professor of National Taiwan University

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
In fact, when I just ate

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He did very, very broadly

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He probably knows everything about chemistry.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,440
Then if the National Science Council or the Ministry of Science and Technology has any problems, please ask him to solve them.

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,440
He is also very good at writing

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,940
write fast and long

20
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,700
So besides teaching in the Department of Chemistry, he is currently

21
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,880
He is also in charge of National Taiwan University Chemistry

22
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:29,540
National Taiwan University National Taiwan University's technology research center for emerging materials and prospective research

23
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,740
This is actually the Nano Research Center

24
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,040
This is a soft center in National Taiwan University

25
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,240
Virtual Center

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,140
that's some research topics

27
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,040
Then there are some teams in

28
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:55,840
work together on a common interest

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,040
He was Fu Jen Catholic University in 1970

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,260
Received the school room in 1989

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,360
Then in 1985 in

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Ph.D. from Florida State University

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,460
that's there

34
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,200
South Carolina worked as an assistant professor

35
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,100
seven years

36
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,260
87 to 94

37
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,100
Chung Cheng University

38
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,080
recruit back, I remember that time

39
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,240
National Taiwan University is also looking for you

40
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,840
at Chung Cheng University

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,040
do 2001

42
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,040
The Chemistry Department of Chung Cheng University is in his hands

43
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
also reborn

44
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,740
In 2001 we were honored

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,500
The Chemistry Department of National Taiwan University found it

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,240
Until now, I used to be in the chemistry department

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,740
I was also the head of the department anyway.

48
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,860
he did all the hard work

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Actually Zhou Bitai, I remember that I seemed to be

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you were in berkeley

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
at Berkeley

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Just when I won the Nobel Prize

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
At that time, you and Su Zhiming went to visit

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
he hasn't got it yet

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
then 1985

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Then he turned out to be physical chemistry

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
cutting chemistry

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just heard that he also does organic synthesis

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So I say he is versatile

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Of course, there are countless papers published

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And there are quite a lot of important chemical journals

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
this reviewer

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Anyway, all the domestic awards

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
he has it all

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Course Ministry Academic Awards

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
National Trophy

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,640
Distinguished Award of the National Science Council, etc.

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,940
Internationally

69
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,980
he is also

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Royal Society of Chemistry

71
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,360
Rose Society

72
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,380
Fellow

73
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,500
Asia Photochemical

74
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,040
Achievement Award

75
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,840
in Japan

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
recently

77
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,160
at this

78
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,720
Uncle Van Thieme

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,020
This is probably currently

80
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
Top of the line in chemistry

81
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,120
Journal

82
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,160
has published his

83
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,700
Authere profile

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,600
I guess I'll cut the blah blah blah anyway.

85
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,440
There are so many medals, so there is no need to go here

86
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,720
then we'll be fine

87
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,300
Come and enjoy this chemical feast

88
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,840
I welcome to be a professor

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,120
thank you thank you

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's so hard to prepare an academic speech.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's really too difficult because to talk about it is to say

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
understandable and then another point

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
At least chemically, why would it hold him together?

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It took days, basically

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Then I guess I'm just taking this opportunity

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Then I would like to talk about some of the people in my laboratory.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
i find it interesting

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Then everyone can listen

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, what's interesting about chemistry?

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to derive him

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So I probably use this today

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It means that my lab develops some interesting molecules

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
some nanomaterials

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course I have many, many things that I haven't said

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Because sorry, it's just two hours

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't finish talking for five hours

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
basically speaking

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
so i just pick these

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think one thing can make you feel like saying

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have learned something to say about this matter

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
teacher tell you

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Just be a teacher

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
To speak until students understand

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that was difficult

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,840
a lot of luggage, that's a completely different one, ok, let's take a look

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,540
What about my lab, basically

117
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,640
Sorry, I use Chinese like this, ah, it’s safe, because I can’t translate them into that one by one

118
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,360
As for my laboratory, Vice President Wang also talked about it just now

119
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,860
Actually, I was born to actually do this

120
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,820
uh, fast ray, laser these

121
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,020
These dynamics, spectral dynamics, OK, so actually I

122
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,680
When I was in Bokri, what did I do in Bokri

123
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,280
In fact, they are all heavy duty, just doing these things

124
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,960
How to get the laser and why, so I am very familiar with Li Renzhe's laboratory

125
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,160
Because we're doing this, OK

126
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,640
Basically speaking, this piece is still my center

127
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,560
It’s laser spotosphate, OK, that’s all about lasers

128
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
The optical physics block is still my center, but the center has developed

129
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,920
In fact, based on the current spectral dynamics, it is probably the most chemically

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,800
The fastest one is our non-bird laser, just 10-15 times

131
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,360
To the 10-14th power second, ah, some people say, hey, the Ato laser is faster

132
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,480
It is 10-18, which is very difficult to do in chemistry, because

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,040
Ladies and gentlemen, if you have some physical fundamentals, sea cucumbers are not only there

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,760
You can tell, when you were ten minus 18, square seconds

135
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,460
Your energy band is already so wide, for me, the state you can explore in chemistry

136
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,800
There are almost none, except you are atomic

137
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,420
What ES-Opto, 2S-Opto, can do this

138
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,280
In terms of chemistry, we don’t actually discuss these things in Aton.

139
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Our last time Aton, Aton

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,640
Just atom, atom, try to translate into Chinese for me

141
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,480
These so-called molecules made of atoms and atoms, OK, we use the molecular state

142
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,200
So this is still my center

143
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,320
Then after I was in the center, in fact, since I came to South Carolina

144
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,580
Then I went back to Zhongzheng and went to National Taiwan University

145
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,560
In fact, I have been spending and expanding my field along the way

146
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,040
In fact, the most likely is after the National Taiwan University, that is, the ten years

147
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,600
Probably spread from this place, OK

148
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,600
For example, I do a lot of very basic science

149
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,720
OK, just now, that is to say

150
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
For example, do some straight-to-direct transfer, direct-to-electricity transfer, energy transfer

151
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,780
i do this a lot

152
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,580
But from this direct transfer, I will tell some development

153
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,760
Why is it transferred directly, because there is a relationship between inner clarity and clarity

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So I started to design the ring

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What can be kissed and what can be done

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do get stuck together with other molecules

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Then do some identification functions

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
so I do a lot of this

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's because to do this

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You have to work with him on this one

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But cooperation is sorry

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Just now the dean Fang Fuyuan said

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I am a person who spends more than fifteen hours a day

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So no one is following me

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
i really didn't lie to you

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Absolutely no one is following in my footsteps

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
so come by yourself later

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
OK, so I'm going to start compositing myself.

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
start with materialization

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
start learning how to synthesize

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
why do what

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
on the way

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
do some bio recognition

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How to get to the detection of bio

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
wait a minute we'll talk about some

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
OK

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
even just said

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We're going to start developing these

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
how to carry these

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
how to take these molecules

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What the hell body

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So we do a lot of nano science

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
basically

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Therefore, in terms of Nami materials

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will do quite a lot

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
From 2003 to 2004

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
When science in Taiwan and Macao rises

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
make a lot of glowing materials

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The material of this perm energy

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,800
OK basically

191
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,200
so you know along the way

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
Dean Wangfu said just now

193
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,700
I probably cover everything in chemistry

194
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,400
Basically OK to some extent

195
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
You said that there is deepening here

196
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes wait a minute I'll talk about deepening OK basically

197
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,100
you'll know it when you hear it

198
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,700
so but anyway

199
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,900
what i'm talking about

200
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,900
very simple is

201
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,200
It's chemistry and light

202
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,500
Because light is OK after all

203
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,800
That's what you said, that's the light

204
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
OK, that light is basically for me

205
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
is my specialty

206
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
OK so I've been doing

207
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,700
The so-called mechanism of light and chemistry

208
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,100
OK basically OK

209
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,300
how from chemistry

210
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,700
wait a minute i will bring a lot

211
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
show mode come over ok basically

212
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,900
so that's how to get to the stalls what to do

213
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,200
This is probably my basic one

214
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
Center thinking OK in this place

215
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
Of course one thing is

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,900
so of course one thing

217
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,600
What I'm going to talk about today is probably molecules

218
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,900
Deepen the molecular ratio of the machine material, which is basically

219
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,200
Probably I will cover this inside

220
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
What about these areas?

221
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll probably talk about three of them.

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,100
One is OK to talk about these so-called clear-eyed elements

223
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,600
I'll start with the basics OK

224
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,900
clear viewer

225
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,100
Because after all, it's more common sense

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
Some elements of internal and external clarity

227
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,800
what physical properties it has

228
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
What are its photophysical properties?

229
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,800
What properties does it have when illuminated

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I will talk about this

231
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,000
Then one very important thing is to say

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,800
water is clear

233
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,600
So how to see inside from the clear water

234
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,400
go call it

235
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,000
untie what we want

236
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Then I can go and probe the water

237
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
This water certainly does not mean our water

238
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
That is to say, the water in biochemical

239
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,600
This is a very important and most urgent development for me

240
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Also I want to be at Nano Airport

241
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,200
some listeners like to listen

242
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,600
Basically, let me talk about some nano-airports in semiconductors

243
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Especially now the hardest thing is

244
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
The entire industry in Taiwan will be defeated

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
These are the so-called frame pains

246
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
quantum dot display

247
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,200
Let me tell you that everyone in Taiwan is panicking now

248
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Said that the industry said that this would not leave

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Taiwan is probably all cut off

250
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
wait a minute listen

251
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
there's something i'll talk about

252
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
And Nano Airport

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Composite material, OK, basically

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So, what I'm talking about today is probably

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Among the seven or eight fields, these are four fields

256
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's like Solar Energy Cell, or

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I probably don’t know much about O-ray, so I won’t talk about it

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Because I know I've seen the one before you, like

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Chen Jindi, what, many people have said this

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What kind of luminescent material is used for what, so this place

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I probably won't talk about it, I'll just focus on

262
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
These few, these four are probably

263
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Molecules of this aspect of Qingjian

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
OK, and then I will talk about some unavoidable materials

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Probably in this place, okay, OK

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So first I will talk about some so-called

267
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Seeing Molecules Inside Clearly, This Is Interesting in Photophysics

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's really interesting, OK, you'll know when you listen to it

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
OK, let's talk about the catalysis of water molecules

270
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
OK, from water molecule catalysis, how do I go

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
To measure these water molecules in biochemistry

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let me tell you one more thing, I haven’t said it here yet, but I’ll do it too

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why do you talk about the Dynamic of Protin?

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Just use it as a protin and have something

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Any transfer in or what to do, look at its Dynamic

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Or do what QuickStore does, I do it in reverse

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I am using

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Use the water in Protin to detect the activity of Protin

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
OK, so this is a different approach

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is probably the first in the world, no one has done this before

281
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
OK, basically, so we'll know when we hear it

282
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
OK, so let me start with these few

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
These are the things that you can see

284
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
what is its molecule like

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, I actually did this two months ago

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The one who thinks before this so-called commemoration

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
When I made the list, I talked about some

288
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
OK, but today because it's an hour and a half or more

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
OK, so I'll just put a more comprehensive

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
OK, it's more detailed, I'll put it in the second place

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
OK, sorry, I can speak English, I can’t help it, it’s still a matter

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
OK, let's take a look, then you have to talk about Qingjian

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
OK, let's talk about Nei Qingjian, talk about these molecules

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you start pointing now

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I won’t go into more about fingering, as fingering has a physical definition

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Let me tell you that three crackers make one finger, OK

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We won't talk about this much, this high-energy physics

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It seems that several high-energy physics have talked about it here, OK

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We don't talk about this thing, we can talk about chemistry or biochemistry

300
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then this is normal, it’s H positive, isn’t it?

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,220
If H is positive, the most famous one is to tell you about the acid-base of Arrhinius

302
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,200
Just tell you that you can release a proton, this is sour

303
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,400
that's basically it, right?

304
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,200
If you want to talk about it, that's fine. If you talk about address biochemistry, what about sour fish?

305
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,100
That is, proton has sour fish, the formation of mesohalite

306
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Right, let me tell you in terms of biochemistry, we call it Zhizhi BOM

307
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,900
OK, this, I only found out this time during the preparation, this is called BOM, OK, basically

308
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Just proton BOMP, POMP

309
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,500
The promb pump, of course the most famous, is very simple?

310
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,200
That is, if you want to get from the cells inside

311
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
To pump it out, basically you have energy for it

312
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Just turn it into ATP, OK, release a proton

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Basically you just let the energy out, pump it out from here

314
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,160
If you need energy, it's simple, you make a very simple

315
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,800
CAMME Osmosis, is what we call chemical osmosis

316
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,100
If you just let it go back, you can gain energy

317
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,900
OK, so proton is in the whole biochemistry or physics or chemistry

318
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,400
In fact, its significance is very, very, very important

319
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,300
Then there is proton, one thing we want to talk about next is to talk about Hydrogen BOM

320
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,000
The Hydrogen BOM, basically

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,200
It's the Qing sword, right?

322
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,080
Then Qing Jian will tell you one thing, that is

323
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,640
If we speak in chemistry

324
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,280
The most famous one is Sharing the Sword

325
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Yes, how long is it built for sharing the sword?

326
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,120
If with a single sword

327
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,280
That's about 1 to 1.5 n cool

328
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
is i

329
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,960
It is 10's -8cm

330
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
10'-10m

331
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,360
right, it's almost that long

332
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,120
How do we define Qingjian?

333
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,080
Generally speaking

334
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,960
Here is written OK

335
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,400
In fact, the earliest definition of the Qing sword was in 1912

336
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,600
Oh it's so early OK basically speaking

337
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,320
OK that's usually a mess

338
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,960
By 2011 IUPEC

339
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,600
It's the International Naming Association telling you

340
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,480
how to define don't care

341
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,080
How did we make the Qing sword before?

342
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,160
it's very simple

343
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,200
This so-called highly electronegative

344
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Right? Follow up what happened

345
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
OK, basically it’s called Youqing Sword, right?

346
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,200
That is to say, eggs, sheep

347
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,520
These things serve again

348
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,120
But what about the current basic definition

349
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,280
just tell you one thing is

350
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,600
any chemical bond

351
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,480
OK as long as there is a follow-up

352
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,120
in this kind of

353
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,040
No matter the geometry, you squeeze it to that place

354
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,300
It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it is 1.5 to 2.2 N pairs

355
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,500
Basically we just generalize it

356
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Something similar to CH can also be seen clearly with other itineraries

357
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,000
OK, basically let me give you an example, this one was published in the last three months

358
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,800
OK, both zero and green can produce clear vision

359
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Because there are 2.1 N pairs in the middle

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
OK 2.1 I so say in terms of the modern version of Kiyomi

361
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,000
This is called Qingjian, so Qingjian is already what it is

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
very very popular

363
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,500
OK basically put it this way okay let's see

364
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
So in terms of this structure

365
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's take a look at one thing, in terms of chemistry

366
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,500
What's going on with Qing Jian?

367
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
About 30 to 100 kcal of energy

368
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
is that it will stabilize you at 30 to 100 kcal

369
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,500
We all know that van der Valli is very weak at about 0.1 kcal, OK

370
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
The energy of the long temperature is also about 0.1 0.5 kcal

371
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Even the long-term temperature of 298K is very weak.

372
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
The Hydrogen stick is somewhere in between, about 1.2 to 10 kcal

373
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,000
OK this different one Kiyomi

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I am listing these relatively strong clear views in the past.

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,900
I just kept it, eggs, why can I see it clearly?

376
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
we'll see later

377
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,400
Probably about 1.2 to 10 kcal

378
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
Fu is an exception

379
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,900
Because we think that there is ionized clear view

380
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,400
Generally speaking, it is about 1.2 to 10 kcal.

381
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
then why do you want to see clearly

382
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
Just to tell you it can also be seen by pedestrians

383
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,600
can also be what? in a way just take it off

384
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,900
able to reformation

385
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,000
reformation

386
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,400
what is this ? biochemically it needs

387
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
it needs to be this way

388
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,100
You can't use your words so tightly

389
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,200
So how does it do these metabolisms

390
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,600
It's the metabolism. It's impossible.

391
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,700
so this is why

392
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,500
Wait a minute we talk about the base pale of DNA

393
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,300
that's what it does, in a way

394
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,800
OK

395
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
ok, see you in chemistry

396
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
When it comes to chemistry, I have to talk about this person, right?

397
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,800
Chemical see these words chemical bound

398
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,000
What is this bund for?

399
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,100
In fact, it is when it is in class

400
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,200
It has not been published

401
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,900
I wrote it on the blackboard during class.

402
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,500
This Berkely professor is called G.N. Lewis

403
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,200
You know, Lewis acid test

404
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,300
you should know right

405
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,100
But your G.N. Lewis actually it

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He is not the most famous doctor Lu acid test

407
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
he is the father of thermodynamics

408
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
is the ancestor of chemical thermodynamics

409
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
basically talk

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
OK but everyone remembers that he is

411
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Doctor Lu acid test

412
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Basically OK

413
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's when he was experimenting in Burkley

414
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Speaking of this place

415
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I have one under here

416
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
compare that

417
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
In fact, what are we talking about?

418
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
OK let's see one thing

419
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Right, you can find it from Google

420
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Google he recently helped

421
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Do not believe you can now key

422
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
About 5.7 million B

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
OK but this kind of thing

424
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think 5 million is enough, right?

425
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's far worse than the entertainment industry

426
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
OK entertainment

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Come on, let's see what the next entertainment industry is called

428
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What is another stick called?

429
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Called James Bond

430
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You see James Bond has 85.8 million

431
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So the answer is still much worse.

432
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Basically you're like the entertainment industry

433
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You see, this kind of stick is equally good, but it’s so much worse.

434
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
OK so there's nothing to say

435
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
let's take a look

436
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okay, what about the scissors?

437
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
We are role models

438
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I just changed this English today

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Change to Chinese OK

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The answer is that we see

441
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,220
ATGC is Adding and Siaming or light and shadow and Sitle Sync

442
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,820
look at this clear

443
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,100
basically the place

444
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,560
Published in 2003

445
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,000
This JPC publishes

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,440
Let me tell you that AT has about -11000 cards

447
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,520
These two cut together have -11000 calories

448
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,120
Then let me tell you Kobrenbaum is 50 to 100

449
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,040
so it's all very

450
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,600
about five times ten times weaker than it is

451
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,400
But basically three are stronger

452
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,040
Just one more, about 20 kilocalories

453
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,200
but more than anything

454
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,080
than these so-called carpools

455
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,440
broken tightly

456
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,280
that's much weaker

457
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,520
so it can be anything

458
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,120
Breakdown Reformation

459
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,680
Causes of Breakdown Reformation

460
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,920
OK just need to see clearly

461
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,640
OK, then you say one is not strong enough

462
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,240
That's all right

463
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,720
The whole cassette is strong enough.

464
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,520
If you say something like this you don't believe

465
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,680
I want you to always trust Gweaver Organic

466
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,000
right

467
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,240
just one line won't work

468
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,960
Then tie thousands of threads and you won't be able to move

469
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
OK so maybe one thing

470
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
it's obvious to tell you

471
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,720
The biggest advantage of Kiyomi is in this place

472
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,480
OK will obviously give you this kind of sense

473
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,200
good

474
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,680
That's clear

475
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,160
You said from 1912 to now

476
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,080
a hundred years

477
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,560
Exactly 102 years, 103 years

478
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,640
But one big thing is still a Hot topic

479
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
still a very popular

480
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
For example, the recent ones, look at last year's ones

481
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,240
let's see this, shall we

482
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,800
this is a molecule

483
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,040
called A-hydroxyquinoline

484
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,840
leave it alone

485
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,160
Look at this when it's cold

486
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,680
Atomic Force Microscopy FM

487
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,200
Atomic force microscope you also see

488
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
Seems like Kiyomi is here

489
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
look at this place

490
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,600
These are here

491
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
seems clear

492
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
look like this

493
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,440
It was published in Science

494
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
This is the mainland

495
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,560
It should be Chinese Academy of Sciences

496
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
basically

497
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,520
that developed

498
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,040
but after a year or two

499
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,400
was overthrown after a year

500
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
this may be problematic

501
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
Everyone, if you say it has physics, you will know it.

502
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,320
because they found out

503
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
you use an atomic force microscope

504
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
For example, look at this Compound

505
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
this molecule

506
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,200
You see, this molecule is egg-and-egg

507
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,880
Vice President Wang, look at this

508
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,760
must know better than me

509
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,720
because he said he was ejaculating

510
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,880
You see, the eggs are not clear at all

511
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,600
egg on egg

512
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,880
egg to egg

513
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,000
He still sees this

514
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,460
So answering one thing is that it is difficult

515
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,160
ok, he thinks there is a problem with this clear view

516
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,760
It means don't underestimate

517
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,660
Of course you often see why rigorously choose Weijing

518
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
What would you say when you saw glasses on WeChat?

519
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,160
What may be the artifact

520
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,260
It may be the artifact that it appeared in the experiment

521
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,260
this is something that is often seen

522
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,460
So I'm telling you to be careful, be careful

523
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,260
Recently because of this post

524
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,760
All I know look at AFFM or STM

525
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,960
are being scrutinized very carefully

526
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,460
Especially if it can be published on the Lianyiqiu series

527
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,620
will probably be scrutinized

528
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,460
But from here it can be said

529
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
It's important to call it Hide and Keep on

530
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,960
basically

531
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,460
Generally speaking, what do we think about the topic?

532
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,960
That's easy, just watch an ordinary MMA

533
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,460
why? let me give you an example

534
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
You also know that the clearer the stronger

535
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Basically there are fewer electrons on this side

536
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,960
as we call it inside the direct nuclear tool

537
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
it becomes more shift

538
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
The more when the field shift

539
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,460
in this longer place

540
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,960
outdated place

541
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,500
This molecule is synthesized by us

542
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,000
You know there's an inward arrow over here

543
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,500
There's an inward arrow

544
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
OK, didn't you just say that?

545
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
N and OH are stronger

546
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
N, OH and OH are relatively weak

547
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,000
So let's just say, this place is what

548
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,500
This is its protein

549
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
is its direct point, this is its direct point

550
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,000
So we look at it this way

551
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
it really has introverted arrows

552
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Because it exceeds, as long as it exceeds MMA, exceeds 10

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Probably what the slope of this place should be

554
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
produced by inward arrows

555
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We look at it in this very simple way

556
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, here is a very special one

557
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What about water, water is the most special thing, why

558
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
One water has several falling arrows, four falling arrows

559
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
A word of water, you see

560
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,500
It can all form arrows, OK, basically

561
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,000
So it's the single molecule that provides the highest arrow density in nature

562
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
one thing for sure

563
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And look at this place, it's starting to form ice

564
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
it's starting to form ice, ok, basically

565
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a calculation, it's starting to form ice

566
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If you look at this place

567
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Generally speaking, we talk about

568
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There should be someone who is making energy water, OK, basically speaking

569
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
this

570
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
Basically, all energy water is

571
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,360
It forms different, this is still hexagonal packing

572
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,900
but what makes a difference

573
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,100
Different from what we call the People's Gang

574
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
It forms the principle of different Chinese gangs, ok

575
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,600
Then some people said, ah, why are these different energies?

576
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,060
Actually it's all one

577
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,100
A hexagonal closest packing is actually the same

578
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
It's different only in what

579
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,600
It is polycrystalline

580
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,900
How fine is this polycrystalline?

581
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,700
can give you a different way

582
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Then tell me, does this have any different energy?

583
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,600
I don't dare to tell you that I do scientific research

584
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,300
But we've been doing this different shape recently

585
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,600
ok, cause this is under different pressure

586
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,800
you can form different words

587
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,400
We found that we hacked our molecules into here

588
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,500
Its radiance is not quite the same

589
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,400
ok, but this has nothing to do with energy water

590
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,700
I just want to tell you one thing, that this is actually

591
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,900
It is a so-called polycrystalline

592
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,300
it's so detailed

593
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,000
Ok, how fine this is depends on different environments

594
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,900
it can make a difference, it's true

595
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,200
I admit it

596
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Does it have any energy? I dare not admit it

597
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
ok, but because from a scientific point of view, but it does

598
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
actually there is a difference

599
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,180
Okay, so let's talk about Chizi and Qingjian

600
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,440
ok now talk about pool transfer

601
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,100
because wait a minute my main

602
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,840
main central idea

603
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,680
ok transfer in pool

604
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,440
what pool transfer

605
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,280
The easiest thing to think about is acid-base neutralization.

606
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,080
Acid-base neutralization you see

607
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,940
it's a sour

608
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,080
It's an alkali, right?

609
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,280
Ah, what is acid-base neutralization?

610
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,780
Just throw this acid to

611
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,480
Eh, common, if it is the acid of Arrhenius

612
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
throw it to him

613
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,780
This is what was originally thrown to him at this place

614
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,780
ok, this is acid-base neutralization

615
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,880
Isn't acid-base neutralization just to transfer the pool?

616
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,280
This is the same reason, ok, normal

617
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,780
Well this is in all of our modalities

618
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,720
It's what you call everything you see

619
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,820
No light, no time in this excited state

620
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,020
ok you see this

621
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,320
But when in the excited state

622
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,820
that's more serious we like

623
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
We say that when the pool shifts to an electronically excited state

624
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,260
more likely to happen

625
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,120
ok this is in this basic state

626
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,260
ok is in the most stable state

627
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,120
This is lighting several examples

628
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,620
Let's do our part

629
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
Oh, but it's your duty to know

630
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,220
But duty is often used

631
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,680
If you activate H-mea, it will be light, light paper

632
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,920
illuminate with light

633
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,320
light it up

634
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,440
What about after the excitation?

635
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,400
very simple thing

636
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,640
I'll tell you about chemistry

637
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,720
You excite it is to put this electron

638
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,960
ok we call Pai Electronics

639
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,840
T to excited state

640
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,400
that's what we call counterintelligence

641
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,920
Shoot Star, Call Anti-Spies

642
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,480
Then you also know that we are from the middle school

643
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,400
start learning

644
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,600
ok here if you have kids

645
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,680
Sorry, there is no way in middle school

646
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,520
you can talk

647
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,960
why would you

648
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,040
there will be this turtle ring

649
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,520
That is to conform to the beat electron of 4n plus 2

650
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,240
I don't mean to say

651
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,680
Just 6 beat electrons in this place

652
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,080
Is 4n equal to 1?

653
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,400
ok you drop an electron T

654
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,080
It becomes unstable when it becomes five beat electrons

655
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,920
What to do if it is unstable

656
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,000
He needs to hurry up and get an electron into it.

657
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,800
where did he get it

658
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,640
If there is an OH here

659
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,800
Doesn't it have OH itself?

660
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,880
There's a so-called lone electron

661
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,400
Lonely electricity Lone with electrons, quickly fill in the electrons

662
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,480
Once filled in

663
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
this stable

664
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,160
But after stabilization

665
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,080
After filling this in

666
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,240
After becoming less electron

667
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,120
This Proton is very sour

668
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,160
super sour

669
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
How sour? Let's see

670
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,720
basically in

671
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,320
look

672
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,440
In fact, the duty lies in

673
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
At the time of this GroundState

674
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,480
ok we generally see

675
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,000
9.8 is a bit less

676
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,100
But in the excited state it is -0.1

677
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,100
acidic than sulfuric acid

678
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,900
it is more acidic than sulfuric acid

679
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,100
So this H will run away

680
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,900
Run away and become O-Fu-H-Zen

681
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,500
We call this acid Photosac

682
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,000
When exposed to light, it produces acid that is more acidic than sulfuric acid

683
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,200
Because this magnetic paper will be thrown away

684
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Throwing this into the water means throwing it into the water for hydration.

685
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
If we create an environment

686
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,800
This environment is after the Proton magnetic paper is thrown away.

687
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,200
There is a pair of scissors

688
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,800
in this molecule it can accept it

689
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,900
that would be fun

690
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,400
Let me give you an example let's look at this

691
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,700
OK, so I'll design a random molecule

692
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,400
This molecule is very acidic after being exposed to light.

693
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,200
But I have a scissors here

694
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,600
This Pyridine is cut

695
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
N is a scissor

696
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,800
So it would have produced a molecular internal clearance in this place

697
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,900
So after you light it, it is very sour, where will it go?

698
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,300
It's here to cut

699
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,100
So after the light was illuminated, the magnetic paper was originally in this place.

700
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,800
it switches to this place

701
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,900
When you switch to this place, you will know one thing is

702
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
tell you according to organic chemistry

703
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,500
This whole shoot together will be reassembled once again

704
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,700
So it's actually isomers

705
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,000
But this shot is completely different from this shot

706
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,200
So an excitation would have been 330 which is in UV

707
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,000
What happens when it's triggered

708
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,500
If it becomes different, it emits green light

709
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,000
will turn into green light

710
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
it's an interesting thing

711
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Then this...

712
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You said teacher, what are you doing?

713
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You design this thing and we're actually doing spectral dynamics

714
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Just ask this after the light...

715
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
how fast is this finger

716
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
OK how fast and what steps to enter

717
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
it will move from here to this place

718
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
how fast

719
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,500
does it have energy

720
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,000
Why, why, actually we are researching

721
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
but today i won't talk

722
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Because of this talk everyone is asleep OK basically

723
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
But to tell you one thing is I use an animation to tell you

724
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,500
OK, for example, this lighting

725
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,000
How fast is it? About the same

726
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,500
almost 55

727
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
It's 5.5% to 10's sub-11 and it will pass in ten seconds

728
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
how did it pass because it was like this

729
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,000
You see it bends like this

730
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,500
Then after getting the same Distance

731
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,000
he came from here

732
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,500
OK, you can see it and say

733
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,000
We are researching this

734
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
how fast is he

735
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,500
or is he disabled

736
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,000
why why

737
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
just this way

738
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,500
I won't talk today, just talk to you

739
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,000
he has this condition

740
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,500
well, that excites the transfer in the instruction

741
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
in fact, to be honest

742
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,000
what are you doing now

743
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
still researching

744
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And it's a big one

745
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
That is to say, last year I organized a

746
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500
A meeting in the United States

747
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,000
Please help me with ACS

748
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
basically speaking

749
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,500
Of course this is our design

750
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
I got this from JPCB

751
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
cover award, OK, basically

752
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
we design a

753
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,500
You see, after lighting with lightning

754
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
After lighting, this pro-tom

755
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,000
come here

756
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's because it's two common

757
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
One is me and one is at Georgia Tech

758
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,500
OK, so from

759
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Running from Taiwan to Georgia Tech

760
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
we would have written

761
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,000
Running from Taiwan to Georgia Tech

762
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Why are you writing it here?

763
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Then what is the NPU Logo doing?

764
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,500
later rejected

765
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
It was rejected by the mainland, OK, basically speaking

766
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
so this won't work

767
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,000
But it's like this now, ok

768
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,160
basically tell you he is still this

769
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,060
This was posted last month

770
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,920
basically speaking

771
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,520
So he is still a big group

772
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,800
Especially in Europe doing this

773
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,000
Fundamental Science的

774
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
so much really

775
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,900
And the functions of Europeans are different

776
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,560
When we have a meeting, we go outside the door to chat

777
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,000
Why, what, the flash is gone

778
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,120
the european sits over there

779
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,460
He won't leave from the first day to the seventh day

780
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,480
This is our different one

781
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,600
one by one one by one attitude

782
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,000
Nature also uses machine gun bags to indicate transfer

783
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,800
come and see

784
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,320
I give the simplest example

785
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,040
same reason

786
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,760
this is called

787
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
it's flowering

788
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,560
There are many petals in the flower

789
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,760
You only need to see a little yellowish

790
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,000
slightly yellowish

791
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Basically something like this

792
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
then why this thing

793
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,800
come and see

794
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
This thing is less than 400 in Xiguang

795
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,240
is UV

796
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,520
About 350 places

797
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,200
can you watch

798
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,400
In fact, at 350

799
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,000
OK 400 has not absorbed for so long

800
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,600
So everyone absorbs UV

801
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,000
So as long as the sunlight is UV

802
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,840
it absorbs

803
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,840
After absorbing it, use a very fast speed, how fast?

804
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,440
OK, let's measure it first, about 60 DENTAL

805
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,040
It's as fast as -15 seconds at the 60th floor

806
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
Don't talk too fast, it will be right soon, OK

807
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,440
come soon

808
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,600
Come to this place, the same score is easy to pass, optimistic

809
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,040
When the light shines, it's very sour here, very sour Proton

810
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,340
Just come over to this Cabernell

811
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,940
Then come to this place

812
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,540
So in this Ground state

813
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,140
it doesn't exist

814
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,640
But it inspires attitude and it stabilizes

815
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,240
So when it shines it is very

816
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,240
That energy level is very small

817
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,840
Probably in the green range OK

818
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,240
So you take UV

819
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,240
Put it here quickly and then it turns green, what does it mean

820
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,640
Isn't that the same as putting on sunscreen?

821
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,440
For you to wear sunscreen means

822
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,240
Even the flowers are covered with sunscreen

823
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,540
OK after UV up

824
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,740
If you don’t put UV on, put some green light on it right away

825
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,140
Why put green, it's fine if you don't emit light

826
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,640
Our sunscreen, I shine, no

827
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,640
why shine

828
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,840
Reabsorbed by Ye Lishu

829
00:30:59,340 --> 00:30:59,940
do it again

830
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Just look how smart that natural evolution is

831
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,600
Right so natural evolution you have to believe how smart he really is

832
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
so you look at this place in western state

833
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,000
He shines for such a long time, what should the light normally be?

834
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,300
next to this one in his west light

835
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
But he shines in such a long range

836
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,100
Western State UV beams on green

837
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,600
Okay, I'll take this Kang and let it go today.

838
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,000
Let's see one thing is

839
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,200
fun thing

840
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,000
this

841
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,500
Forget it, don't turn it off, let's take a look

842
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,800
OK let's take a look at this

843
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,300
Wait a minute, this can is what you see

844
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,600
this is transparent all transparent

845
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,200
As far as he is in UV, he has nothing at all

846
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,400
he just isn't visible

847
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,800
If visible he has color

848
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,000
it's all transparent

849
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,800
If it is transparent first, let me see

850
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,200
I didn't fake it, it must be like this

851
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
OK basically speaking

852
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,800
I use UV light

853
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,600
But UV light?

854
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,100
Yes it is UV light

855
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,300
I use UV light you see

856
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,100
it's fully transparent

857
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,700
OK so of course he is

858
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
green

859
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,000
And it's green, it's green, it's green

860
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,100
OK basically

861
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,600
he does it this way ok

862
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,500
to take what

863
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
Metabolize these OK basically

864
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,300
So it's an interesting thought

865
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,400
I told you some

866
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,900
That is to say, it actually has this function

867
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:06,700
Of course, we have many such applications in scientific research.

868
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,700
I give the simplest application

869
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,200
In fact, this app is where you inspire this place

870
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,300
it's coming to this place soon

871
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,100
Then it's slow after coming down

872
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,400
Down is 10 - 9 is square seconds

873
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,800
-15 of this 10 is square seconds

874
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,500
-9 out of 10 this is fast again

875
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,100
This is also 10-14-15

876
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
The representative said jump up

877
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,800
Einstein told you about jumping up

878
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,300
Immediately spawn a bunch of

879
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,300
A bunch with this place is no

880
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,000
produces the so-called population inversion

881
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,500
called G volume reversal

882
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
After the G quantity is reversed, the laser will come down immediately.

883
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,900
This is why we can see lasers

884
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
Of course I can't show it

885
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,300
you know my lab is down

886
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,100
That laser comes out beautifully.

887
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,700
So it's all lasers

888
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,400
Basically it's a great laser

889
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,500
let's take a look

890
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,600
Is there any red one?

891
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
you said only green

892
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,200
Do you have others?

893
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,900
Yes, you can give me an example

894
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,600
look at this kang fat

895
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,200
OK, this Kang Fat is the same

896
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,900
Can you see it?

897
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
if you can't see look here

898
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,200
Because it's blocked below OK

899
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,600
So what can OH and N OK form

900
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Form a Hydrogen Bump OK

901
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,000
So it's the same when it's illuminated

902
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,800
this gets sour

903
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,400
Wherever you go, you have to go to this place

904
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
How fast? About 60 Fendals

905
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,800
What is the plural of 60 to 10?

906
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,000
Bump it in this place

907
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,200
Then down comes the red light

908
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,400
If you don't believe me, I'm going to show you this

909
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
I am more beautiful, OK, let me take a look

910
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Yes, I'll take a look

911
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,200
should be in

912
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,400
we are bullish

913
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,600
This also needs to be transparent.

914
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
OK you look transparent

915
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,800
Then I will make UVU, this 360 will definitely work

916
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
red bright red

917
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
OK so you look beautiful OK

918
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,600
Basically it's fine

919
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
Just use this way OK

920
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,600
I put it here when I finish everything

921
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,200
Indicates that I am not cheating OK

922
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,200
ok let's see

923
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,400
So one thing for everyone is

924
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
you know what to say

925
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,000
it really is

926
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,400
ok say this

927
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,200
What is this for

928
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,600
wait a minute i'll tell you

929
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,200
There is a super useful place OK

930
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,000
Everyone, if you listen to

931
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
You can also go back and try

932
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Green fluorescent protein also belongs to the type of direct transfer of G-Pythonite

933
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
why? ok let's see

934
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
For example, this is a green fluorescent protein

935
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
a major luminophore

936
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What is this luminescent group actually related to?

937
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
With H2O, with water, with Amino Acid

938
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It is Amino Acid Residue

939
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
what does it produce

940
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The so-called complex, a clean complex

941
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
So when you shine

942
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In fact, the H will drop

943
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's so sour, just drop it

944
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Then go to this place to generate a massong relay called Massong Relay

945
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
This Proton is coming this way

946
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So use something like this

947
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Actually it is a light

948
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
After this Proton is dropped

949
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Synthesize it to produce a green glow

950
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So what you see is a green glow

951
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It's actually a Nion's glow

952
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
basically you see a glow

953
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But then you pick it up

954
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
you can cut it off

955
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Because it's three Amino Acids that form this

956
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
after you take it off

957
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's like this when you pick it up

958
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Take it up and shine it

959
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
nothing shines nothing nothing

960
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
but the reason is simple

961
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,760
Because inside the protein, it's stuck

962
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,940
stuck in that place, it can't turn

963
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
nothing can be done

964
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,440
But after a bunch of them pick it up

965
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,980
Like a light, this place is called Vinyl's Glue

966
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
it keeps turning

967
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,480
OK, so go up

968
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,140
It was supposed to light up, but it kept spinning

969
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,440
come down in this form

970
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,140
So it doesn't shine, it doesn't shine at all

971
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,940
You see, this quantum yield is a negative thing for a small moment

972
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,440
It means that there is nothing to say, and there is no light at all.

973
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,360
OK, what about my lab?

974
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,940
It's very simple, you see how we do it

975
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,780
We have a very simple thinking

976
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,080
OH in this place

977
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,180
I'll turn it around, turn it over to this place

978
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,580
Drawing is very simple, OK

979
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,880
It is very difficult to learn to draw

980
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,780
Just move this OH over here

981
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,380
Let's see what it looks like when we move over here

982
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,980
Wouldn't it be great if it became like this?

983
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,980
You see, if you change to OH and change to this place

984
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,580
Originally in this place it will turn

985
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
But when there is a clear view here, it will not turn

986
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,880
It turns very little, it's not no turning, but very little turning

987
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
OK, so of course it's possible

988
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,180
And when I shine, I don't need any water why

989
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,980
what it sees in itself

990
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,520
It will come and produce light

991
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,720
Is it possible like this?

992
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,560
This is what we have done since 2007 and 2008

993
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,400
there is a series

994
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,600
Probably all of them were developed in our laboratory.

995
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,200
you see it is very simple

996
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,800
This is natural

997
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,300
OK man-made we just put this OH

998
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,600
move over here

999
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,060
OK once the light is on

1000
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,360
become what

1001
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,900
it can shine like that

1002
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,160
For example, we can use different substitution machines

1003
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,400
in this place, in this place

1004
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,120
we can go all the way

1005
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,360
From yellow, orange, red

1006
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,900
Even to this unseen Neon Infrared

1007
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,200
OK can do this

1008
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,960
We are more powerful recently

1009
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,260
We don't think saying a Hide-Age Gold Rod is strong enough

1010
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,700
so what do we do

1011
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Let's just take this Hide-Age Gold Rod

1012
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,960
LOG it for later

1013
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,660
Then use the above synthetic method

1014
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,600
LOG it again

1015
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,400
If you see this place, put it in the LOG

1016
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,100
So after LOG live

1017
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,200
The two LOGs are called Double LOGs.

1018
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,100
camera hair

1019
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,560
You see, LASING will be produced immediately

1020
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,200
ok why

1021
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Because it emits strong light

1022
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,060
So produce LASING immediately

1023
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,300
so very very beautiful

1024
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,600
what i basically say

1025
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,800
OK so you see

1026
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
When we shine light, a laser is emitted

1027
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,000
But these two places you can tell it's lasers

1028
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,760
OK basically a beautiful experiment

1029
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,740
OK of course you said

1030
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,440
Yes, you synthesized this

1031
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
and see if this is good

1032
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,340
Of course not

1033
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,980
I use one please don't sleep

1034
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,780
I'll talk with one

1035
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,980
what the hell are we doing

1036
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,280
actually what are we doing

1037
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,020
we use

1038
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,780
Good, for example, our laboratory

1039
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,980
OK with a 25 minute laser

1040
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,180
OK 25 minutes is hard to do

1041
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,980
If you are doing physics, you will know

1042
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
OK, what we can do in chemistry is not easy

1043
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,460
You see, after being stimulated

1044
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,660
OK we are

1045
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,500
because it's fast

1046
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,200
In fact, it is synchronized here

1047
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,600
resonate with each other

1048
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
what do we call this

1049
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,100
called

1050
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
called Ostration

1051
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,600
That's it

1052
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,200
we call

1053
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,300
Someone called Quantum Bit

1054
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,200
OK is the BitBitThing of Quantum

1055
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,500
OK then from here

1056
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,300
This is because this is over time

1057
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,920
You can exchange time for

1058
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,680
frequency

1059
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,480
OK so use

1060
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,440
After converting with Fullure

1061
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,540
you convert to a 120 WebNumber

1062
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,680
This is its OverTone

1063
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,540
Just 120 WebNumber

1064
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,340
what does it mean

1065
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,180
In fact, this thing

1066
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
How did the Program come here?

1067
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,480
actually rely on what

1068
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,200
rely on this

1069
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,480
One turn and pass

1070
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,480
OK so a bend

1071
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,080
it vibrate

1072
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
it goes by, so a vibration

1073
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Just one vibration and it's gone

1074
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Then you said that the same translation has changed here

1075
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
how do you know its structure

1076
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
What are its molecules?

1077
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Very simple, we also make a so-called

1078
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
transient IR, this is more difficult to do

1079
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Just make an IR, that is, after you type it up

1080
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
then do another

1081
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
With an IR, within fintosecond

1082
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Just put it on the probe

1083
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What can you get?

1084
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You all get this is disappearing, this is generated

1085
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So the generation is this keytone

1086
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
This is the place that disappeared

1087
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
so you know the generation disappears

1088
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Indeed it has been synonymized

1089
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
In fact, we are doing these things

1090
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Basically, it just shows you

1091
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
beautiful beautiful is in this place

1092
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
In fact, we do this thing

1093
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
so you know it's my lab

1094
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
This is my real laboratory

1095
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Synthesize that, of course I also have

1096
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But basically my lab is like this

1097
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Anyway, it's all optics, so why?

1098
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
If you don't believe me, those few

1099
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I also brought here

1100
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
basically just the weirdest

1101
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
These are different

1102
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,600
I can produce different colors

1103
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
For example, just this

1104
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,600
like this

1105
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
should be very red

1106
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
look

1107
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
very orange

1108
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
So it just has to be

1109
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,600
There is Pronchance

1110
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
if you want red

1111
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
that means i'm cheating

1112
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,600
put it here

1113
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
won't fall

1114
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Red is getting harder

1115
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
cheat again

1116
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Lingjian Village they know

1117
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,600
when you get redder

1118
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600
the weaker the glow

1119
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600
but also red

1120
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
let's take a look

1121
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
just tell you one thing

1122
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
If

1123
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
any small piece

1124
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
this place

1125
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
a lot of optics

1126
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
a lot of lenses

1127
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,600
per lens

1128
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Probably less than 30,000

1129
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
We spend about five or six million together

1130
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
basically

1131
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It cost about five or six million yuan just to change.

1132
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
definitely above ok

1133
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
So you know it costs nothing to say this

1134
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
ok let's see

1135
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
that can just say

1136
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
if today this is sour

1137
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
it will come

1138
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
then you have an idea

1139
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
the idea is

1140
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
you can't control it

1141
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
mutual energy

1142
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So actually I am in this 20

1143
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
About 3 years ago 4 years ago

1144
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
the idea is

1145
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
just very very just

1146
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
can i control it

1147
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
control it to

1148
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It was one sided

1149
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
ok can i turn it into yes

1150
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's a thing called equilibrium

1151
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is that it is balanced

1152
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
ok actually we were in 2011

1153
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
also make it really balance

1154
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
ok let's not talk more

1155
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Just talk to you like this Kang Fat

1156
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
after a light

1157
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
it can come here

1158
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
If you can also ventilate

1159
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
it side

1160
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
via magnet transfer

1161
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You can go here, you can go here

1162
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
so you know

1163
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
one is 450

1164
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
one is 600

1165
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Adding together is white light

1166
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So we can also make white light out

1167
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So we are a single molecule

1168
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
can make a white light

1169
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,400
not very efficient

1170
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
But last month when we

1171
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,600
has developed another

1172
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,760
wow that game is even better

1173
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,340
OK

1174
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,340
That is pure white light

1175
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,040
Can reach more than 6%

1176
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,140
OK then I won't talk much

1177
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,840
OK because that hasn't been published yet

1178
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,640
so i can't speak

1179
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,340
i can only say

1180
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,900
this is absolutely possible

1181
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,800
You see, with this thing a single molecule

1182
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,540
I can do white light

1183
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,540
because of the ease of passing

1184
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,540
OK basically

1185
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,900
it's a rare phenomenon

1186
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,540
OK

1187
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,200
From this basic point of view

1188
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,960
what are we doing

1189
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,760
Actually, I have one that is challenging the Invasion Sword

1190
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,360
straight transfer limit

1191
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,600
what do you mean look

1192
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,760
Just talked about the first example

1193
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,800
This natural five

1194
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,760
this is the five rings

1195
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,460
i lose to you

1196
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,100
1 2 3 4 5

1197
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:43,060
A total of five round papers constitute the Invasion Sword

1198
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,460
That this red man just now

1199
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,360
is 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 rings

1200
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:47,900
OK

1201
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,760
The six rings you can be OH and N

1202
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,700
You can also be N

1203
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,060
You can also be N and NH

1204
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,660
This is fine, the six rings

1205
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,200
OK

1206
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Seven rings is what I just said

1207
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
So-called

1208
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,940
so-called fluorescent proteins

1209
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,040
move it OH over here

1210
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, the seven-membered ring

1211
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,740
Let's talk about where the limit is

1212
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,000
So we spent a year

1213
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,680
This session is challenging and fun

1214
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,840
Basically we make eight-membered rings

1215
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,640
The answer is, teacher, how do you do this?

1216
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,840
let me tell you okay

1217
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,040
In my laboratory is my design

1218
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,840
I'll come over after I finish designing

1219
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,140
can this be done

1220
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,540
The answer says to start looking for basically

1221
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,040
so you know i'm mistaken

1222
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,380
But I just talked to Vice President Wang

1223
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,880
I have a team dedicated to compositing

1224
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
There are three post stars in charge of this thing

1225
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,840
just do it

1226
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,080
I design can you do it

1227
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,980
In the end, what we made was an eight-membered ring.

1228
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,480
The eight-membered ring emits about 700

1229
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,680
Already very weak very weak but it is there

1230
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,280
Is there a nine-membered ring?

1231
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
In fact, I have already designed it and can't make it.

1232
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,680
Then see what you do along the way

1233
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
a few rings

1234
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,980
it's an interesting thing

1235
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,080
Now we're making eight-membered rings

1236
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,280
The eight-membered ring should be the current limit.

1237
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,180
basically

1238
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,980
That's what I just said

1239
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,980
Probably more OH

1240
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
OK, is there any other Bounding recently?

1241
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,000
I just said that N is also okay, right?

1242
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Then why is this important? You see, what we are developing now is more important.

1243
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
What is the reason? Just now OH you also know that one O can only have two sticks

1244
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Right, but N is different

1245
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
If there is an H on the N side, there is an H on this side, you can broaden your horizons

1246
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
to do so-called modification, chemical modification

1247
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
This is important because NH2 is not acidic enough

1248
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
In fact, NH2 is a bit alkaline and not acidic enough.

1249
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So here we design a pull electron

1250
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
OK pull very strongly, such as Tosio Group

1251
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Let's not talk too much, just like this group

1252
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
OK is a SOO

1253
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Like this, this, if this pulls electrons very strongly

1254
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
After pulling this, what can this place do? It's sour.

1255
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
it can do direct transfer

1256
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So you see we use chemical modification to modify it and we can do it

1257
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
OK basically speaking so you know what to say

1258
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
How sour or not sour are we doing this way

1259
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Why, why, why, we can tune it to connect with each other

1260
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
What can we tune in now? It’s the same as before

1261
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Better yet, we're rationalizing Tune to white light

1262
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,560
So in this way you hear the white light

1263
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,120
This combines synthetic

1264
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,160
everything together and apply

1265
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,960
So definitely something to do in this place

1266
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,000
It can be said that chemistry is actually a family.

1267
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,060
It's up to you how to interpret it

1268
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,100
Basically it's one thing you can do

1269
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,400
I give an example

1270
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,200
This example lets you examine

1271
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,740
what am i doing now

1272
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,280
because of course since

1273
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,600
After the National Science Council is changed to the Ministry of Science and Technology, you have to do some applications

1274
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,640
Otherwise you will be KO basically speaking

1275
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,180
Then let me tell you about an application

1276
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,960
it's fun

1277
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,280
what is this application

1278
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,300
we look at one thing

1279
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,840
if today

1280
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,400
The screen we're looking at

1281
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,440
This screen is called the absorption screen

1282
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,260
Keep playing a color and let you see the color over there

1283
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,280
right

1284
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,080
If you imagine this screen

1285
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,360
is transparent

1286
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,640
transparent

1287
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,180
But there is RGB inside

1288
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,240
There are Blue and Green and Red

1289
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,040
The dye is in three layers

1290
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,060
OK

1291
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,100
and then yours

1292
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:55,860
your this

1293
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,640
Where's your projector?

1294
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,900
actually every color in it

1295
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
When you load your picture into it

1296
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,360
it came out

1297
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:03,960
according to the diagram

1298
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,360
In fact, there are three UV light

1299
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,200
This UV light is invisible

1300
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,240
call here

1301
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,200
A light hit is for you blue

1302
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,960
one light hit one green

1303
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,800
a light to red

1304
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,640
OK

1305
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,360
you regulate according to this

1306
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,160
you know what to say

1307
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,360
In this way, it is a full-color

1308
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,760
Full color transparent screen

1309
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,560
Now it's the hottest

1310
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,600
OK basically speaking

1311
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,760
is completely transparent

1312
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,160
but now do so far

1313
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,960
no

1314
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,800
what is the reason

1315
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,360
They all use fluorescent powder

1316
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,080
Phosphor powder is very unhappy

1317
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,280
very blurred

1318
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,920
OK

1319
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,560
basic

1320
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,480
Now the most famous is the inside of the car

1321
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,360
look inside this car

1322
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,880
On top of this Winds Shear

1323
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,080
Whatever the light-shielding glass is for?

1324
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,720
These

1325
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,320
OK

1326
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,440
is above

1327
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,360
right here there is one like this

1328
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,280
There is a Project

1329
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,080
This Project is a Project

1330
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:50,880
you see it's all green

1331
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,000
Why else is it red?

1332
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,600
It can't do full color

1333
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,440
Because technically it doesn't work

1334
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,360
OK technically it doesn't work

1335
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,000
Why

1336
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,760
very simple

1337
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,920
If you don't show it

1338
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,760
You call Blue, will Blue get Red in this place?

1339
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
meeting

1340
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,460
Why? Because you have Red means there will be in Blue

1341
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,160
So you can never get past this level

1342
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,860
How do you get past this level? Can’t you just talk about it?

1343
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,760
Inward direct transfer is absolutely possible

1344
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,760
Why? Because the direct transfer is released by Cyub in the place of Red and Green

1345
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,160
So I know where to go to find my inner light

1346
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,560
Then blue is enough to use ordinary blue

1347
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,760
too much, ok

1348
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,420
Then this place you see when I fire up in Red

1349
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,320
This place I get is such a long wavelength

1350
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,720
Right when it was Green I got to be in this place

1351
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,160
So this place is not absorbed, so just bypass

1352
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,420
i can see three

1353
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,320
Well, if you don't believe me, I just put these two in

1354
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:47,120
OK, put three layers, you can't see the three layers, but it's transparent

1355
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,620
OK, take a look

1356
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,820
I know 380 is Green

1357
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,020
To 400, this color is not good, OK, it should be Red

1358
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,020
to 420 is Blue

1359
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,580
You see, long wavelengths get short wavelengths

1360
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,080
Yes, long wavelengths get long wavelengths

1361
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
Cutting these three together is white light

1362
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,000
OK so don't underestimate it

1363
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,600
Maybe I will be the billionaire chairman in the future

1364
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,440
OK this could be

1365
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,440
just tell you look

1366
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,800
This is a basic science

1367
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,040
But he can use it

1368
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,040
he can definitely use it

1369
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,240
just tell you the truth

1370
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,840
actually i tell you

1371
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,400
fondamento is really important

1372
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,400
OK we're just fondamento

1373
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,400
not this far

1374
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,040
so everyone said

1375
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,240
ah why do what

1376
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,560
you just have to get to a certain point

1377
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,640
In fact, you must be rich

1378
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,160
In fact, we have not reached this point

1379
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,440
So it's always stuck in this place

1380
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,360
okay, let me tell you

1381
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,560
it might be ok

1382
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,520
then don't forget

1383
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,760
Just that grape palm tree

1384
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
What are these things for?

1385
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,400
Hey, it took more than twenty years

1386
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,960
right not two months

1387
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,920
not two years

1388
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,280
right so of course

1389
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,280
ok let's see

1390
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,320
the shift that inspires here

1391
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,920
intermolecular

1392
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,440
I give an example

1393
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,120
Just started with five-membered rings

1394
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,280
It is impossible to make a gold rod with a four-membered ring

1395
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,240
Right, four-membered ring one two three four is impossible

1396
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,600
Impossible to say this H and Z

1397
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,280
Because of four impossible things

1398
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,480
how it was formed and made a gold rod

1399
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,600
Hey let's see

1400
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,600
It's between Dimer and it's double

1401
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,560
right this and this

1402
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,520
You can also see

1403
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,600
I won't show once I'm excited, I'll tell you

1404
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,200
Once activated, this Proton can come over

1405
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,000
This Proton can come

1406
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Two, we call them Double Proton Transmitter

1407
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Just switch two Protons together

1408
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
what green light you can get too

1409
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
OK, so why is the Study so hard?

1410
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
did that just tell you

1411
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
look at some of our examples

1412
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Let's take a look at the knowledge transfer in the DNA clipping team

1413
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Can it happen? And entry produces mutations

1414
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
This is 40 years, 50 years

1415
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Wasn't and Click from this Wasn't

1416
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
everyone is discussing this

1417
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
OK, is it possible to mutate

1418
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Because these two Proton

1419
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
OK, these two Protons

1420
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
After hearing this, these two Double Proton

1421
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
When Proton comes with Switch, it needs to be flexible and easy to buy.

1422
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Then start copying at this place

1423
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
there is a copy error

1424
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Actually this Wasn't the first to bring it up

1425
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
He said is it possible that

1426
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
OK, that's easy from here

1427
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
We want Study to say

1428
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Is it possible that after the light is

1429
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Let the two ProtonSwitch

1430
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
OK, generate Mutation

1431
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
This is also me in 1990

1432
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
to 19 in about 2001, what about these 10 years

1433
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,500
My focus is very strong in this place

1434
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,660
I spend almost half of my manpower on this place

1435
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,100
Because there were fewer people at that time

1436
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,820
But half of the people spent in this place

1437
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,920
It's a pity to tell you no

1438
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,000
you see why not

1439
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,920
I can tell the simplest truth now

1440
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,220
after you shine

1441
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,860
If you say this proteon is going to pass

1442
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:19,920
This proteon is coming

1443
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,160
I'm sorry that this synonym is too much

1444
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,420
This is also synonymous

1445
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,600
Two synonymous transition energy is too high

1446
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,920
impossible

1447
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,300
so why do i know

1448
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,760
Because what do we do, it won't work, right?

1449
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,980
But let's take a very simple acid touch

1450
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,980
We stuck acid in this place

1451
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,760
If you get stuck at Adning

1452
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,320
Contact acid can be used to form Diamond

1453
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,080
How do you know it's a Diamond

1454
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,260
Because it can be seen from the absorption

1455
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,220
I won't draw it

1456
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,060
It forms a Diamond with my light

1457
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,280
it produces a green glow

1458
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,060
And red or green shine

1459
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,480
just tell you one thing is

1460
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,160
In fact, this can be proteon switch

1461
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,160
no problem

1462
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,360
Then, teacher, what is the difference between here and here?

1463
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,580
Where is the difference

1464
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,460
You see, this is the change of both

1465
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
This is the subject is the subject, anyway both will change

1466
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,800
But what about this, if this is the subject of the project?

1467
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
The main body has changed, has the topic changed or not?

1468
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,300
Why because COH is still COH

1469
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,300
OK, I didn’t name this one Catalytic Time

1470
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,800
Actually when I sent out the first one in 1999

1471
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
Oh, what about that Propel Jax

1472
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
Come back in a week and say incredible

1473
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
how do you think of such a thing

1474
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Ah, this is, ah, why do you keep talking about 1999?

1475
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,800
OK someone over here should know

1476
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
Because there were no instruments at that time

1477
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,300
And why not after a while because of the big earthquake

1478
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,800
In Chung Cheng University OK later the instrument was burned

1479
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,800
So there is nothing, nothing depends on the brain

1480
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,300
Just us, you have nothing to do, just rely on your brain

1481
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,800
OK, just think about these things in your head, it's not healthy

1482
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,800
Let's see if it's possible, right? No need for instruments.

1483
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,300
You can still do it so I'll tell you

1484
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,300
Rely on your brain when you have no money

1485
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,300
OK, your brain will always figure it out

1486
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,300
Of course, what Dean Wang said is correct, because I am a workaholic

1487
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,800
So basically I can't learn it, just thinking here OK

1488
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,300
You see, after the big earthquake

1489
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,800
More than a year, published three consecutive days OK

1490
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
Everything is the simplest concept

1491
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I didn't lie to you, it's just a concept

1492
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Nothing to do, just do the simplest things like this

1493
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
OK, so we're going to call it Catalyst type

1494
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
OK, that's the catalyst, because it doesn't move

1495
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
This is not called catalysis, so it won't work

1496
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
it's that simple

1497
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
ok , then i will give you a better example

1498
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Let's start from here

1499
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
How to derive it? You see

1500
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
we derive, for example, we synthesize

1501
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You said that the synthesis is not difficult, not difficult

1502
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Because he has already synthesized it, but he doesn't want to do it

1503
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
OK, I'll do it from this place, ah, it works

1504
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Why is it useful, you see this place for the same reason

1505
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You see, Acoho or water words

1506
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
If it's Acoho water, you see

1507
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
If this stuck in this place, a fire

1508
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's still the same, Acoho is still Acoho, but this will change

1509
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
OK, if that's the case

1510
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Because people dropped him from this Urea

1511
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
They are synthesized to remove Urea's derivatives

1512
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I said, ah, how to do this

1513
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
This is obviously in Acoho water

1514
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It should be easy to buy

1515
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Because both will change

1516
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So it won't, so it should be no entry

1517
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
This should be Rate

1518
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
in organic people do this stuff

1519
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
just watch normal MMA

1520
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Just take a look, right?

1521
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
This should be Blue, this should be Rate

1522
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Is there such a possibility?

1523
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I say learn to synthesize

1524
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
OK, this is not a very difficult thing

1525
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So they start to synthesize

1526
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
After the synthesis is completed, you can see

1527
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
but we added a group

1528
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
We added a COO group

1529
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Why? Because it is better to make it water soluble

1530
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
OK, look, in the water

1531
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
600

1532
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
so my consciousness is right

1533
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
My consciousness, well, my consciousness can just talk

1534
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I am better than people without this knowledge

1535
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It's 10 times more likely, that's all I am

1536
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
As long as the chance of winning is 10 times, or 100 times, that's all

1537
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
OK, I can’t say they’re all right, if you can’t make them all, then you can’t

1538
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I can't help it either

1539
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
OK, but like this

1540
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
OK, let's force it in later

1541
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
look what it looks like

1542
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
After the card is in, eh, it’s gone

1543
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yes, so this is a RUN concept

1544
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
nothing

1545
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Hey, let me tell you, okay?

1546
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I didn't even measure the spectrum.

1547
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Just take one photo, and there is no equipment

1548
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Just shine like this, shine like this

1549
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Super published, OK, basically speaking

1550
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
It's just a matter of concept, it's an obvious thing

1551
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Tell me, hey, it works

1552
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
ok we'll be back

1553
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,600
This just this India

1554
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,200
Yes, Morigata Ajaw, this place in India

1555
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,600
Didn't you just say that Dimer is okay?

1556
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,800
Well if Dimer can

1557
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,900
That can also be done in Ako

1558
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:07,800
Of course not wrong

1559
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,200
Look inside Ako

1560
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,200
this is in

1561
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,000
This time in Cyco Accent in that Langpora

1562
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,600
There is no software in Proton

1563
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,800
it is a light

1564
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,000
But in Ako there are only two lights

1565
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,800
what is this

1566
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,600
This is the oversynthesis of it

1567
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,600
Make a catalytic reaction from this place

1568
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,600
come this way

1569
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,000
OK good

1570
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,600
don't do a magic trick in this place

1571
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,400
look at this

1572
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,600
this is more fun

1573
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,800
This place has Ako

1574
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,600
so i am

1575
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
I casually

1576
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,200
Come on, let's take this example

1577
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,600
Look, this bottle is

1578
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,000
It's also transparent, right?

1579
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,200
Habits of transparency

1580
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,400
This might turn off the lights

1581
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,600
wait a minute

1582
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,500
OK look

1583
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,400
Then this time in Cyco Accent

1584
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,900
I know a little bit of Ako

1585
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,800
Super Sensitive

1586
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,600
Era-6M Lipstick

1587
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,800
it becomes like this

1588
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,200
It is OK that it combines super strong

1589
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,000
basically

1590
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,800
so let's see

1591
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,000
The answer is how it looks OK

1592
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,900
what about this

1593
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,800
as soon as you shine

1594
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,700
OK this

1595
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,500
After you shine on the light, you basically talk

1596
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,600
it is probably

1597
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,100
no

1598
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,020
Why? Because it shines at 360, 350, can't see

1599
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,860
OK, you can't see, basically

1600
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,840
good

1601
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,640
I'm doing a show now

1602
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:10,420
I haven't moved this can, don't say I cheated, I'll take a look

1603
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,220
what is this ? beer

1604
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,480
I put this can here

1605
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,980
i open the beer

1606
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,480
Can't drink, can't open, can't open

1607
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,480
hold on , ok , look on

1608
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,720
I didn't paint it

1609
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,720
ok ok ok enough , enough of the booze

1610
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,220
it should be soon, ok

1611
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,720
Because of chemistry, this saves unlimited Diffusion Control

1612
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,720
It's all coming soon, look

1613
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,220
fast enough, ok

1614
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,720
Question 16, 16M, whatever you do

1615
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,720
You said that when you pass the place where the tide is drunk, you will be killed

1616
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,220
Detecting alcohol trucks, it's impossible

1617
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,720
So this is free, OK

1618
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,720
and it breaks so it doesn't work

1619
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,720
but it can

1620
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
no problem at all

1621
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,500
A lot of fun

1622
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,700
Okay, more exciting next time, let's take a look

1623
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,000
So the single thing is

1624
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
If you use this structure

1625
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What about the water?

1626
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
just arco

1627
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
water

1628
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
As soon as we look like water, we'll be fine.

1629
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,500
water is not good

1630
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,000
glow of water

1631
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
This absorbing light is right here

1632
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
without this pack

1633
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
This package is only available in arco

1634
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
why not water

1635
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'll tell you one thing why not

1636
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in the water

1637
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
no matter what

1638
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Because of acidity and alkalinity

1639
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Everyone knows this NH

1640
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
blood flow know

1641
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
The NH of this steak in this NH is not sour

1642
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
OK

1643
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
so how to say

1644
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
butyric acid

1645
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
When the H drops and changes to this side

1646
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
what this becomes

1647
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Weak acid is strong

1648
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
so im sorry

1649
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
When I was waiting for the first phase of PH

1650
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It Protonate Immediately

1651
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
so it doesn't shine

1652
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
there is nothing you can do

1653
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
what can you turn it into

1654
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
turn it into

1655
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
This place makes it a bit more acidic

1656
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Its resistance is always weakened

1657
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
it's possible in the water

1658
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,440
Look, I just thought of this concept, right?

1659
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,240
Chemistry is just like that, right?

1660
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,540
So how do you turn it into a stronger acid

1661
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,640
not easy

1662
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,540
You can do whatever you want, as long as Mr. Lin comes over and say

1663
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,040
At that time you just didn't design

1664
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,640
It's simple, just pull the electron

1665
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,640
It is more acidic to design a pull electron

1666
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,840
Let's design a pull electron

1667
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,540
It will be more acidic for the design to pull electrons

1668
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:22,340
Sour its conjugate and it will become dissolved

1669
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,740
it will not be protonin

1670
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,840
Is the answer like this?

1671
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,240
The answer is really like this

1672
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,540
OK this is totally OK to sell the concept

1673
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,240
So what was published at that time

1674
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,580
two pages per page

1675
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,080
Anyway, it’s OK to sell concepts

1676
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,780
Just look at it and add a CA.

1677
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,380
It was only this

1678
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,480
this is what

1679
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,780
it's this one that shines like this

1680
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,480
such a simple thing

1681
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,780
OK, I won't talk about this

1682
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,080
It's okay for you to sleep when you talk about this

1683
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,680
just tell you if it will be like this

1684
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,840
OK basically

1685
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,240
How about this project?

1686
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,980
Since I came to National Taiwan University

1687
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,880
Wang Yifu gave a speech just now. I went there in 2001

1688
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,340
OK to go basically

1689
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,540
What about since 2002?

1690
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,040
because

1691
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,560
all the materials

1692
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,060
OK so the answer is

1693
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,840
From 2002 to 2008

1694
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,440
I'm out of my research focus

1695
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,840
What about adding

1696
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,800
what indole group

1697
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,640
I will stop

1698
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,100
I'll switch lanes

1699
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,340
OK actually I posted on TV Shine

1700
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,840
With the new generation of solar cells

1701
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,400
Paypal is too much

1702
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,400
OK basically I won't talk today

1703
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,540
OK basically speaking

1704
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,840
i think some people know ok

1705
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,740
So the answer is to switch the direction

1706
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,640
But I will not talk about this direction today

1707
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,440
what am i going to say

1708
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,540
OK because after 2009

1709
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,040
I restarted this

1710
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,900
why start this thing

1711
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,900
Because

1712
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,300
What about 2009?

1713
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,900
I set up a program called

1714
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,600
poster-glanding team

1715
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,900
Wow this sounds very

1716
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,300
It seems that men's things are OK

1717
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,500
It's the social affairs team

1718
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
OK, is it not me?

1719
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,600
But the members of the social affairs line group said

1720
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,500
two female teachers

1721
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,900
OK so full of embarrassment

1722
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,400
basically

1723
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,100
Then why is it called the Social Affairs Line Group?

1724
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,400
Because we are studying the social affairs line

1725
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,100
of this

1726
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,900
It is poster-glanding

1727
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,300
Just poster-glanding this

1728
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,700
The mechanism of this synthesis

1729
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,500
OK, let me give you a few examples.

1730
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,300
let's see

1731
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,400
This is the so-called poster-glanding

1732
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,900
This is it

1733
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,280
How did PGH2 come about?

1734
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,820
from fatty acids

1735
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,120
OK after Cyclooxygenase

1736
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,120
After OK and Poxidase

1737
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,280
It's over here by Poxidase

1738
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,120
then after

1739
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,640
only two two

1740
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,600
One is Pgis which is antithrombin

1741
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,760
OK one is Somboxxan Sinceres

1742
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,560
thrombin

1743
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,960
These two are checks and balances

1744
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,000
checks and balances

1745
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,520
I give an example

1746
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,040
for example

1747
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,040
You are hurt

1748
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,040
There are a bunch of these in the platelets

1749
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,360
thrombin

1750
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,040
why

1751
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,000
because it will be what

1752
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,520
Immediately blown into blood acid

1753
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,720
what makes you condense

1754
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,720
OK if you have a heart block

1755
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,480
or why

1756
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,360
you need to pass

1757
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,560
OK is antithrombin

1758
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,040
To this side, it becomes the front row ring number

1759
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,000
then let you what

1760
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,360
let you this place is accessible

1761
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,840
So these two are checks and balances

1762
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:39,800
over here

1763
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,480
in fact to be honest

1764
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,600
Even X-ray knows

1765
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,120
OK this

1766
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,320
the antithrombin

1767
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,760
Its structure is known

1768
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,400
I don't know this place

1769
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,200
why don't you know

1770
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,280
Because of its large active center

1771
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,560
So I can't get my body out

1772
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,400
I know that felt from National Taiwan University

1773
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,160
what felt

1774
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:55,200
Where is felt

1775
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,560
OK I've been trying to get it but I can't

1776
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,200
OK basically

1777
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,320
so this place is

1778
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,080
it has its

1779
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,600
its place as

1780
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,960
we are researching this place

1781
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,760
After all because it all belongs to Satocon P450

1782
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,000
There is HIM and that straight

1783
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,600
so straight up

1784
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,040
We can use Lyman spectroscopy to study that

1785
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,200
How did it change after it entered?

1786
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,600
we will study this

1787
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,400
That's because it's related to Poscagetin

1788
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,200
related to color wireless

1789
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Let's ask the color wireless team

1790
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,200
you know

1791
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
What do you want to relieve the pain?

1792
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,200
Everyone use the rainy forehead below to relieve the pain

1793
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,600
Everyone knows the best pain reliever

1794
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,800
If you go to the hospital and say I'm dying of pain

1795
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,600
I'll tell you about the hospital

1796
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,400
If the doctor said you could die

1797
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,800
Just give you cox

1798
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,400
Inhibitor for you cox

1799
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,800
block this place

1800
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,600
Make sure you don't have any pain

1801
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
you take one without pain

1802
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,400
Basically this is the most upstream

1803
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,900
so you see that you say cox

1804
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,000
like every time i go to say give me a cox inhibitor

1805
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,600
After this time, I guarantee you will have no pain at all

1806
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,600
basically

1807
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,800
Then why is there no pain? It’s not good anymore

1808
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,300
Because of your natural disaster or something

1809
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,400
You don't even know what your body is doing

1810
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,100
let me tell you first we have this

1811
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,100
you say this to me

1812
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,460
Because what did I have to do with it just now?

1813
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:02,500
has a lot to do with

1814
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,700
OK, let's study these two

1815
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,000
OK it all belongs to P

1816
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,700
That Satocon P450's

1817
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,300
Just have a Sorayband

1818
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,200
Because it has Porphine

1819
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,800
straight this place

1820
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,700
In fact, we have studied a lot of Raman

1821
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,900
I won't talk about it, I won't talk about it

1822
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,200
Let me tell you about the Raman spectrum

1823
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,700
When this sub-save comes in

1824
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,500
OK its spectrum changes

1825
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,600
changes over time

1826
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,200
OK let's study it

1827
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,200
its Lyman spectrum

1828
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:23,800
just these things

1829
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,300
OK then this is not important

1830
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,300
the most important thing is

1831
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,000
when we study this

1832
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,200
When Somboxan Synthesis

1833
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,000
OK we just found out one thing

1834
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,500
A lot of fun

1835
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,600
It has a total of five Trip Open

1836
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,500
There are always five Trip Opens in it

1837
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,900
What about these five Trip Opens?

1838
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,700
Just five tryptophan five tryptophan

1839
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:41,900
What about the five cromotropins?

1840
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,600
Basically it's 1 2

1841
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,900
W means Trip Open OK

1842
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,000
This student's pictorial text is clearer than me OK

1843
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,100
1 2 3 4 5

1844
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,600
These five Trip Open

1845
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,800
What about these five Trip Opens?

1846
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,100
One thing that can obviously be said is

1847
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,900
When we use these just this

1848
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,200
What is Laman Spectrum doing?

1849
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,400
we already know that

1850
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,800
Actually, what about the four blue places?

1851
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,260
is very polar

1852
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,400
This place is practically almost non-polar

1853
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,400
We know it has almost no polarity

1854
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:07,000
OK

1855
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,300
We use various spectra

1856
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,100
We all know this has no polarity

1857
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,000
but we don't know

1858
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,600
What is the reason for this lack of polarity?

1859
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,100
because there is no water or nothing

1860
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,300
no X-ray

1861
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,100
X-ray is useless

1862
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:16,900
X-ray to see water

1863
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,300
Teacher Wang knows that looking at the water is useless

1864
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,600
OK so everyone one thing is

1865
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,500
We know this W65 is here

1866
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,900
Then, when Postakening came in like this

1867
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,400
When PGH2 came in like this

1868
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,700
actually it's still passing here

1869
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,200
That's a fatty acid

1870
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,200
So it must be very Lumpol

1871
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,400
There should be no water in this place

1872
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,000
it has a way to survive

1873
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,900
Then of course the other four

1874
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:37,800
we think there is water

1875
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:38,700
Excuse me

1876
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,700
How do you know if there is water or not?

1877
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,400
This is the question everyone is asking

1878
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,400
OK, where is the water in Portain?

1879
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,000
where is there no water

1880
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,300
one thing I didn't know

1881
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:46,700
So I just do this challenge saying

1882
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,900
I'm going to challenge these things

1883
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
how do i challenge

1884
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:49,800
let's look good

1885
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,000
We said there is no way to propane this water

1886
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
This surrounding of water is in Trotopen

1887
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:55,600
we thought of it

1888
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,500
Isn't Trotopen like this?

1889
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,300
right

1890
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,400
if i am here

1891
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,000
no matter where

1892
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,740
Change to x4, otherwise how to change

1893
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,740
Is there a way this place can Sensing water

1894
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,440
If possible, its socket is almost the same as it

1895
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
Can I use Protin's Expression

1896
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,740
For example, feed Ecolite as nutrients

1897
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,740
Can it become an Unnatural Protin after eating it?

1898
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,940
OK, is there a possibility? Mutant's Protin

1899
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,740
Is it possible? I'll fix this first.

1900
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,940
is there anything

1901
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,940
That’s why I didn’t talk about it just now, just pull the electrons here, right?

1902
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,540
Just pull the electrons here.

1903
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,240
Sorry, it's on the mountain

1904
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,440
It just happened that your Amino-S needs to be synthesized in this place

1905
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,540
so no way no way

1906
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,840
then you can make it through

1907
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,640
We want the good, halloween says, from the bad, where to add acid

1908
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,340
Yes, change Time to N here

1909
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,240
Yes, if you change Time to N

1910
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,240
this place must be sour

1911
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,240
We were the first to think it must be sour

1912
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,240
so is it possible to come from here to this place

1913
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,240
Sorry, this was two and a half years ago

1914
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,240
Just tell Vice President Wang

1915
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,240
I will talk to Chen Ping or the concept

1916
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,240
Chen Ping said you Kiss this can't be synthesized

1917
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,240
acid

1918
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,200
I rushed in and said that there is no way to combine them, and I will show you.

1919
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,200
basically

1920
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,200
So the answer is that I organize a team

1921
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,200
just start looking

1922
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,700
According to two or three months later, it is possible

1923
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,700
so we just let it go

1924
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,200
You see we still made it

1925
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,200
Let me make one, two, three, four, and five

1926
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,200
basically i'm peak camp

1927
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,200
So this is related to organic physicochemical analysis

1928
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,600
What volume has what peak relationship

1929
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:28,000
Just do it, basically

1930
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,400
So the answer can be made

1931
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,400
And we can also make is only l seam

1932
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,400
no problem at all

1933
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,400
basically speaking

1934
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,400
so made it

1935
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,400
The answer is can it?

1936
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,400
The answer is that it is really possible after it is illuminated

1937
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,400
Does water have a wave circle or something?

1938
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,400
The answer is that one thing is really done for me.

1939
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,400
Basically, you can see that the spectrum we made looks like this

1940
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,400
I'll tell you, it's very simple

1941
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,400
The result we made is

1942
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
n1 has the possibility of H n2 has the possibility of H

1943
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,400
It doesn't matter, this protein 98

1944
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
This protein 2 will turn green after G8

1945
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,400
there are these two these two are this

1946
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,400
This is my non-protein transfer

1947
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,600
Shine with protein transfer

1948
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,700
this is n2

1949
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:06,800
so all three have

1950
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,400
Then you say teacher, how do you know which one?

1951
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,300
We will synthesize n7A3 in 2

1952
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:13,300
n7A3 in 1's

1953
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,600
We can then compare the spectra

1954
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,500
the answer is right

1955
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,300
so we know that

1956
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,400
it can really be water

1957
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,000
That is, you can go to probe water

1958
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,800
right in the water

1959
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,400
in the water

1960
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,800
So it's really possible to probe

1961
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,700
Then of course we will take this

1962
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,300
就wake it equalize

1963
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,500
OK of course it is

1964
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,700
The answer to one thing is

1965
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,200
Because we are using expression

1966
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,600
Do this and you will know

1967
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,900
So we have five words

1968
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:37,700
terribly sorry

1969
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,000
if we are single

1970
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,400
what about the other four

1971
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,500
we because we don't

1972
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,900
know from making protein

1973
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,900
We're not doing that Peter Schuess way

1974
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:47,000
But we're doing Peter Schuess now

1975
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,500
we use that called

1976
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:52,400
that that that that that

1977
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,800
The way of that amber coden

1978
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,000
OK we used to be the easiest

1979
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,700
If there is only one to become a trip

1980
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,000
For the other four, change it to

1981
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So the double ball will change a bit, but the activity will not change much

1982
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So we do it this way, you see we just replace every

1983
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
replace each one, crystal energy thing happened

1984
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
When we replaced him, we found out that you see this in the water

1985
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Three, but in Porting there are two

1986
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,000
N2 is missing, why? Because the water inside is not Bock water

1987
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So this N2 is gone, that is, Equilibrium is gone

1988
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
If you don't see it, there are two. It doesn't matter if there are two, there must be water.

1989
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
There must be water, this catalysis, but the place of W65

1990
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
If W65 is replaced by ours, no, 0

1991
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
just no water, really no water

1992
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So using this place, I can probe and say, oh! This porting is in this part of W65

1993
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
This Si'an acid has no water, and the others have water, OK

1994
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I won’t tell you about other things, other places have water, OK

1995
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Then you say, hey! Then how accurate is this? It’s very simple, you see! After I put Dinatio

1996
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
After taking this SomboxinDinatio, it's back to three roots

1997
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Dinatio catches all the water, he's coming back

1998
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,540
So of course it's incredible

1999
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,460
Which means I can really go pub water with this

2000
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,540
So I throw this out

2001
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,540
Actually sorry we lost it to Nature

2002
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,540
Nature saved eight months

2003
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,700
tell us you want

2004
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,580
At least three or four examples

2005
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,340
For each example, we have to do it for at least half a year to a year

2006
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,780
Three or four need to be done for two years

2007
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,740
no time to wait

2008
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:20,540
basically

2009
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,980
we say we don't have time to wait

2010
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:22,780
he said no time to wait

2011
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,180
We will recommend you to Nature Communication

2012
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,700
So publish Nature Communication

2013
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,380
Basically they are very

2014
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,780
very surprise

2015
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,980
Say oh, you can pub

2016
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,180
water in pub protein

2017
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,180
Let's continue to look down

2018
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,780
So the catastrophe temperature is in this place

2019
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,380
1. Where does protein water exist?

2020
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:41,780
What is its structure near the active site

2021
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:42,980
It's interesting

2022
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,380
Whether these water molecules form a clear mass

2023
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,980
The specificity of the structure and the resulting dynamics

2024
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,380
Are structural changes related to protein activity?

2025
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,780
How to perform hydration reaction during protein finishing?

2026
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,380
This is one of the things we are most interested in

2027
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:55,780
Basically written in both Chinese and English

2028
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,380
Change it to Chinese this morning

2029
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,780
Tired OK let's see

2030
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,780
So in biochemical reproduction

2031
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
So basically this is why everyone can't figure it out

2032
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
The reason is that so far

2033
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
no direct

2034
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
carbon increase in biochemical moisture content

2035
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Analysis of protein water by X-ray is static

2036
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
OK water quality position is the result of optimization

2037
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
everybody knows

2038
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
basically impossible

2039
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
but we can really go

2040
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Well this year and a half

2041
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
One and a half years since publication

2042
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
We've actually found two examples

2043
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
OK let's give an example

2044
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
This is a very simple

2045
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
just one

2046
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
this

2047
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Rhypo Nucrease

2048
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
OK cuts the RNA

2049
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It only has a Triple Fent

2050
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
As far as the location of W59

2051
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
OK, what about this one?

2052
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
when we go to prop it

2053
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
We also use Protin's Expression

2054
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's better to change one

2055
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
One I don't do anything OK

2056
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
you know we won't talk

2057
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
tell you the result

2058
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'll tell you the result

2059
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
We really prop it dynamic

2060
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
when it does have water

2061
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Do Equilibrium when there is no water

2062
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
This is something no one has ever seen

2063
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
OK we see it Equilibrium

2064
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
What do you say

2065
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
You said that your spectral solution looks like this

2066
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Excuse me, do you really have

2067
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
have

2068
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,400
According to us, teacher Yang Xiaoqing from the Fuda University

2069
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,460
he does a test

2070
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,500
OK let's see this is his Wipe of Neucrase

2071
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,400
I'm looking at these two loops

2072
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,400
In fact it is very loose

2073
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,200
You see every time he is doing evolution

2074
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,560
every time doing this

2075
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,560
he is very loose

2076
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,860
So of course water can run in like this all the time

2077
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,700
After running in, basically talk

2078
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,900
In fact we are prop in this place

2079
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,400
OK so you can tell one thing is

2080
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,600
basically talk

2081
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,800
it slowly water will come out

2082
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,800
OK so it will come out

2083
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:31,500
so maybe one thing

2084
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,000
it does have an in and an out

2085
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
in one out one out

2086
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
action that has been doing

2087
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,900
OK basically

2088
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,000
This is an interesting example

2089
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,200
just tell everyone

2090
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,000
What about the second example?

2091
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,900
We've been doing something more interesting recently

2092
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,100
is doing this Aspirogenase

2093
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,100
So why is Aspirogenase so important

2094
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,400
Everyone knows one thing is

2095
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,900
This is treating it as medicine

2096
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,100
OK it can cure cancer

2097
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:50,800
then why

2098
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,000
Because tumor cells

2099
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,900
basically talk

2100
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:56,800
It is sensitization without Aspirogenase

2101
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,100
OK so that means

2102
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,200
If you wear Aspirogenase outside

2103
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,660
If you change aspargion into aspargionase

2104
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,160
you eat it and it's over

2105
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,760
Why? Because it doesn't turn it into

2106
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,460
so it dies

2107
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:09,340
If you just feed it aspargion it will live

2108
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:11,160
OK, so if you use aspargionase

2109
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,660
After cutting this off, it's basically OK

2110
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,560
Then this aspargionase has two states

2111
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,260
One is called ANSAA type

2112
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,760
One B is Type 1, Type 2

2113
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:21,500
The activity of Type 2 is Type 1

2114
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,760
About 100 times more active

2115
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,460
Let's talk about why we don't understand

2116
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,160
only one

2117
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,200
it only has one

2118
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,660
This chiptopin 68 and chiptopin 66 are in this place

2119
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:31,420
So we said can we pop it?

2120
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:33,120
OK, let's replace it as well

2121
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,660
OK, after doing mutation

2122
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:36,420
We found an incredible thing

2123
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,760
Look, the first red line

2124
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,020
The red line is soboxen

2125
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,020
When there was water in that soboxen just now

2126
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:42,920
Then come on

2127
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,020
no water, this place is waterless

2128
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:45,920
B type is without water

2129
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,520
So 100 times more active is without water

2130
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,360
What's more, this one has water

2131
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,420
But what is it where there is water?

2132
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:53,320
Only 1¾

2133
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,920
So we know this place has water or no water

2134
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,720
You do the equilibrium first

2135
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:56,560
I won't talk much

2136
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,720
All I can say is why this place

2137
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,020
why is this place ok

2138
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,400
its activity is so high

2139
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
because it has no water

2140
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,400
no water and no

2141
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,800
All water relay system words

2142
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,200
it makes this place adjustable

2143
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,600
It is very flexible

2144
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,200
So this place is very active

2145
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,400
For now, we interpret it like this

2146
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,000
we just finished this one

2147
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,800
so everyone one thing

2148
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,400
We think one thing is to say

2149
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,200
the water is half active in this place

2150
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,200
very very important role

2151
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,400
There is no water in this place

2152
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,700
Then let's go to x-ray

2153
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,000
Because both of these have x-ray

2154
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
unbelievable

2155
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
but i don't believe in x-ray

2156
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,800
But there is no water in x-ray

2157
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,400
this place has water

2158
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:32,800
ok

2159
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,600
How accurate is the x-ray

2160
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,400
i don't know

2161
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:34,900
can only talk

2162
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:35,800
the result we made

2163
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:36,800
we go to x-ray

2164
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,800
really like this

2165
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,200
This place really has no water

2166
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,000
there is water in this area

2167
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
ok basically

2168
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,800
So we know one thing is

2169
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:43,600
where it differs is

2170
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,600
there is really no water

2171
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,600
Make another equilibrium

2172
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
ok basically

2173
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,700
then we have sent this to pns

2174
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,600
At least it's starting to save

2175
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,400
ok basically

2176
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,300
just tell you

2177
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,200
water in this place

2178
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,000
play a very, very important role

2179
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,700
ok

2180
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,600
Then you say in this place

2181
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,000
what else can we do

2182
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,400
Let me give you the simplest example, okay?

2183
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,200
let's watch this

2184
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:58,700
this so-called

2185
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,000
In time microbial

2186
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,500
Peptide

2187
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,300
One is melittin

2188
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,240
Shaking

2189
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,000
There is only one Tripdopene in Milatine

2190
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:05,600
at this place

2191
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,560
should be all

2192
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,360
The 26 Amino Acid

2193
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,720
There is a Tripdopene in the middle

2194
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:10,620
OK

2195
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,520
i can replace it

2196
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,160
why change

2197
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,360
because it is a thorn

2198
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,400
it destroys the cell membrane

2199
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,400
But it cuts on the cell membrane

2200
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,000
it cuts on the cell membrane

2201
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
then it breaks a hole

2202
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,920
It dies after a hole is made

2203
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,520
OK, this shot kills basically

2204
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,000
If it is Indolissidine

2205
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,600
this is melittin

2206
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,000
this is melittin

2207
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
This is Indolissidine

2208
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,600
Indolissidine was two years ago

2209
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,400
just what

2210
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,200
Just unblocked

2211
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,200
It is the most useful treatment for Hong Kong feet

2212
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,400
You see, Hong Kong foot was very difficult to treat before, right?

2213
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,200
Now just put it on Indolissidine

2214
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,200
Just paint it on and it'll be fine

2215
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,200
If you are unlucky, you can try

2216
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,600
And those feet and gray paper

2217
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,600
What are you doing?

2218
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,000
fuck you know so touch

2219
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,200
or good luck

2220
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,200
promise to be fine soon

2221
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,200
In the past, it was impossible for any page to be good this year.

2222
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,200
why don't you go back and try

2223
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,200
I promise you this thing is OK

2224
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,400
So when a thing is

2225
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,600
It destroys the entire cell membrane

2226
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,840
Then the microbial dies

2227
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,240
basically in this way

2228
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,280
then this is better

2229
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,040
there is only one

2230
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,000
So we're going to nuke here

2231
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,840
look we look at this thing

2232
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,000
look at this place

2233
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
we are simple

2234
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Because as long as we cut to this place

2235
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,840
This is Haizuo phobic

2236
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,640
no water

2237
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,880
Look when there is no water

2238
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,840
our place

2239
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,440
Change it to our tritophan

2240
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:22,440
Changed to the words of tritophan, the suppression claw of our second district

2241
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,240
Seven seconds after you look in

2242
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,440
this place was supposed to be like this

2243
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,800
grow up like this

2244
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:28,200
Why?

2245
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,280
because there is no water

2246
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,680
This is with water and this is without water

2247
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,680
i can grow up now

2248
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:32,080
OK

2249
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,480
so in seven seconds it goes in

2250
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,280
Then we use a so-called

2251
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,480
cover yellow green tree

2252
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,280
just a guts

2253
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,280
Guts are when the outside meets the inside

2254
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,480
it is different emission

2255
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,080
OK

2256
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,080
So one thing to be

2257
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,880
This seven seconds it cut up

2258
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,480
But it takes 45 seconds

2259
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,480
this will break

2260
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,680
Come in after breaking

2261
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,680
So it is also a beautiful starly

2262
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,480
just tell you

2263
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,080
Its application is Eyeless Buddha Realm

2264
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:52,280
OK

2265
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,680
This is just one of the examples

2266
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,880
just tell you one thing

2267
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,880
Then we will challenge

2268
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,880
What is your challenge?

2269
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,880
i want to challenge this

2270
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:58,280
OK

2271
01:12:58,480 --> 01:12:59,280
but i talk about this stuff

2272
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,080
Everyone eats this bottle

2273
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Like how is it possible

2274
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I want to challenge the protein channel is

2275
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
acroprin

2276
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
ok acroprin recently in Science Nature

2277
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Two days in a row

2278
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
ok, let me tell you that he released the X-ray

2279
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
That's seven water

2280
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Big Dipper Water

2281
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Let's talk here

2282
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
we see it this way

2283
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
After entering, the water

2284
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
ok if we change it to a

2285
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
trip top

2286
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Our artificial trip top

2287
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
how about

2288
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
but everyone eats themselves

2289
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
For example, please, this is membrane protein

2290
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
How could you come out of Isox-ray

2291
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I thought

2292
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I was scolded as a bloody sprinkler, right?

2293
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
The result was scolded

2294
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
in another month

2295
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
People really released his Isox-ray

2296
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
ok so now he can put

2297
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
trunk

2298
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
ok put him out of isox-ray

2299
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
So we've got this now

2300
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
this protocol

2301
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
ok we are doing it now

2302
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
But it's a super challenge

2303
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
because acroprin is too big

2304
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
ok basically speaking

2305
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
OK, what about synthesis?

2306
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
We've been working on this

2307
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
ok all this

2308
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Synthesis of ok

2309
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
why

2310
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Because we want to synthesize this

2311
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
brighter

2312
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
ok more sensitive

2313
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
what

2314
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
So we're developing this thing right now

2315
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
ok i'm here

2316
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
let you breathe

2317
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
ok stop

2318
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
this change the gear

2319
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
what about ok gear

2320
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
The above is more fun. Let me talk about the nano-resistant materials of these semiconductors.

2321
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,960
it's a lot of fun

2322
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,000
so i'm talking about this place now

2323
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
This place is about me from 2002 to 2009

2324
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
OK self-discipline is developing

2325
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
After 2009 I think

2326
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
In fact, my eyesight is enough

2327
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I think this should have been commercialized

2328
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
OK, so after 2010, I actually didn’t publish much

2329
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
what have you been doing

2330
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Do some kind of mass production or something

2331
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
because I think it's supposed to be

2332
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's time to start applying

2333
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Let's see what's interesting about this place

2334
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
The first one, of course, is quantum dots.

2335
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
on the mine road

2336
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
That mine is basically talking

2337
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
When it comes to mining roads, it's actually very simple.

2338
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I'll just give you an example

2339
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
We say vulcanized

2340
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
or petrified

2341
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
or shaved septum

2342
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
OK these things please

2343
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
This NASA has been using since 50 years ago

2344
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
What's so strange, it's made of solar panels or something

2345
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It's something everyone knows, right?

2346
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
But have you ever seen these things glow?

2347
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Did you light it? Impossible

2348
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
isn't it? does it shine when you shine it? it's metallic

2349
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Just like the semi-conductive metal that Dürr's luster

2350
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
If you shine more light on it, it will become hotter

2351
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
So why is it like this? Why isn't it glowing?

2352
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
A very simple thing, let me give you an example, which involves

2353
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
The so-called machine problem is called excitement

2354
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
As far as the machine is concerned, let me give you the simplest example

2355
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,000
For example, optimistic, red and white as CDSE or CDS

2356
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It doesn't matter, that is, it has formed a CDSE

2357
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
The fast material of semiconductor is good

2358
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
As for the fast material, if I arouse

2359
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Once excited, an electron

2360
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Kick from this ground state to the kickstand

2361
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
There is a game in semiconductors, kick to the excitation stage

2362
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
As soon as you kick to the trigger table, here is the fast material

2363
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So after an electron from below kicks up, it stays in a hole

2364
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
As for this hole, the electrons next to it will always go back... keep filling it.

2365
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
So when the electrons are filling, it seems that the hole is moving

2366
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Electronics are filling in, you can see that we are playing that crossball

2367
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
There's a hole here, you fill it in

2368
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
It's not that you can't move

2369
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
move

2370
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
so it seems

2371
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
In fact, the electron is going

2372
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
But the reflection seems to be moving electric

2373
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
As far as the defender's electric is going

2374
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
there is a movement

2375
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You are basically empty above

2376
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So this electron is free to move

2377
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Right, so the electrons are also going

2378
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So this electron is also going

2379
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Electric is also running here

2380
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
OK when will it shine

2381
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
it's easy

2382
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
this is the electron

2383
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
OK Liang Sanbo also pay attention

2384
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
It is this electron that touches this electric

2385
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
For position

2386
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
down it shines

2387
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
can i ask one thing

2388
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
When an electron and an electric

2389
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
if you think of it as a boat

2390
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
OK think of this place as the Pacific Ocean

2391
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
There is a boat in the Pacific

2392
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
sudden lightning strike

2393
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
just after the light

2394
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
lightning strike in half

2395
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
OK, what about the two halves?

2396
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
words wandering in the pacific

2397
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
what is the chance of it overlapping

2398
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
0 impossible things

2399
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
But if you take this Pacific Ocean

2400
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Keep chopping and chopping into seven Lianpeng

2401
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
even cut into smaller smaller smaller

2402
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
If you cut it down to such a small area

2403
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Will this be a reunion?

2404
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
yes so it's that simple

2405
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,760
So we cut this block all the way

2406
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,000
If the way of top down

2407
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,360
What will I do with the e-bin?

2408
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,040
just keep hacking

2409
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,440
cut to small

2410
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,440
as small as the two of them

2411
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,520
also have mutual attraction

2412
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,040
mutual attraction

2413
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,040
This is the so-called wave radius

2414
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,320
We call it the Bohr radius

2415
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,000
just write the hydrogen atom

2416
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,120
In terms of Bohr radius

2417
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,400
just below this radius

2418
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,600
it also mutual

2419
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,760
if you feel each other

2420
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,800
it can overlap

2421
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:26,520
right

2422
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:29,840
Then this varies with your material

2423
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,240
I feel like something is in a long place

2424
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:33,560
You can also learn from each other

2425
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,800
There is PBS

2426
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,840
flow chemical fiber

2427
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,720
that is very long

2428
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,840
it can still know

2429
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,680
basically

2430
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,000
like CWG is ok

2431
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,320
Probably about 15 or 20 nm

2432
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,200
it also knows

2433
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,560
so we chop it chop chop chop

2434
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,440
Cut to 15 nm

2435
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,840
or around 10 nm

2436
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,840
It has the opportunity to overlap the electron and the electric

2437
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,080
If it does not coincide with the previous

2438
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,080
promising

2439
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,200
Suppose there is an electric

2440
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,840
electronic

2441
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,400
Electrons go around like this

2442
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,080
that's not like anything

2443
01:17:59,080 --> 01:17:59,580
very much like

2444
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,600
Aten isn't it? Electrons go around electrics

2445
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,800
Isn't it? OK

2446
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,900
So all the formulas are the same

2447
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,200
That is, when the Size is larger

2448
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,200
Its Gap is smaller

2449
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,200
The smaller the Size, the larger the Gap

2450
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,100
why? because it's the same

2451
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,900
Have you ever learned Particle in a box

2452
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,600
Just tell you about Particle in a box

2453
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,100
When we leave the table now

2454
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,700
The longer the distance, the smaller the Energy gap

2455
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:22,400
Is this the same?

2456
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,600
When you cut bigger, its Energy gap gets smaller

2457
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:30,700
Therefore, the long wavelength and short wavelength of its light are related to its

2458
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,500
What about it? It has something to do with its radius

2459
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,200
OK like this

2460
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,400
Then why does it shine?

2461
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,800
The reason is that we cut it to

2462
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,700
It also knows that it can find itself

2463
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,100
OK it will shine

2464
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,000
I use this simplest explanation

2465
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:43,500
if you want to explain the words in your eyes

2466
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,500
It's okay if it takes two hours, everyone.

2467
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,800
just in this way you know what to say

2468
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,300
It shines because you cut it down to the Bohr radius

2469
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,000
OK, the Boer radius varies with the material

2470
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,700
it just shines

2471
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,700
The size of the emitted light wavelength

2472
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,000
OK the wavelength is shorter when you're younger

2473
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
The larger the OK, the longer the wavelength

2474
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
with this method

2475
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
According to this you know one thing is

2476
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
how do you synthesize it

2477
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
OK

2478
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I just cut it, right?

2479
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
You can also use this method called top down

2480
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
you can use button up

2481
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
chemical synthesis

2482
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It's very simple to let each atom like this

2483
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
keep accumulating, accumulating, accumulating somewhere

2484
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
stop

2485
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
how to stop

2486
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
How do you know its size?

2487
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
We all use wavelengths of light

2488
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
shine down

2489
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
stop it stop it

2490
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
OK this way

2491
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
If you want to stop before, you will soon

2492
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
stop in seconds

2493
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
not now

2494
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
wait till i get on with it

2495
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
minutes now

2496
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
used to be like this

2497
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
So of course ours is easy

2498
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
For example, if you want a CD

2499
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I want to do CDSE

2500
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Whole body of your CD

2501
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Just use a complex

2502
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Let's call this Oligosacid oleic acid

2503
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Just cut it into a complex like this

2504
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Then, the abbreviation is to use a high temperature

2505
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
because we are in high temperature

2506
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
we want high temperature synthesis

2507
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
So use this Oxothexate at high temperature

2508
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
you are ok

2509
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Then SE

2510
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
OK we also want to use complex

2511
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
OK use this complex

2512
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,700
I often talk about TOP, TW is this thing

2513
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,200
is forcefing

2514
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,700
with this method

2515
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,200
so in this way

2516
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,300
this is picasso, this is picasso two

2517
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,300
That is, the whole district is organized in this sauver

2518
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,500
Then what are these picasso these

2519
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:18,100
as its surfactant

2520
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,600
Why surfactant? It's simple

2521
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,200
Do you want to use chemistry to grow

2522
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,400
What is the most stable?

2523
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,600
fast material

2524
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,800
If you don't restrict it, it will definitely become fast material

2525
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,300
How do you limit it? It's simple

2526
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,000
in a template

2527
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:31,900
What is this template?

2528
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:34,200
Yes, surfactants can form enveloping

2529
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,300
Use the bag as a template

2530
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,200
Let it grow this thing, it's that simple

2531
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,800
You can go to probi for the bag

2532
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,300
like a long bag or a

2533
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,100
Generally, except that there are more bags

2534
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:46,700
What does a long bag grow into?

2535
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,600
grow into a wild or rod

2536
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,600
so you grow into a quantum dot

2537
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,500
let's take a look

2538
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,700
So in this way you know

2539
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,300
I'm trying to tell you this

2540
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,600
Then we probably use it like this for a long time

2541
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,000
put this with this

2542
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,400
Cut the two together and add to 300 degrees

2543
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,600
up to 300 degrees and basically

2544
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,200
Of course, this is actually cooking to 300 degrees first

2545
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,800
cast this in

2546
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,200
cast in and what you get

2547
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,300
get this next to

2548
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,400
These are all interfacial agents that can be used as it

2549
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,800
cut it down

2550
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,200
make it only spawn in a sphere or something

2551
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,800
Then stop where you see the light

2552
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,500
It only knows about the size

2553
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,400
For example, 5 nil only ones are about to shine

2554
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,800
all in yellow

2555
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,200
Wait a minute and I'll show you

2556
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,300
so you know what to say

2557
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,000
In fact, they are all grown in this way.

2558
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,700
This is the easiest way ok

2559
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:35,500
It's a pity that the light emitted by such growth is very weak

2560
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,400
what is the reason

2561
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,300
because you also know one thing

2562
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:39,500
when you get smaller and smaller

2563
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,200
How about it

2564
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,800
We call service to volume and it gets bigger and bigger

2565
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,100
What is service to volume

2566
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:46,400
This is the interface

2567
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,400
to process to volume

2568
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,000
In fact, the interface is more and more

2569
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,700
You also know how to learn this

2570
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,000
Learn without ability

2571
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,200
what is the interface

2572
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,800
are all flaws

2573
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,500
interface stuff

2574
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,700
All interfaces are dangling bombs

2575
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,100
Why

2576
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,100
because everything else is fine

2577
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Did you face the air?

2578
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,500
Or face liquid is not connected

2579
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,500
So this place is full of flaws

2580
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,000
If the electron hits up or electric it

2581
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,500
it will be trap

2582
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,500
will be there now

2583
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
It doesn't shine, just change to this

2584
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:16,000
So it doesn't work that way.

2585
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,500
If that doesn't work, what should I do?

2586
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,500
Of course, many people do just use

2587
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,500
The so-called call share method

2588
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:24,500
It's next to it. When it grows to this place, take it out.

2589
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Then go in and grow another layer of ZNS

2590
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,500
The total ZN's precursor and s's precursor are one layer longer

2591
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,000
ok then like this

2592
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
If the side is more enclosed

2593
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
There's no flaws in this place, shine

2594
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
why doesn't it come here from the electron

2595
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,500
because of what in this place

2596
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,000
The so-called varensband of this place

2597
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
跟conduction band

2598
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Just how to translate varensband

2599
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Electrical strap and conductive strap

2600
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
ok, this one is higher than it

2601
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
So electrons won't go out Electric won't go out

2602
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
So it is now here

2603
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,500
it shines in this place

2604
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,000
At this time, the light is very strong

2605
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,500
ok so use this way

2606
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,000
what will you get

2607
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
different size you see

2608
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
This is

2609
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,800
Its radius is 1.7nm 1.9 2.2 2.6 3.0

2610
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,760
Just 30 N Shuang

2611
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,520
Let’s see who it is, the wavelength of its light is getting longer and longer

2612
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,120
From more than 400 to more than 600

2613
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:13,600
It is possible to get the Hongchen Huangli combustion battery

2614
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,960
In total this is done in seconds

2615
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,160
This can be done in about two or three minutes

2616
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,000
Organic health

2617
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:24,920
If you want to make red dust Huang Li combustion battery

2618
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:25,760
you wait slowly

2619
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,640
You have to do different things, the light is so strong

2620
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:29,400
probably several years

2621
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,560
But it does it for you in three minutes

2622
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,320
so you get what you want

2623
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,760
What's more, it's not over yet

2624
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,760
because it is a version without these molecules

2625
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,640
Only FORNONG Only the vibration of biomass

2626
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:47,440
So its full width at half maximum when it is shining is very narrow.

2627
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:48,000
so narrow

2628
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,920
ok let's see

2629
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,000
Of course I'll show you the sex first

2630
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,400
So when I was coming yesterday, I asked my students to say

2631
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,840
Make a batch for me tonight

2632
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,000
So he immediately put together a batch

2633
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,400
mentor this is it

2634
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,160
OK let's see how this goes

2635
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,840
I wrapped it in a plastic bag

2636
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,100
Because it's pretty poisonous

2637
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,720
Basically I don't want to take it out

2638
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:05,760
ok let's see

2639
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:08,600
I just take this light, it's beautiful

2640
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:11,700
did you see

2641
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,400
Have you seen the red dust yellow green blue tissue paper?

2642
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,100
OK, it's really beautiful, that's all

2643
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,700
The student made it for me last night

2644
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,000
look how fast you can make these things

2645
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,300
like this

2646
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,800
OK so you see it's shining every box occipital lobe

2647
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,100
Probably above 0.7 0.6

2648
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:27,900
definitely above

2649
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,100
OK it's that strong

2650
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,100
OK so of course you know one thing

2651
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,600
even blu-ray i'm now

2652
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,600
I know people like Mr. Lin

2653
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,000
They just make a bunch of blue ones

2654
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,500
Molecule of what

2655
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,200
Look, it's Super Blue

2656
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,000
This super strong Blue's words

2657
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,300
Quantaneers is definitely 1

2658
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,000
OK look how strong it is

2659
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,400
I, you already see a little blue here

2660
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,000
OK this doesn't seem to be visible

2661
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,700
No because of course because of being blocked

2662
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,000
This super strong blue light

2663
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:54,600
this is basically

2664
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:55,900
So of course one thing is to say

2665
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,300
you use this way you know what to say

2666
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,400
it can definitely be done

2667
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,600
with this method

2668
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,400
But in this way there is a

2669
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,800
There is only one shortcoming

2670
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,400
you said you made this

2671
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,600
What are you going to develop next?

2672
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,600
I think just one is very simple is to put these two

2673
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:12,600
Cut it off and say to light it in this place

2674
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:14,000
Then this is called TAP1

2675
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,300
You can also change the different put this electron put it

2676
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,200
Move out, look, let me move out for you to see

2677
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,600
you see i can also say

2678
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,300
For a TAP2, these two are stepped

2679
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,500
stepwise you see after stimulating it

2680
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,000
Electronics are here Electricity has come here

2681
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,700
OK so e electric thus in this place

2682
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,400
it becomes short wavelength at 900

2683
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,700
900 NM

2684
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,100
Look, it doesn't matter how you adjust it.

2685
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,300
I can go all the way from here to blue

2686
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,000
It is no problem to transfer to INFARATE

2687
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,800
OK let alone these things

2688
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,600
because it has only the motion of procreation

2689
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,300
OK so it doesn't have what we call

2690
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,300
Energy Gaprow

2691
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,000
OK where are you shining

2692
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,900
You know when it's tuned right it can shine very brightly

2693
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:48,900
I'll see it right away

2694
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,300
But this place still doesn't work

2695
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,700
you see it doesn't work like this why not

2696
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,600
Because the electric on this outer layer

2697
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,900
OK is still flawed on the outside

2698
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:58,100
So outside you can paint a TAP1

2699
01:25:58,600 --> 01:25:59,400
cut it down

2700
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,100
If these two use this to cut it down, it will be very strong

2701
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,100
If you are unlucky, I will show you

2702
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:08,560
You see, if there is only one layer of CDSE, the light shines

2703
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,560
Li Guang is here

2704
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,960
shine here

2705
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,560
Let the light shine here when you are on the second floor

2706
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,560
It's already 900, but it's very weak

2707
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:18,400
I put two layers outside to patch up a layer of ZNS

2708
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,400
After chopping it down, the light is so strong

2709
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,400
This light energy has already reached almost 1 in one ear.

2710
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,600
at 900

2711
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,600
Which one can you put in the organic health can reach 900

2712
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,400
It's light energy, one ear and one ear, it can't be type

2713
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,900
It doesn't matter if the 900 can't see it, use night vision goggles

2714
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,300
Night vision goggles for you

2715
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,700
We use night vision goggles and say it's too strong for the eyes

2716
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,700
OK From night vision goggles it should be super strong

2717
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,200
Just 900 OK basically it's not a problem

2718
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,300
OK good

2719
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,300
Where is the biggest problem with this method

2720
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,740
Why are you using Core Shield?

2721
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:46,240
you have learned one thing

2722
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,700
Yes, if you have learned Welding and Solding today

2723
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,700
Welding and Soldering, right?

2724
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,300
like that you want that for that line

2725
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:58,900
When connecting the wires and connecting the soldering, right?

2726
01:26:58,900 --> 01:26:59,900
if you use that

2727
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
If you use Constant to answer with sweat, you can open it with one poke.

2728
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
It opens with one poke, this is called Solding

2729
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Why because Crystal doesn't match

2730
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Crystal Latest is its golden grid not Match

2731
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Ok, if it’s the same Match, it’s called Wielding

2732
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
We call it worthy of sweating, then it will be very tight

2733
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
these are the problems

2734
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
When you say I'll pack another one

2735
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
If you only wrap one, it will fall off after a while.

2736
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Ok because it Crystal is Mismatch

2737
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
This is the problem, so the current practice is not to do this

2738
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Ok, didn’t I just talk about CDS-11 and cut another ZNS

2739
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Ok don't do it now how do you do it now

2740
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I used to do this, but now I use alloys

2741
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Alloy is just mixing it up, whatever it is, just mixing it up

2742
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Ok why ZNS

2743
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Because we know that ZN CDS-11 will be faster Match

2744
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Then ZN slowly came in Didget, so it will form a box outside

2745
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Then it’s gradual, it’s like quartz and glass can’t be cut, right?

2746
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
you put a Gracier in

2747
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Eleven on one side and glass on the other

2748
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
it can be connected together

2749
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
In the same way, how about using this method?

2750
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It's much better than before

2751
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Actually, I'm sorry I lied to you just now.

2752
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
That's how it was done just now

2753
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
then why do you do this

2754
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
because what's the benefit

2755
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Because it has nothing to do with Size

2756
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
How much Zn is in it matters

2757
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So at this time I can stretch it to 10 minutes

2758
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
to do it for a few seconds is great though

2759
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
But how do you stop for a few seconds

2760
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Do mass production like this and you have problems

2761
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
This way you can make blue

2762
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
This powder I just showed you is a solution

2763
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
OKpowder like this

2764
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
If you don't believe me you can see that we can

2765
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
make this blue make green

2766
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Being popular won’t lie to you, right?

2767
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
It is made, you can see that the amount made is so large

2768
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
make it every time

2769
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
about two grams

2770
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
two grams of something

2771
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Sorry, now a gram is 25,000 yuan

2772
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
so still useful

2773
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Twenty-five thousand yuan is just my cost

2774
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
If you want to go to frame light VG to sell

2775
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Two grams will cost you about 40,000 to 50,000.

2776
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
The most conservative 40,000 to 50,000

2777
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Not only... I don't know how much

2778
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
basically

2779
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Let's take a look

2780
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So its light emission is probably very narrow.

2781
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
General organic dyes emit light

2782
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
It's probably... If it's a green it's probably like this

2783
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
It shines about 1⁄ of its light

2784
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
What's the benefit?

2785
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
is RGB

2786
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
If it is RGB, it can be done without FILTER

2787
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
this is the best part of it

2788
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Its IdeaCase

2789
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Each if 30 Nm

2790
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Not even FILTER

2791
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Not even green light

2792
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
You also know we lose a lot of light

2793
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It's because of the green light film

2794
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
So its Country is so good that it explodes

2795
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Now its Country doesn't work anymore

2796
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
So everyone knows that this is a

2797
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Then you said CDs are poisonous, right?

2798
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
You can also use non-toxic

2799
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
We now use ZNCINH2

2800
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
In this way we can also do anything

2801
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,000
It can be done without any problem in this space.

2802
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Sorry, the biggest problem with this technique is

2803
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Can only do green light, not red

2804
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Why?

2805
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Because this place costs a lot of ZN

2806
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,560
The more words go to the shorter wavelength

2807
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,840
so we can't make red light

2808
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,440
But Liguang we can do well

2809
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,160
there is a problem here

2810
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,560
OK we make it like this

2811
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,480
15.3489 grams can be made at one time

2812
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,800
Wow this is posted

2813
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,840
OK, if this is currently for sale

2814
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,440
Of course you have to sell to others

2815
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:17,400
people can do it right away

2816
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:18,160
so to wrap

2817
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,560
so packaging wait a minute i can talk

2818
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:20,800
you sell this

2819
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,280
No company in Taiwan knows what to do

2820
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,840
OK so how are you going to pack what he's doing

2821
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,320
this is a science

2822
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,240
This is the real knowledge

2823
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:29,360
This is no longer a patent

2824
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,200
why no patents

2825
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,520
20 years of development

2826
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,160
The previous patent has long since expired.

2827
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,360
OK so this patent is a patented method

2828
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,960
Not in the patent how to synthesize

2829
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,760
OK, supposedly this looks a lot like

2830
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,520
What's so strange about the one that looks like a thread?

2831
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,600
Look, turn off the lights and turn on the lights

2832
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,640
this is so beautiful

2833
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:46,440
did you see

2834
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:47,760
this is full force

2835
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:50,040
OK so the answer is it's gold

2836
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:50,440
do not forget

2837
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:51,560
It's more expensive than gold

2838
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:52,200
OK basically

2839
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:52,920
you know what to say

2840
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,520
it's a scary thing

2841
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,200
OK we hope to use 100 grams in the future

2842
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:58,480
A Batch to do

2843
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,040
OK

2844
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,040
this is what we are trying to do now

2845
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,300
because it's hard, really hard because

2846
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:05,040
We are not from a chemical background

2847
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,000
It's super dangerous to watch him do this kind of thing, let me tell you basically

2848
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,840
So of course you will go in the future

2849
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,640
If it’s really commercial, it’s one kilogram

2850
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,160
You need one kilogram for each background, and I will give you a basic explanation

2851
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:17,500
OK, so what can we do with chemistry?

2852
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,840
In fact, our chemistry is doing some

2853
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It's powerful in doing this multiplication

2854
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:22,660
How do you do some chemical multiplication?

2855
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,000
does it work

2856
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:25,400
OK, this is us

2857
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:26,560
we make this thing out

2858
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,160
You want it to have application value

2859
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:29,840
Of course, the application has a value that shines

2860
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,260
As far as the monitor, we'll talk later

2861
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,460
But is there anything else?

2862
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,760
yes, too many

2863
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,060
Let me give you an example, like we are in...

2864
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,260
it's been a long time

2865
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,860
This was eight years ago, OK

2866
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,360
we develop this, you see

2867
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,560
This is the one that shines, OK

2868
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,800
What to use next to it?

2869
01:31:42,940 --> 01:31:45,060
used to adjust these so-called obsessions

2870
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,200
That fan can contain fake, fake ion

2871
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,060
As for the false ion, it cannot carry two packages like this

2872
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,660
It needs to connect two by two, Tang Lunbao

2873
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,460
Why? Because it's a problem with entropy

2874
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,100
I won't go into too much detail, it's a question of randomness

2875
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:57,860
It needs to be connected two by two, Tang Lunbao

2876
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:59,620
So answer first, we can do one thing

2877
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:00,260
look

2878
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,640
Let's use it to detect armor

2879
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,480
It's very simple. Let's make another

2880
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,240
in a minute

2881
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,080
to synthesize a green and a red

2882
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,600
it's so easy no problem

2883
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,320
So we synthesized a green one to do rice filling

2884
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,680
wrap it in this place

2885
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,560
So when armor cuts in

2886
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,200
It may be red and green cut together

2887
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,280
Also follow red with red, also follow green with green

2888
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,960
It doesn't matter, the probability of red and green is 1.2

2889
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,920
So as long as red and green are cut together, there will be energy transfer

2890
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,200
green turns red

2891
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,720
OK we see the green ones disappear and the red ones grow

2892
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,120
is it really like this

2893
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:31,960
OK the answer is yes

2894
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,760
OK look

2895
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,440
So the answer is when red and green

2896
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,120
you know it will grow to

2897
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:39,240
The green one will disappear when the armor is dropped

2898
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,360
OK until halfway it doesn't move why

2899
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,680
Because the others are green green red red it does not move

2900
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:45,640
So this is also saying that the theory is right.

2901
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,280
OK, let me tell you that it was originally this color

2902
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,160
The more red the color becomes

2903
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,760
so you see it's useful

2904
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:52,040
OK basically

2905
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,640
If you don't believe me let's see another

2906
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:55,280
This is what I cooperated with Fang Junping and the others

2907
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:55,760
OK basically

2908
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,120
it was a long time ago

2909
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,720
This was at least eight or nine years ago

2910
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,040
you see we can go

2911
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
After we synthesized this thing

2912
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Teacher Fang and the others synthesized this so-called

2913
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
called

2914
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
This is Gout

2915
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
juta gujami

2916
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
this is very simple

2917
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Guta Gujami is the one with eggs

2918
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
help me the most over there

2919
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
OK because the egg needs to

2920
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
something to find sperm

2921
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
OK, if the sperm and egg are going to combine

2922
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
next to the embryo of your egg

2923
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,000
must have this thing

2924
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
So let's take this as an egg

2925
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
agree again

2926
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Let's take this as an egg

2927
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Take this Guta Gujami

2928
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
use it with a SS linkage

2929
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
then in this place

2930
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
this reverting action

2931
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
become SH

2932
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
cut it

2933
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
then i can say

2934
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
cut with this semiconductor

2935
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
It's all cut with a flow machine

2936
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
OK and G also use streamers

2937
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
ok then why

2938
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Because if the flow machine cuts it

2939
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
about 20 kcal

2940
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
The energy is 20 kcal, this stick

2941
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Flow and G are the most stable

2942
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Flow and G is 41 kcal

2943
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
so why

2944
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
All G's Neoplas use stream cutting

2945
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
OK, that's easy to remember

2946
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
If you want to test

2947
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Flowing G years Flowing G years

2948
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Flow and G are the best OK

2949
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So Liu and G cut is the best

2950
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
basically

2951
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
This stream we use

2952
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
So after chopping it up

2953
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
just treat it as a soft paper

2954
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
so we find gold

2955
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
We use C2 circle

2956
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It's the gold of the sea urchin

2957
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
look

2958
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Cut with sea urchin gold

2959
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Everything is included in this place

2960
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Our NEOPARTY are all cut in this place

2961
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
this place where the spun cut to gold

2962
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I said

2963
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Maybe it has this place

2964
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
very simple

2965
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Let's take that bone off

2966
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,000
We use MANOS

2967
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
MANOS will be cut everywhere

2968
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
You can see that MANOS will be cut everywhere

2969
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So the answer it's really specific

2970
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
then you say this

2971
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Then why we are developing

2972
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
because it's too poisonous

2973
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
CD is too poisonous

2974
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
so cd now

2975
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
No

2976
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
This semiconductor of CD

2977
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
no one is using what

2978
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
The Bio-Medical Impossible

2979
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
The reason is too poisonous

2980
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
OK so now instead

2981
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
The most used one is Materials Science

2982
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
OK that Materials Science

2983
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
everyone knows

2984
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I won't talk about this

2985
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I jump over there are too many

2986
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
OK we see

2987
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
monitor

2988
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Future Trends

2989
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
OK because you can draw this number

2990
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,400
This was announced last week

2991
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:05,100
It's called REC2020

2992
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,700
it's 2020

2993
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:08,800
Specifications for all displays Highest quality

2994
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,800
This is the Color specification

2995
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,100
What about the Color specification?

2996
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,100
Currently it looks like there is only one reachable

2997
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,200
frame root way

2998
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,300
Why? Because it RGB is the best

2999
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:20,200
This is Sony made RGB

3000
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,200
basically speaking

3001
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:22,700
Made it with frame root

3002
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:24,300
How many ways are there to frame the roots?

3003
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:25,800
one is you know

3004
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:29,500
It is probably Sony's type that uses this on both sides.

3005
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,300
Just use Blu to make the green frame root

3006
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,200
White light comes out from the red frame

3007
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,800
The other CM

3008
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,800
The root B volume of the box is to use FIM

3009
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,700
This FIM is the same

3010
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:40,700
green and red

3011
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:42,500
Then the following is with Blu-ray

3012
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,400
because blu ray is the best

3013
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,500
Blue LED is the best

3014
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,300
460

3015
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:48,800
Use 460 to dial 520 and 630

3016
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,300
OK, this is white light

3017
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,500
This approach is OK

3018
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,200
Then there is the Micro chip

3019
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,900
Just put it DD now

3020
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,200
the red and green

3021
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:56,700
D to what?

3022
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:57,800
Micro chip aspect

3023
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,000
That Micro chip is LED to what?

3024
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Blue, ah, what is blue when it shines

3025
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:02,700
is white light

3026
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:04,300
OK, there are these three ways

3027
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,700
That's probably the most

3028
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,700
The biggest trend is probably this

3029
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:08,900
Film does the most

3030
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
OK, so actually we have chosen Film

3031
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,300
doing ok

3032
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:13,000
That

3033
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,600
Kuan Sheng Dao can do it very well

3034
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,600
the hardest part

3035
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,400
How to cut together with Polymer

3036
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,300
become this Film

3037
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:19,500
Oh that's a science

3038
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,300
We spent almost two years

3039
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:22,300
OK everyone, no need to take pictures

3040
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,900
Because of this I just write one

3041
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,900
Because we're going to announce OK basically talk

3042
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,500
So everyone, one thing is very simple

3043
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,600
You see we can use this kind of Film

3044
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,200
make a green and red

3045
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,000
OK green and red OK basically

3046
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,800
Ah, if he doesn't shine

3047
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,800
Then this color OK basically speaks

3048
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:37,700
that's in this place

3049
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,700
We make a Film

3050
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,000
Come on, let's take a look at this Film for you

3051
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,000
This Film is what we made OK

3052
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,400
you see you use blue

3053
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,700
Use blue, this is all blue

3054
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:45,900
look at blu ray

3055
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:47,600
fat is white

3056
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,400
Because it's only green and red

3057
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,000
Ah, adding blue is white

3058
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:52,900
OK turn off the lights is like

3059
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,400
Because this blu-ray is actually

3060
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,800
I spark blue light

3061
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:56,800
but he is white

3062
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:57,600
Ah, if you are unlucky

3063
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,600
I don't want the whole paper

3064
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,600
don't focus

3065
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,440
If the whole paper is illuminated, it will look like this

3066
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:03,440
just white light

3067
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,680
OK, it's white

3068
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,840
So this is its niche

3069
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,200
It can produce a white light

3070
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,680
Send this this display

3071
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,880
Then let you do all the following actions

3072
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,840
OK, it can be done even without filter

3073
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,140
Why? Because each one is

3074
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:19,000
Both are very, very sharp bandwidth

3075
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,080
OK, basically

3076
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,800
What about the bright paper point, and its application in luminescence

3077
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,400
just said passive

3078
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,040
That is, you directly use the blu-ray to pump to get it

3079
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,800
if you want to be active you have to take the initiative

3080
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,400
That is QLED

3081
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,400
Sorry about the LEDs on Quadrant Road

3082
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,200
Quadrant Road's LED so far

3083
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:35,600
Taiwan's development

3084
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,000
that's too far behind

3085
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:38,000
OK, basically

3086
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,200
because i'm doing chemistry

3087
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:41,000
I'm not doing engineering

3088
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
In fact, I have been calling for it for five or six years.

3089
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,200
ok , basically talk

3090
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,900
Or Taiwan has done too little

3091
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,200
That's 18% done recently

3092
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:50,200
OK, I think 18% this

3093
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,600
Including public and educational personnel are very useful

3094
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,800
That's 18% OK, basically

3095
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,200
You just remember 18%

3096
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,400
ok , basically talk

3097
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,200
Then why couldn't it be done before?

3098
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,400
You look good, let me tell you, everyone

3099
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,000
this

3100
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,600
No Fundamental

3101
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,360
you don't want to do anything

3102
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,200
OK, this is developed to be 8 temperature ratio

3103
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,100
on MIT

3104
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:08,300
With this Broadic

3105
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,700
This is in the electrical department

3106
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:10,800
This is the electrical department

3107
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:11,900
this is from the chemistry department

3108
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,400
The whole combination of motor and chemistry

3109
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,600
you have a way

3110
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,300
OK, there is also a physics department

3111
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,500
There is also a physics department here

3112
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:18,500
then why

3113
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,100
Because the reason why it couldn't be done before is because

3114
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,000
we only know now

3115
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
because when you use electron light

3116
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,800
You used a bunch of electronics and electricity to come out

3117
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,200
This electron is too electric

3118
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,400
too many electrons

3119
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,600
too much for a physical benefit

3120
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,600
Called the reverse OJ Process

3121
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,800
is that it will wipe it all off

3122
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,000
Just the opposite OJ

3123
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:37,800
wait a minute i'll talk about this

3124
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,000
Just the opposite OJ Process

3125
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,400
OJ Process Logically speaking it should be

3126
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,200
one becomes two

3127
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:42,400
it is now two become

3128
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,700
Gone

3129
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:45,200
OK so when a thing is

3130
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,400
that now they are smart

3131
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,200
they are here

3132
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,600
smooth it

3133
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:50,700
Flatten two Bank Gap

3134
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:52,200
Let many electrons

3135
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:53,600
you can come here, come here

3136
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,000
The whole thing is Dilocalize

3137
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,500
so it can be accessed from

3138
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,800
1% to 18%

3139
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,000
OK look at this

3140
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,300
This is the political and economic world in 2013

3141
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:03,320
OK

3142
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,120
The current problem is unstable

3143
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:06,920
If the stability is overcome

3144
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:09,980
I'm sorry, we all have been doing it for so long, probably we don't need to do it

3145
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:11,020
basically talk

3146
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,800
Our laboratory is now approximately

3147
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:13,320
we follow

3148
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:15,880
With the cooperation of Ocean University, we can probably make it invisible

3149
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:17,920
OK but not high

3150
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:18,680
but this

3151
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:20,480
This is a question about the Five-Eyed Buddha Realm

3152
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:23,560
if this is right if bangwit30nm

3153
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,080
Mineral energy is one

3154
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:27,400
OK, if the stability is enough, who can compare with him?

3155
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:28,680
You two compare

3156
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:31,760
OK, so this is basically what Taiwan should have developed long ago

3157
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:34,060
It's a pity that none of them came out. The other one is the solar battery.

3158
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,100
OK, the solar battery is basically

3159
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,640
That's already a problem with the solar battery.

3160
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:38,920
because of that

3161
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:40,460
The leanant next to it is too long

3162
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,240
Electricity can't be transmitted

3163
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:48,140
Now use the inorganic method to develop it in Toronto, use the inorganic method, use the short chain or inorganic method

3164
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,960
He can do the same with 8.55%

3165
01:39:51,220 --> 01:39:51,960
Bowendy and

3166
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:53,000
Bobic

3167
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,040
OK you know one thing is

3168
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:58,380
How can this be done without combining electrical physics and chemistry?

3169
01:39:58,380 --> 01:39:59,880
OK so this has to be integrated

3170
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
It just doesn't work if you don't integrate

3171
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Don't shoot birds randomly, it's impossible

3172
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
You don't have this kind of random shooting

3173
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
It's impossible for you to shoot wildly.

3174
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
OK so one thing for everyone and this is to visit Demental

3175
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
You're going to move forward, can you find a way, okay?

3176
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
So let me tell you why this loose to the solar cell is

3177
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
is a one

3178
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Future goals Let me give you a very simple example, you see, this is OJ Process

3179
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Look, a Fortone is punched up, this one has electric

3180
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
OK this is no battery yes this electronics if I think solar

3181
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
You also know that Mr. Lin and the others know each other very well.

3182
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
pair a solar cell

3183
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
OK if your dye is like dye brightening

3184
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,000
You go from 700C light to 300 to 400

3185
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
You inspire 400 and you also get 700

3186
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Yes Excite 500 to 700 you from 500 to 700

3187
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
All the energy in between is wasted.

3188
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Because it's better to let it come down here before going out, right?

3189
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
So but it's so loose that it's not the same as you get excited to this place

3190
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
I think it’s good to stimulate 400, here it’s 400

3191
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Let's say it's 800 here

3192
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
From 400 to this place it can be done with a very simple action

3193
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
that is

3194
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,760
When this place comes down, when this place goes up, OJ process

3195
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,160
this down, this up

3196
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:07,000
You can use this place once resonance

3197
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,280
After coming down, this tiredness will change to two

3198
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,960
That is to say, I stimulate an energy

3199
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,360
But it becomes two electrons on top

3200
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,360
ok, this is called up conversion

3201
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,960
ok, so use this way

3202
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,960
In theory you can reach 66%

3203
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:19,960
basically speaking

3204
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,560
This is where everyone tends to go wrong

3205
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:25,040
ok, basically since that Nucia brought it up

3206
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,360
So far I can't really prove how much

3207
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,040
But now with current technology

3208
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,040
Personally, I think this will definitely break through in the future.

3209
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,200
ok, how to break through

3210
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,600
it's an interesting thought

3211
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:34,600
just tell everyone about this

3212
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:36,600
Okay, I probably won't talk about it

3213
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,800
because talking too much

3214
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,800
In addition, it is like shining

3215
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,800
Sorry, gold can shine too

3216
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,200
You see, the gold that is stepped on quickly does not shine

3217
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:44,880
right

3218
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,800
Then when it is greater than 1.5 nm to 50 nm

3219
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,800
We're called, you all know it's called Surface Plasma Justice

3220
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:53,480
Right, gold has color, everyone knows

3221
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,800
right , but it doesn ' t shine

3222
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,200
But when you are as small as 1.5nm

3223
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,360
what has become, quantize

3224
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,300
Discrete phenomenon

3225
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:02,300
it will glow

3226
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,600
This is what our Sense made

3227
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,100
you see it glows red

3228
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:06,300
In red light in this place

3229
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,800
what shall we do this time

3230
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,100
what is our bread

3231
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:11,700
Packet shift derivative

3232
01:42:11,700 --> 01:42:13,900
OK we wrap gold with shifted derivatives

3233
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:16,000
How do you say that eating is not boring? Use the shift derivative package

3234
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,800
Because we already know that there are 4 SH in the shift derivative

3235
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,300
it definitely has a chance

3236
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,800
This is your Nulling OK

3237
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,000
basically it's small

3238
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
So it can be used as Template

3239
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,500
we wrap it up together you see

3240
01:42:26,500 --> 01:42:27,500
look how useful it is

3241
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,600
Basically you see, using the shift derivative package comes out as

3242
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,300
It 1.2 Neyometer

3243
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:32,700
it shines

3244
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:34,900
Space 1 to 0.1 to 0.3

3245
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,300
It's easy if you're unlucky

3246
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,400
Is there a shift derivative in this?

3247
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,100
Look, we'll just use one

3248
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:43,400
So the N station of Insulin's Digest

3249
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,400
Go chop it down and it won't shine when it comes out

3250
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,900
Insulin

3251
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:49,100
After dropping this Insulin and that Decomposed

3252
01:42:49,100 --> 01:42:50,000
it doesn't shine

3253
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So of course Insulin is on top of that

3254
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,500
We published this in NQ1 in 2011

3255
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,500
OK now it has been stuffed 148 times

3256
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,300
Basically someone must use it

3257
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
because i never tan myself

3258
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So this 148 is posted by others

3259
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So the answer is definitely useful

3260
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
We can use it as image

3261
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Then this image red image

3262
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
the one in the muscle

3263
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
That sale is very useful

3264
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Basically I am now a lot of people like us to

3265
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
So they should also be doing this approach

3266
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
basically speaking

3267
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
especially insulin you know

3268
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Diabetes is America's number one disease

3269
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Why is everyone so fat

3270
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
So the answer is that there is no way

3271
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
I don't talk about anything else

3272
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
like these

3273
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
what do we do some fuseale

3274
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Just now, Vice President Wang, you said

3275
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
i do everything

3276
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
do nothing wrong

3277
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
basically speaking

3278
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
You just make a different size

3279
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
What is the fuseale including this shave dependent doing?

3280
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
In fact, we do a lot of this phenomenon

3281
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
even we can use fine silver alloy

3282
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
toon its prasma band

3283
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:50,000
To do opv, we also do a lot of this

3284
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I won't talk about this

3285
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
That's actually

3286
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
if you give me an hour

3287
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I can put this into perspective

3288
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
but there is no time now

3289
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
We do a lot of business with refugee machinery

3290
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
So just now the student of mine

3291
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
my former students

3292
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Chen Junan told me that he was doing New Long

3293
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Do Stem Cell in doing New Long

3294
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
In fact, we also do a lot of this

3295
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
But we do his Imaging

3296
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
We do a lot of things like Imaging

3297
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
i can basically talk

3298
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
What about the last one?

3299
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Let me tell you one thing is this

3300
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
This is the last one

3301
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
This is a wheat field in England

3302
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
English wheat fields, right?

3303
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
This British wheat field is really good

3304
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
when i see this

3305
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
i just know

3306
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It turns out that the Kangbang I studied is exactly the same

3307
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
basically talk

3308
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Then I'm going this way now

3309
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I'm going to Brain Research now

3310
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Because the answer is that I personally think one thing is

3311
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
our future generations

3312
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
The next generation can already live to be 100 years old

3313
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But what's the point of living a very unhappy life, right?

3314
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
So the answer to one thing is

3315
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Your Brain is the most important

3316
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
i didn't lie to you

3317
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I really think Brain Research

3318
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Basically, we must go in the future

3319
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
because our brains

3320
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
nothing has changed in a thousand years

3321
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
But our knowledge has skyrocketed ten million times

3322
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
this is our biggest problem

3323
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
So how to do Brain Research

3324
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
i just matter

3325
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,460
Then I am researching Slautonium and Milatonian

3326
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,160
this piece

3327
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,240
because it's my specialty

3328
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,600
I just said what kind of specialty is this?

3329
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,600
well in this place

3330
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,000
I just stop at this place

3331
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:08,800
OK

3332
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,000
I just said that

3333
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,600
actually, I

3334
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,800
Because there are very few Ph.D.

3335
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:12,900
Look at the doctoral class in recent years

3336
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,200
Only these few people in five years

3337
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,000
So I'm all on my post-out

3338
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,900
OK all my money Sug in my post-out

3339
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:19,100
basically talk

3340
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:20,300
OK that's about it

3341
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,200
thank you all

3342
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:28,700
clap your hands

3343
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,700
Hope you all have one

3344
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:33,000
still enjoy

3345
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
enjoy beauty

3346
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,900
good i think

3347
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,700
Would you like to have a drink first?

3348
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:39,500
I still have a lot of experience

3349
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,700
You see how Energetic he is

3350
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:45,900
ok is there any problem

3351
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:46,400
for this I

3352
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,400
wait a minute my wife tell me

3353
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,100
you say

3354
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:49,200
every time you speak

3355
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,600
like a movie star

3356
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:52,000
But you come home a worm

3357
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:52,500
sure so

3358
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,700
I'm sure

3359
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:56,300
thank you for your speech

3360
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:58,700
I want to ask you about the first half

3361
01:45:58,700 --> 01:45:59,500
because of my

3362
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Kaohsiung gas explosion incident

3363
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,000
because it has that explosive

3364
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Later I went to refer to some chemistry

3365
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Seems like it could also be done in this optomechanical way

3366
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,000
To see if there is chemistry that try

3367
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Or that try to get into the ingredients of these explosives

3368
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I'll ask for advice

3369
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Why like this way

3370
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:29,000
In fact, when they were dealing with incidents similar to those in Kaohsiung

3371
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It does not detect whether there are chemical components of violent substances

3372
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
actually i tell you

3373
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,000
If you want to speak from a spectroscopic point of view

3374
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
if specific few

3375
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
For example, if you measure IR vibration spectrum or Lyman spectrum

3376
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
These things if you want specific

3377
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
specific few

3378
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
In fact, these can be used in the analysis of data

3379
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
can do not a problem

3380
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
this can definitely be done

3381
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So one thing for everyone is to say

3382
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
We are actually from Taiwan...

3383
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,440
His advance is measured after a plan

3384
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,520
What is that data for?

3385
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:06,520
That's where we're not very advanced

3386
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:07,680
why i give an example

3387
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,280
like our LCMAS

3388
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,280
Incredible, including the chemistry department

3389
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,480
The opera you typed out will tell you

3390
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:15,480
I don't know, I don't know what

3391
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:18,480
Our data bank is completely inadequate

3392
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:20,480
Now students and people know one thing

3393
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,480
What are you going to screen for?

3394
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:24,480
Look at that Half or MIT

3395
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,480
that data bank

3396
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,480
how many people are going to do what

3397
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:30,480
How big is the data bank

3398
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,480
The accumulation of how much money and the accumulation of people

3399
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,480
We never do software stuff

3400
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,480
I can tell you about the question you asked

3401
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,480
In terms of explosives, data bank

3402
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,480
absolutely doable

3403
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,480
It's a pity we don't do this kind of thing

3404
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,480
We have instruments coming out and don't know what

3405
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,480
this is our biggest problem

3406
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,480
OK

3407
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,480
Thanks

3408
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:05,000
What is the problem

3409
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
The crazy question is okay

3410
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
crazy question

3411
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I'm always full of crazy ideas

3412
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I didn't lie to you

3413
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
right

3414
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
but crazy idea

3415
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
one out of ten is enough

3416
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
it's obvious

3417
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
A person's life

3418
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
you have to go crazy

3419
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
somehow

3420
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Is it already

3421
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
the light therapy device

3422
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
under that of Taiwan

3423
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
in treatment

3424
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Did you say light therapy?

3425
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Buddha as much as that Thorpe

3426
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Is this most likely skin cancer?

3427
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
What about social traps?

3428
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
OK, this is probably the most light therapy

3429
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
submerged

3430
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Because of the light

3431
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
sorry for something

3432
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
biggest problem with light

3433
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
high energy of light

3434
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I say visible light

3435
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
visible light to that

3436
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
when in infrared

3437
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,000
energy is still too high

3438
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
So generally speaking in terms of infrared

3439
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Can penetrate at most

3440
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
about 0.6 cm

3441
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
already amazing

3442
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,300
so here's the problem

3443
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:03,020
longer wavelength

3444
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,660
It should be deeper

3445
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:05,760
OK basically

3446
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,400
But it doesn't shine, basically

3447
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,560
So you know what MRI like we come out

3448
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:10,660
that long wavelength

3449
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:12,160
it can penetrate this no problem

3450
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,560
But the shorter words

3451
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,900
It's the problem here

3452
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,360
so light therapy

3453
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,400
Sorry to tell you one thing is to say

3454
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:20,800
You're probably going to do a dive.

3455
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,860
OK that's all except for you to have the surgery

3456
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:24,260
I'll do light therapy later

3457
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:25,860
Otherwise it is Target Oriented

3458
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,120
So Target is

3459
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:28,300
is the target

3460
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,020
OK target

3461
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:30,620
And the target has no light

3462
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,320
No, they use monooxygen now.

3463
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:33,620
monoxide, right?

3464
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:35,420
So you target after that place

3465
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:37,720
you can be like we actually are

3466
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,420
i didn't talk

3467
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:39,520
you can

3468
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,220
You can take that and we call it Endopoxide

3469
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:43,420
OK it can

3470
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:45,020
It can be released into single oxygen

3471
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:46,020
That is also possible

3472
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,820
It can automatically do that without lighting

3473
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:48,620
but you want a target

3474
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:49,420
you don't have a target

3475
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,920
Because everything kills the impossible

3476
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,820
OK

3477
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:53,220
any left

3478
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:57,820
No, we thank Professor Zhou

3479
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:59,420
ok thank you thank you thank you all

3480
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Thank you.

3481
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Thank you.

3482
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:02,000
