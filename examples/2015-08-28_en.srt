1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,240
The Aware Zhao said he first visited there

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Academia Sinica's August Knowledge Feast Lecture Begins

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,240
We ask Vice President Chen Jianren to host for us

00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,240
Our protagonist today is Academician Zhang Meihui

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And then gentlemen and ladies

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And my classmates, my friends

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Goodnight everybody

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you all for participating in today's feast of knowledge

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What about this event today?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I hosted the most satisfying time for everyone

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you all for coming here

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We have two hundred people registered

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
When I host a night, there are probably 150 to 160 people.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So today is Professor Zhang Meihui really has a lot of charm

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Professor Zhang Meihui is now a special chair professor of the small department of the National Taiwan University School of Medicine

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He is also an academician of our Academia Sinica

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There are not many women among academicians of Academia Sinica

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Especially life sciences are not many

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Everyone in the medical field is more familiar with

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Academician Peng Wang Jiakang

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,300
That is Academician Zhang Meihui

27
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,300
Therefore, academician Zhang Meihui and Peng Wangjia looked at the two academicians

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,500
They are all Taiwan's outstanding travel experts

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,300
Then every time they give out the award for outstanding traveler

30
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,000
Wow, many Beiyun girls and Zhongshan Linggao children will go to take pictures with him

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The reason is because they also hope that they can be a good scientist one day

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Then human health and well-being can be improved

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,100
Professor Zhang Meihui is such a person who is very kind to patients.

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,300
academic research is well done

35
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Moreover, the field of dedication to mankind is quite large.

36
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,700
Then he graduated from the Department of Medicine, National Taiwan University School of Medicine

37
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Physician who once went to the US UCLA Single Pediatric Changwei Hepatobiliary Nutrition for training

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,900
Then he has published quite a lot of papers in the past

39
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,100
he is a pediatrician

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,300
So everyone focuses on childhood diseases

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,400
Especially research on hepatitis and liver cancer

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,100
what has he posted so far

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
More than 400 papers

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,300
These papers were published in the well-known

45
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,140
Journal of Forestry Medicine

46
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,440
like the sunningland journal of medicine

47
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Journal of the American Medical Association

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,280
Or journals of small subjects, etc.

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,280
is a fairly well-known journal

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,680
And it has been cited quite a lot

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,480
everyone can see

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,980
Its research skills are quite profound

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,360
In addition to research on hepatitis and liver cancer

54
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,160
In addition, it also created the world's first

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,860
Screening System for Biliary Shelter Syndrome

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,660
Then this system helps to improve

57
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,960
Early diagnosis of the disease

58
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,300
Then also prolong the survival rate

59
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,200
So the care of the sick

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,440
Provides many good benefits

61
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,040
it's not easy

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,880
Professor Zhang also served as the

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
many important positions

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,580
Including the director of the small department of the medical school and the hospital

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,800

President of Taiwan Liver Warfare Research Society

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm just a member and he's the president

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Then the director of the Infection Center at National Taiwan University Hospital

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And he was also selected as a luxury university

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
With a visiting scholar at the National Institutes of Health in the United States

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Served in many important positions in medical societies

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can’t do it one by one. Everyone has this information in hand.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Almost all domestic academic awards

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Academician Zhang got everything

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000

There is also a classic award called ISI Highly Cited Papers

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
this is an international award

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Refers to the number of times this paper has been cited by all journals of ISI

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
that's not easy

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Few people in the world can get the ISI paper citation award

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He also received a well-known scientist from the International Society of the Liver

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000

and awards from the Canadian Liver Society, etc.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Therefore, Professor Zhang Wenhui is in

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
liver

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Stomach, liver and gallbladder

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and this aspect of addiction therapy

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
have profound attainments

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then we are honored to have him here today

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
give us a speech

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
saw so many people attending

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I believe everyone will look forward to it

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
From Professor Zhang's research

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
gain more knowledge

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Professor Zhang he published in a new article

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A paper in a medical journal

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It is about children's education and vaccination

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
vaccination against hepatitis b

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
prevent liver cancer

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is the first paper in the world that says

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Anti-acupuncture can prevent cancer

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
this super god

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
amazing research

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And this study not only

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Pediatric liver cancer in Taiwan

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Even after he reaches adulthood

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The incidence rate just now is still decreasing

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Such a classic study

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
after publication

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
the whole world is watching

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
any other cancer

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Vaccines can also be used to prevent

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Later, humans tried their best not to understand

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Discovery accuses police of being caused by Human Spikevirus

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So the vaccine for the main human spike virus was developed.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So now many girls

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Vaccine against endemic virus

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to prevent accusations against the police

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The idea of ​​vaccines was first put forward

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Can prevent cancer

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
such an important discovery

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Zhang Yuanshi

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the research he did

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in international journals

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Has been cited more than 1000 times

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There are not many papers with more than 1000 times

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
More than 1000 papers in Taiwan

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
presumably in medicine

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
My own statistics probably won't exceed 10 slices

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,320
Professor Zhang Yunhui is one of them

136
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,640
He is also highly regarded internationally

137
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,700
So today we, Manor Circle have the honor

138
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,540
You can invite Professor Zhang to give us a speech

139
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,360
I won't say much, I will leave the time to Professor Zhang

140
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,720
After his speech, he will have some questions and answers with you.

141
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,300
Then shall we welcome warmly with applause?

142
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,580
this great wish

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,640
Thank you very much to that Vice President Chen for such a good introduction.

144
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,160
very dare not be

145
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,520
I also feel very honored to have the opportunity to be here today.

146
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,340
have some discussion with you

147
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,180
Seniors here

148
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,960
and everyone

149
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,520
Ladies and gentlemen, students

150
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,600
I also see very young

151
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,620
kid

152
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,960
I am very happy to have this opportunity to share with you

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,820
Let's exchange knowledge on this

154
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,620
this we hope to have some discussion

155
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,820
I am looking forward to it, that is to say, I hope today's speech can be

156
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,840
This is an opportunity to exchange ideas with you

157
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,440
I think my topic today starts from this

158
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,500
Anti-Cancer Vaccines Begin

159
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,320
Let's take a look at this first

160
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,640
I roughly sorted out our today's content

161
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,180
Probably cancer

162
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,340
and infection and cancer

163
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,580
Hepatitis B virus infection and liver cancer

164
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,080
and cancer control

165
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,540
cancer prevention

166
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,180
Hepatitis B Vaccine and Liver Cancer Prevention

167
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,280
besides

168
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,140
Future Prospects for Cancer Vaccines

169
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,040
roughly today's

170
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
The content should be in this place again

171
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
So let's look at this first

172
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,640
current status of cancer

173
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,280
Then we start from the World Health Organization

174
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,980
It's reported in the latest this one

175
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,080
The 2014 world is still reporting

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,220
It seems that cancers around the world have actually been on the rise

177
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,900
We all know that cancer is the number one cause of death in the world

178
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:15,300
In 2012, the statistics on the number of new cancers in the world increased again

179
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,060
Probably increased to about 14 million people every year

180
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:23,900
In addition to the incidence rate, another very important factor is the mortality rate

181
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,200
Its death rate also increased to around 13 million

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
so a very high number

183
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,900
Here's a look at the world's most common causes of cancer death in 2012

184
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,000
No. 1 is lung cancer

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,400
It accounted for 19.4%, close to 20% of all deaths

186
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,600
The second place is today's theme is liver cancer

187
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,400
I'll spend more time talking about liver cancer later

188
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,700
This is our national disease

189
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,600
The third one is gastric cancer, before the whole world sees

190
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,400
The third place is stomach cancer

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,760
What I want to say is to show you the situation in Taiwan.

192
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,680
The words in Taiwan are very similar to those in the world

193
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,060
No. 1 is lung cancer

194
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,300
The second place is liver cancer

195
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,680
very similar to the world

196
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,980
In the past, our liver cancer was often the number one

197
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,280
Now lung cancer is number one

198
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,780
The third place is the section chief and the chief cancer

199
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,220
The fourth woman's word is breast cancer

200
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,840
That man has oral cancer

201
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,500
That fifth place is female is stomach cancer

202
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
Esophageal cancer in men

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,400
Sixth woman with stomach cancer

204
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,740
That man has stomach cancer

205
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,500
The seventh place is uterine well cancer

206
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,260
and male anterior carcinoma

207
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,620
So this place looks like it's just been discovered

208
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,500
this is the cause of death

209
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,420
Of course there are some diseases like saying

210
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,820
it's easier to treat

211
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,960
The cause of its death may be

212
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,580
Not so many people died

213
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,660
But it happens more often

214
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,100
Then let's take a look at the situation in the world

215
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,820
hepatocellular carcinoma

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The status of this liver cancer

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,840
In what area are there more

218
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
This picture looks like a boy on the left

219
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,640
Then the girl on the right

220
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,680
We can see that what is red is green

221
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,040
then blue is mortality

222
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,440
It seems that neither incidence nor mortality

223
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,520
either red or blue

224
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,400
Both East Asia and Southeast Asia

225
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,720
In terms of liver cancer, it is the most

226
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,360
So this is the disease in our own area

227
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
Liver cancer is the disease of our place

228
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
At the same time we can see that

229
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,160
relatively poorly developed places

230
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,200
The economy is not so good

231
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,400
Its incidence of liver cancer is higher in both men and women

232
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,080
So well-developed countries like this place

233
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,800
not so much

234
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,640
So liver cancer is also a

235
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,560
less well-developed countries

236
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,400
It is more prone to these cancers

237
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,880
shown in this place

238
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,920
This building core water shows

239
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,080
Worldwide average

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
is the IQ of the world

241
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,000
And we are located in East Asia

242
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,700
So let's talk about infection and cancer

243
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,500
this is our focus today

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,500
Of course, it can be seen from the evidence all over the world that

245
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Cancer-causing risk factors

246
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,000
It is often mentioned in newspapers and media that many, many things

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,500
Carcinogens of various cancers

248
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,000
Some of these factors are likely to be

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,500
There's some really, really good evidence that

250
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,500
These have really been proven to be true by various studies

251
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,000
cancer risk factors

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Then this place lists four

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,500
the first is smoking

254
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,000
The second is infection

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,500
The third is radiation

256
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
The fourth is the immune matching agent

257
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,000
These four are very clear

258
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There is already ample evidence that

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,500
It really has a very, very close relationship with cancer

260
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,000
like smoking

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
it's about smoking

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
About 1.5 million people die from this cancer every year in the world

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So smoking is really best not to smoke

264
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Smoking is really closely related to this cancer

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And there is very good evidence that

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The second is infection

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
this is our topic today

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Infecting him with his related death toll in developing countries

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
accounted for 22% of their deaths

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
22% of cancer deaths

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In developed countries it is about 6%

272
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
about 6%

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So infections are more severe in developing countries

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
is a very, very important cause of cancer

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's take a look at the famous ones here.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Relationship Between Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Liver Cancer

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Globally, approximately every year, the number of deaths caused by this hepatitis B virus may be

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
like cancer or related cirrhosis

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
About 340,000 people each year

280
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,500
HPV Infection and Uterine Carcinoma

281
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
About 250,000 people a year

282
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,000
died for this reason

283
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So the numbers are very large

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Of course, the rest is between radiation and immunity.

285
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,500
This is all related to the occurrence of cancer.

286
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,000
Then I will introduce to you

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Which infections can cause cancer?

288
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,500
We have to be very careful and pay attention to prevent these infections

289
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,000
Because it is some vitamins that cause cancer

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The first thing I want to introduce to you is the virus

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone is familiar with this virus

292
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
It is the relationship between rhinohepatitis virus and liver cancer

293
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
This may be in the newspapers and media

294
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,000
or in the textbook

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You might see something like this

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The other is uterine cancer

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
HPV

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is also the message that everyone often sees in this regard.

299
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Maybe you have heard

300
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
rhinohepatitis virus

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
things that can cause liver cancer

302
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Maybe everyone has heard of such a thing

303
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Less familiar ones might be like Epstein-Barr virus

304
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Epstein-Barr virus and this 08 hyperplasia

305
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Or 08 cancer and BNI

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Historically there have been such reports

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It has been confirmed that between the two of them

308
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
have a very close relationship

309
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Another one that you may not be familiar with is

310
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Human T cells are 08 virus

311
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
T cell leukemia

312
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If this is the case, it may be mentioned later.

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For example, in Japan, there are more diseases like this

314
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Another limb-throwing virus may be familiar to everyone

315
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Limb throwing virus because of its very, very many types

316
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
can cause many diseases

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Type VIII of which has recently been discovered

318
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It has something to do with Kaposi meat flow

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Kaposi meatloaf is a cancer

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The last one is probably the least familiar to everyone.

321
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This one called Mercose Cell

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,440
Multiflux virus and Merkel cell carcinoma

323
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,900
this is very new

324
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,560
Everyone is very unfamiliar

325
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,520
It is rarely mentioned in newspapers and magazines

326
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,160
This very new virus and this very new cancer

327
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,560
This is relatively rare

328
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,200
In fact, except for the virus

329
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,960
Another very famous

330
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,320
everyone is very familiar

331
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,400
It's the pyloric spiral

332
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,400
Many people probably have this spiral feeling

333
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,560
Because his incidence rate is very high

334
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,960
Your own family members may also have a pyloric spiral infection

335
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,160
This bacterium has been recognized by the World Health Organization

336
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,520
is closely related to gastric cancer

337
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,960
parasite aspect

338
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,600
In fact, the history has been very long

339
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
I think it should be my student days

340
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,680
That's what the teacher taught

341
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
Learn about worm diseases and bladder cancer

342
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,360
and Chinese liver lizard and bladder cancer

343
00:16:59,360 --> 00:16:59,920
these two

344
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,960
These two family planning insects are actually very famous

345
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,920
closely related to this cancer

346
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,920
So if we want to deal with a disease,

347
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,000
We must first understand why it is

348
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,960
so that we have a way to overcome it

349
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,200
So is cancer

350
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,560
We need to understand exactly how cancer occurs

351
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,200
For example, we know that this source of infection

352
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,920
Then I'm going to avoid getting this infection

353
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,280
Then I won't get this infection

354
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,000
Infection-related cancers

355
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,320
Let's use liver cancer and hepatitis B virus as an example

356
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,560
Let's take a look at this hepatitis B virus first.

357
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,160
This time a very small virus

358
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,000
It's only 3.2KB that's 3200 clips

359
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,360
So it's a very, very small virus

360
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,040
Let's look at the place in the middle

361
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,800
There are two big black circles in the middle

362
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,720
The two big black circles mean

363
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,960
tell us it's a

364
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,920
Double bone DNA virus

365
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,120
DNA virus

366
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Nucleic acid translated into English is DNA

367
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Everyone is very familiar with the thing called DNA.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
it's this its virus

369
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Because some viruses are RNA viruses

370
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Some are DNA viruses

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The DNA virus is the deoxynucleic acid virus.

372
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Then you can see that the circle is incomplete.

373
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's just this place that's missing a piece

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So let's say that the hepatitis B virus

375
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Its genes are not quite this

376
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
DNA virus

377
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
A tiny virus is very delicate

378
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
because it uses such a small gene

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
can make many proteins

380
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
one of the most important

381
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I want to introduce you to this place

382
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
S antigen

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The protein it makes is the surface antigen

384
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
maybe some

385
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Some friends have heard of the hepatitis B surface antigen

386
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
that means it has a coat

387
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
hepatitis b virus it wears a coat

388
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
like we wear a coat

389
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
it also wears a coat

390
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Then his coat is called hepatic facet antigen B.

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Then why mention him in particular?

392
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Because it's him who waits for the vaccine

393
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He is the one who uses his outer coat

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Make this protein and make this vaccine

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
why

396
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
because if you can

397
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If the body can produce antibodies against this protein

398
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
then he is protected

399
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Although he got into us

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But our human body overcomes him

401
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Then after the antibodies

402
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I won't be infected by this virus again

403
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
infected

404
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So this antigen

405
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
This protein is very important

406
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Then we'll mention that

407
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
How do some scholars discover

408
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to something like this

409
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But of course before making vaccines

410
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
will have a lot

411
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So doing research is very important

412
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Because some scholars go to study

413
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It turns out that if the human body has this

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Antibodies to Surface Antigens

415
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
then he can recover

416
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
he can be protective

417
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Another one I want to introduce to you

418
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
inhibitory antigen

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Also smart. He made a medical antigen.

420
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,600
Then this medical antigen is from this called

421
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,400
This place is called the core gene region

422
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,800
The blue one is called the pre-core gene region

423
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,400
Then the medical antigen is made from the pre-core gene region

424
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,800
make one we learn

425
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,000
This medical antigen can be detected in the serum of our patients

426
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,600
Then this medical antigen can be tested

427
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,200
what does it mean if it is positive

428
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
It means that this person has a high viral load

429
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
So our doctor went to draw the patient's blood

430
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,000
When we see that other doctors are positive for antigens, we will say

431
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then you have a lot of viruses

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,500
you are highly contagious

433
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,600
It's easy to get infected if your blood comes out

434
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,200
If the mother is positive for medical antigen

435
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,900
Then this mother can easily pass it on to his next generation

436
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,300
mother-to-child transmission

437
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,200
This is what we will mention later

438
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Then of course there is another one with a structure very similar to his

439
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,100
core antigen

440
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
Then he

441
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,100
There is also an X resistance

442
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,100
protein of X

443
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,400
It is closely related to the occurrence of cancer

444
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
In addition, he did an aggregation

445
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This polymerase is actually its replicating enzyme

446
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
it can use this enzyme to replicate it

447
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then let it continue to produce its offspring

448
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Its polymerase is similar to the reverse enzyme of HIV

449
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
very very similar

450
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So it can produce many, many small viruses

451
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Then it infects the cells next to it and infects others

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So if we look at this cartoon

453
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Pretend it's just the hepatitis B virus

454
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If the cells covered by this circle are liver cells

455
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's the virus that invaded the liver cells

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Because the favorite place for hepatitis B virus to live is the liver cells

457
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It enters our liver cells

458
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
then it drags off its coat

459
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
into the river

460
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And then it's this incomplete DNA

461
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Double bone's DNA can be filled by it

462
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
becomes a complete circular double bone

463
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The status of intact DNA

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
called CCCDNA

465
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,240
Then it goes back to make some

466
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,160
This ribonucleic acid is made into mRNA

467
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,560
Then it makes protein on the one hand

468
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,640
it can do a lot of those proteins just mentioned

469
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,840
It can also be reversed into

470
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,840
because its replicase is an retrointrogenase

471
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
can turn RNA into DNA

472
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,680
And then it makes a lot of DNA

473
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
and use the egg whites it just made

474
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,920
Wrap Its Own DNA

475
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
then wrap it up

476
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
secreted from the cell

477
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Then go outside the cell

478
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Then run to the stem cells next door

479
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
to infect other more more

480
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,700
own stem cells

481
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,200
even from the blood circulation

482
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
and then infect others

483
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,700
Or infect others from bodily fluids

484
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,200
That's how it's contagious

485
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,200
So if we check patients in the hospital

486
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,700
if check it out it has several marks

487
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
like surface antigen positive

488
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
That is, if HBSAG is positive

489
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,840
That means the person has been infected with the hepatitis B virus

490
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,200
Because he made this antigen out

491
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,800
Then if the antigen has been maintained for more than six months

492
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Let's just say you got chronic hepatitis B infection

493
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,960
become chronic

494
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,700
he can last more than six months

495
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,300
Then if the person is lucky after a while

496
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,660
He checks he has antibodies

497
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,500
Then the surface antibody disappears

498
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,800
then we say congratulations

499
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,300
You have actually become an acute infection

500
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,600
Then you have recovered

501
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,260
Having antibodies means that you have been infected

502
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,500
but has recovered

503
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,400
become a condition without chronic infection

504
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,460
or he may not have been infected

505
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
But he was vaccinated against hepatitis B

506
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,000
like many young people

507
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,200
Friends have been vaccinated against hepatitis B

508
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,460
Played under the age of thirty

509
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,560
then he will

510
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,900
protective antibodies

511
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Vaccinations can also produce this

512
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,560
The other is that if it is detected in the blood

513
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,100
Hepatitis B surface antigen positive

514
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,860
and antigen positive

515
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
then we are in trouble

516
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Then your viral load may be quite high.

517
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
because we just mentioned

518
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,460
This medical antigen means that the virus replication is very strong

519
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,440
many viruses mean

520
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,500
So the detection in serum

521
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,600
In fact, the doctor will know your condition after such an examination.

522
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
Not only are you a carrier

523
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
are you infected

524
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,240
And your viral load is high or low

525
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,920
Then another doctor can test it for you.

526
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,460
How much DNA is in hepatitis B

527
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,600
Then he can quantify

528
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,520
How many viruses are there in each CC of blood

529
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,260
That is also how many IU viruses

530
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,120
then you can know

531
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,300
Do you already have this replicating virus in your blood?

532
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,200
That means a lot of viruses

533
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,120
The other one is called the core antibody

534
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,000
Just now we mentioned the core antigen

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,920
The core antigen is undetectable in the blood

536
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,200
However, it can detect antibodies

537
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
yes representative said

538
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,320
if we were infected

539
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,860
If you have been infected in the past or are currently infected

540
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,020
will have this core antibody

541
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,080
can be detected in blood

542
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,600
compared to other countries in the world

543
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,800
Taiwan is considered to be a very prone to hepatitis B

544
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,900
and hepatocellular carcinoma

545
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,400
It-related liver cancer predilection

546
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,300
Currently in Taiwan if the person over the age of 30

547
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,800
have not been vaccinated against hepatitis B

548
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,400
Words from generations that were not beaten in infancy

549
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,100
It can almost be said that 1/1 to 1/1 of the people

550
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,400
has a considerable ratio

551
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,100
Both have chronic hepatitis B virus

552
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,000
that it lasts more than six months

553
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
this has quite a portion

554
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,100
become hepatocellular carcinoma

555
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,900
or cirrhosis of the liver

556
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,600
so these people

557
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,500
We all want him to follow up every six months

558
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,900
One change early to find out whether he has these diseases

559
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,100
Liver cancer occurs more in men than women

560
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,600
Approximately 40 to 60 years of age

561
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,800
It can be regarded as his peak period

562
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,900
About 60% to 80% of the liver cells are in Taiwan

563
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,500
It is related to hepatitis B

564
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,700
chronic hepatitis B virus

565
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,260
related

566
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,600
That's very special compared to other countries in the world

567
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,140
because I'm a pediatrician

568
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,180
i see my patient

569
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,220
How come it seems that there are many liver cancers?

570
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,020
Liver cancer and nose type liver cancer

571
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,280
of course

572
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,360
We will want to do research with him on this

573
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,900
What the hell are these kids

574
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,180
their liver cancer

575
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,740
Is it related to nasal HCC virus?

576
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,820
So when I went to test my patient, I found out that

577
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,620
Wow their nasal HCC virus

578
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,180
The surface anti-inflammatory positive rate is as high as

579
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,720
almost to 100%

580
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,020
So to show our children their

581
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,780
What about liver cancer?

582
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,860
They are all related to nasal HCC virus

583
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,680
That percentage is higher than that of adults

584
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,960
adults probably

585
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,420
60 to 80% because adults also have a

586
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,060
Suction type liver cancer can cause liver cancer

587
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,860
What about our children who hardly see

588
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,180
Suction-type liver cancer causes this condition of liver cancer

589
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,460
almost always with this

590
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,220
HCC

591
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,760
is related

592
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,520
so

593
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,540
we feel this

594
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,860
is a very special thing

595
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,960
To explore how the hepatitis B virus is transmitted

596
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
how did you get it

597
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,040
Why are there so many people in Taiwan

598
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,160
with hepatitis B virus infection

599
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,520
The most important thing is actually mother-to-child transmission

600
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,040
The generation before vaccination

601
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,760
What about those over the age of 30?

602
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,560
Their contagion is mainly half or half

603
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,680
About 50% 60%

604
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,640
In fact, it was passed down to him from his mother.

605
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,240
Then this mother came from grandma again

606
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,960
grandma may be from real grandma again

607
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
Such generations from ancient times

608
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
it's been like this

609
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,080
Passed down from generation to generation

610
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,200
Of course, another very important thing is horizontal infection.

611
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,160
horizontally contagious words

612
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,960
That's what we say from contact with bodily fluids or blood

613
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,000
got it

614
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,360
For example, if it is a sexual act

615
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,080
or contact with dirty needles

616
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,360
or anything that penetrates the skin

617
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
including tattoo removal

618
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,080
prick with something unclean

619
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,680
Or is there something related to this

620
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,520
words of intrusive behavior

621
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,040
At once

622
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,800
so-called horizontal contagion

623
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,520
before there was no screening protocol

624
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,560
Of course, blood transfusion is also a very important way

625
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,240
We especially want to mention mother-to-child transmission today

626
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,400
It's because of mother-to-child transmission in the pre-vaccination generation

627
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,080
About fifty to sixty percent or half

628
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,560
But today we are under the age of 30

629
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,120
Have been vaccinated

630
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,400
people who still get beetle liver cancer

631
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,440
Then it accounts for more than 90%

632
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,840
So mother-to-child transmission is very important

633
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,840
Python virus which can be transmitted from the mother

634
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,720
at the moment of production or before and after production

635
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,920
Because the uterus says Xueyi can cross the placenta

636
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,920
that ran into the vile body

637
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,800
So the newborn may be infected by his mother

638
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,200
or possibly in utero

639
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,440
late in pregnancy

640
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,600
Because of the uterus and so on

641
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,960
This may result in mother-to-child transmission

642
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,760
And we look from our data

643
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
These mother-to-child transmission children seem to be more likely to get chronic liver disease or liver cancer later

644
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
When it comes to this, we must mention this Professor Bisley, who I respect very much

645
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Professor Beasley came to Taiwan from the University of Washington in Seattle

646
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
He set up a research laboratory in Taiwan to study the hepatitis B and liver cancer.

647
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He knew that people in Taiwan were suffering from this disease

648
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So Professor Bisley has been here since 1972 when he was in 1968

649
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Do some research on equine medicine and then go back to the US

650
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But he thinks Taiwan does have a lot of liver diseases

651
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So he was especially in the middle of the 15 or 6 years from 1972 to 1987

652
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Made a very, very great contribution to Taiwan

653
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
He found out that if the mother has hepatitis B and E anti-inflammatory positive

654
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
E anti-inflammatory is a person who proves that there is a very high virus

655
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,740
If there is such a situation

656
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,340
Then he could infect his children

657
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
That is, we people from Taiwan

658
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,740
This condition has been passed down from generation to generation

659
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,540
The continuation has actually been very, very long

660
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,940
he on this matter

661
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,540
He has very in-depth research

662
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,740
Then he and this Dr. Stevens

663
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,240
Their joint research found that

664
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,540
If a pregnant woman tests out

665
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,340
He was positive for surface antigen and medical antigen

666
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,540
We call him double positive

667
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,280
The condition of being double positive for both antigens

668
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,080
The child born to the mother

669
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
85% to 90%

670
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,280
become a chronic infection

671
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,980
because other possible infections

672
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,780
become acute and recover

673
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,340
But these kids are very unfortunate

674
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,640
they become a chronic

675
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,280
then become a chronic infection almost for life

676
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,940
Even the phenomenon of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer

677
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,480
This is also a very important discovery of his

678
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,580
because in the future he will

679
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,340
He later argued that

680
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,080
In fact, all newborns should be in

681
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,800
Vaccines are given when newborns are born

682
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,320
Then he brought this concept to Taiwan

683
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,160
Later on vaccination policy

684
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,120
Select the newborn as the target

685
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,960
Benchmarks for making decisions on vaccination policies across Taiwan

686
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,840
And also become the World Health Organization

687
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,600
Also like this suggestion

688
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,080
Babies around the world should be getting hepatitis B

689
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,160
Vaccinations and start at birth

690
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,440
so i am very grateful

691
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,760
I think our people in Taiwan

692
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,800
I really want to thank Professor Bisley for his

693
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,360
this important study

694
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,680
Then he did three very important studies

695
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,880
Introduce you here

696
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,240
The first one is the newborn just mentioned

697
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,800
He later drew a picture like this

698
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:55,120
to present a brief illustration of his past research

699
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,880
Then this Ling is zero years old

700
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,520
if he is a newborn

701
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,960
Then he was infected by his mother

702
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,360
In fact, these mothers are all positive for medical antigens.

703
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,440
S antigen positive double positive carrier

704
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,840
Then 90% of these newborns

705
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,300
Later in his life he almost became

706
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,600
a chronic infection condition

707
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,080
He did a second study

708
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,380
It's next door to National Taiwan University Hospital

709
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,280
At that time, the city center made a

710
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,600
A kindergarten in the inner city was set up

711
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,480
Right next to our National Taiwan University Hospital

712
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,800
He put these preschool kindergarten children

713
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,240
to do research

714
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,540
He saw that these children

715
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,940
He did his research first

716
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,640
And then he helped him track it down a year later and two years later

717
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,940
It was discovered that if these children were infected

718
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,840
Children about two to four years old

719
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,940
About one in four children are infected

720
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,240
About 23%

721
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,940
He became a chronic carrier condition

722
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,540
Then he did a third study

723
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,140
at National Taiwan University

724
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,580
He draws blood from incoming students at Taiwan University

725
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,740
Then in Taiwan college students graduate

726
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,940
When the fourth grade is about to graduate

727
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,540
he draws blood again

728
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,040
Then he saw that if he was not infected the first time

729
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
When graduating from fourth grade

730
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
but saw that he was infected

731
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
What about him?

732
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
He saw their new infection status

733
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
then he saw them

734
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
How did it turn into a chronic infection?

735
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
found that they were 2.7%

736
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
about 3%

737
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
become a generational condition

738
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So you can see this curve

739
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
is along with the horizontal axis is age

740
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
With the increase of age on the horizontal axis

741
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
after infection

742
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
A condition that becomes a chronic generation

743
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
in a reduced state

744
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So it can be seen that the younger the child

745
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The more I can't stand this kind of infection

746
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
His immunity can't overcome the virus

747
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Then it becomes a surrender to the virus

748
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
become a chronic infection

749
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The condition of being under the control of the virus for life

750
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Even later, the phenomenon of liver cancer

751
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So I think his studies

752
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
are very far-reaching

753
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That also proves that good research

754
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
really forever and ever

755
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
human health

756
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,400
Of course, because we saw children with liver cancer

757
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,400
We also did some research on liver cancer

758
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,640
Why do we think these children are different from adults?

759
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,200
It takes 40 to 60 years for adults to develop cancer

760
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,040
These kids spent years

761
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,640
Maybe six years, seven years, ten years

762
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,800
he has cancer

763
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,440
so fast situation

764
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,200
He's growing cancer really fast

765
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,000
Let's just look at these kids

766
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,360
The mothers of our patients with liver cancer

767
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
Finding out about our liver cancer mothers

768
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,880
94% of children's mothers

769
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,960
It's all Dai Yuan's mother

770
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,280
Said that these mothers are generation

771
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,160
Her mother and child instead of a child infected from the level

772
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,160
It seems to be the subject of liver cancer

773
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,680
levels seem to be less likely to cause childhood liver cancer

774
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,760
In contrast we have a group

775
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,360
generation of children we go to track them to do long-term

776
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,480
In fact, these children are often tracked by us.

777
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,720
Twenty or thirty years have grown up

778
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,560
many grow up

779
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
These kids have grown up in fifty years

780
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Half of his mother is the situation of Dai Yuan

781
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
is very different

782
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
These are kids without liver cancer

783
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's study further

784
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Using liver cancer tissue for research

785
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Found that these children with liver cancer

786
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
his cancerous neighbor

787
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
those are the same people

788
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
His liver cells that didn't grow cancer

789
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
81% of those with liver cirrhosis

790
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Said that this liver cirrhosis is so fast

791
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Let's say he's six years old and he has cirrhosis

792
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
same as adult

793
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's about 80%

794
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
is the condition that produces this liver cirrhosis

795
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So children and adults develop liver cancer

796
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
seems like

797
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
type B liver cancer

798
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Just don't know why in terms of speed

799
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
so fast he walks so fast

800
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Actually my patient

801
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
He had cirrhosis of the liver sometimes at the age of two

802
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
then a few years later

803
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
after five to ten years

804
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
he developed liver cancer

805
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
just watched him recover from liver cirrhosis

806
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
on the road to liver cancer

807
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
This looks very

808
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,360
very sad

809
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,880
Let's do this liver cancer tissue

810
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,200
discovered that these children with liver cancer

811
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,760
Two-thirds of their liver cancer tissue

812
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
HBV

813
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,960
It has gone into the human liver gene

814
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,560
the gene of the virus

815
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,080
become part of human genes

816
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,040
we mean

817
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,920
Involved in our human genes

818
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
next to the liver

819
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,360
cirrhosis without liver cancer

820
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,720
These liver tissues are about 22%

821
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,920
Hepatitis B virus gene

822
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,080
Into our human genes

823
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,600
but the other way around

824
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,960
If the child does not have liver cancer

825
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,120
Probably it is 0%

826
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,200
Without this virus, it would be drawn into its liver tissue

827
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,160
so it's very different

828
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
I'm here to introduce

829
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,720
when i was very young

830
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,880
a story encountered

831
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
really very true story

832
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
There is a Mr. Fishing

833
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
he was on a boat

834
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
By boat from Penghu

835
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
come to Taiwan

836
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
with his wife and children

837
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
This kid is called Ah Hua

838
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He is from Penghu

839
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
was referred by his doctor

840
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Come to National Taiwan University Hospital to see me

841
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
because he said

842
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
There is a tumor growing in Ah Hua's stomach

843
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
so wish i came to see him like this

844
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll test Ah Hua's blood

845
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Ah Hua

846
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
in his blood

847
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Hepatitis B surface antigen

848
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
is positive

849
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
i have a habit

850
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
If this child is like this

851
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I will help his parents

852
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
have come

853
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
just help him check

854
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
found to say

855
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
his parents

856
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
hepatitis B surface antigen

857
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
positive person

858
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I made him a stomach

859
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Chaotic neck

860
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I found it in Ah Hua's stomach

861
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
have large liver cancer

862
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And this liver cancer

863
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
very very big

864
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
dissatisfied with the size of his entire liver

865
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
so there is no way

866
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,400
That is to say, he is a well-behaved kid.

867
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,240
so there is no cure

868
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,500
Then I will often help his parents to be a parent by the way.

869
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,400
I was surprised to find that I didn't expect it

870
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,240
His dad also had a tumor in his stomach

871
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,840
It's also a very, very large stem cancer.

872
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,540
At the same time found out that this is a true story

873
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,600
So at that time, I felt very sorry for his mother.

874
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,500
Of course his mother is very sad

875
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,000
because the three of them came

876
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,500
Turns out two people got stem cancer

877
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Another condition that cannot be treated by tacit understanding

878
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,800
So at that time I was a young physician

879
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,300
very ashamed

880
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm a doctor who can't help people

881
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,800
I am very ashamed

882
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,300
So I could only tell him that there was no other way.

883
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300
I can't have a fetus, and I can't do any treatment.

884
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,000
Just give him a little travel money

885
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,500
just let them go back to friends

886
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,000
So actually

887
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,440
This experience happens over and over again

888
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Sometimes I see two brothers in my family with liver cancer

889
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,440
Or the parent and the child are in the condition of liver cancer

890
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,440
Of course, I really hope there is a way

891
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
can treat patients

892
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,680
But in fact, my abilities are very limited.

893
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,240
Looks like it won't help them

894
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,280
very miserable

895
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,080
So I think it should be that we should think of a way

896
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,000
Including such a small child to get such a serious disease

897
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We should do a good job of controlling cancer

898
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
There are actually three strategies for cancer control

899
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The first is cancer prevention

900
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
This should be the best way

901
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
We keep us humans from getting cancer

902
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
how nice it is

903
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This should be the best policy

904
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
The second, of course, is how we

905
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
After the cancer has been obtained, the person can give him a good screening

906
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
find him earlier

907
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
if it was very small

908
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Can he be removed within two or three centimeters?

909
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,440
If there is no other way, of course it is to help him with the best treatment.

910
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,680
It is the best treatment. What kind of good method can cure cancer?

911
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,440
That's certainly something we'd very much like to do

912
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,680
It’s just that there are still many unsatisfactory aspects of cancer treatment so far.

913
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,480
There are still many places to continue to work hard

914
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,760
So how do we save ourselves from the pain of disease, especially cancer?

915
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,720
Of course we need to find out what's causing him.

916
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,520
We have to do the best strategy for him to control him

917
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,640
In the three aspects mentioned above, prevention should be more effective than treatment

918
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,760
It's best if you don't get sick

919
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,560
So how can cancer be prevented?

920
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,680
In fact, cancer prevention can be divided into three levels

921
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,760
The first level is for all the people, including everyone here

922
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,160
All people, regardless of age, can prevent it

923
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,080
don't get cancer

924
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
This is the best way, this is the first phase of treatment

925
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
prevention

926
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What about the second episode?

927
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
He already knows that he is a high-risk group

928
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Then target him to prevent him

929
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
there is one object in particular

930
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
we are going to prevent him

931
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What about the prevention in the third episode?

932
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
he has cancer

933
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Then the doctor treated him

934
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Then we have to prevent him from relapsing again.

935
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So the third episode is relatively late

936
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It means you have cancer

937
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
we want him not to happen again

938
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But we also know people like this

939
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
In fact, inside his body

940
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
have had some precancerous changes

941
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Although not long

942
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But he is already

943
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
enter a comparison

944
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There may be some changes in this organization

945
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
For example, he has cirrhosis of the liver, etc.

946
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
these conditions

947
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So primary prevention

948
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
we all feel the best

949
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
What are the methods?

950
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
for all the people

951
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Can primary prevention be done?

952
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The best thing, I think, is the vaccine.

953
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
If a vaccine can be used

954
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
If it can prevent cancer

955
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
that would be great

956
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
he is cheap and effective

957
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
It also saves time and is not heavy

958
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,320
The second one is to use this

959
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,680
Avoid cancer-causing risk behaviors and environments

960
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,880
For example, we should avoid smoking

961
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,920
avoid alcohol avoid obesity

962
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,080
Avoid low comfort facilities

963
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,640
And avoid lack of exercise and so on

964
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,960
is possible or has been proven

965
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,200
very well documented

966
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,800
is related to cancer

967
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,000
we should all avoid it

968
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,960
It's primary prevention

969
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,840
But of course it's what you do all your life

970
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Not just a shot

971
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,320
The third is of course chemoprevention.

972
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,040
That is to say, use some natural

973
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,560
Now many people are developing

974
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,200
Use some natural or synthetic substances

975
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,040
such as drugs

976
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,600
vitamins

977
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,880
Some people say that taking vitamin A or

978
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,840
eat some vitamins

979
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,280
or vitamin E, etc.

980
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,920
and eat some healthy food

981
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,240
or when the hormones

982
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,640
etc.

983
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,780
can be used to prevent the formation of this cancer

984
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,480
and prevention of invasive cancer

985
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,980
What about these theories?

986
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:10,880
In fact, it is often seen in newspapers and magazines.

987
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,180
some of that is true

988
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,980
some of them are fake

989
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,920
there are some that have been proven effective

990
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,940
For example, some

991
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,720
Lei Hemeng's handwriting

992
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,560
It appears to prevent breast cancer

993
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,860
50% of the preventive effect is

994
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,060
Something like Tamoxifen seems to be quite effective

995
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:28,820
But what?

996
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,020
In fact, many of them have been proven to be ineffective.

997
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:36,060
So there are many, many clinical trials and so on

998
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,760
still in progress

999
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,100
I hope there will be more chemoprevention methods in the future

1000
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,240
can prevent cancer

1001
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,280
Then here I use liver cancer

1002
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,500
Primary and secondary prevention of liver cancer

1003
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,740
with tertiary prevention

1004
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,980
Let me tell you about the prevention of liver cancer

1005
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,380
That primary prevention is against

1006
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,880
all general public

1007
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
that its cost

1008
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,600
because the hepatitis B vaccine is cheap

1009
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,000
Then it is also very effective

1010
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
then it takes very little time

1011
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
it only takes three doses

1012
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's just a prick and three doses and it's done.

1013
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
It's probably over from the time the kid was born until he was six months old.

1014
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
The side effects are very low

1015
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's the part where the injection will hurt.

1016
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
In fact, it has no obvious side effects

1017
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Then it uses the hepatitis B vaccine

1018
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Then it is aimed at newborns and babies.

1019
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
To prevent them from developing chronic hepatitis B virus infection and liver cancer

1020
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
so this is the best way

1021
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
that in liver cancer

1022
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Secondary prevention is the use of antiviral drugs

1023
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
What about antiviral drugs?

1024
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It is mainly aimed at high-risk groups

1025
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That is to say, people who have been chronically infected with hepatitis B virus

1026
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
give it this drug

1027
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Those who received injections or took medicine

1028
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Of course it costs more

1029
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
because it's going to take a while

1030
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If you take medicine, take it every day

1031
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
eat this for several years

1032
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,320
So his effect is of course not as high as the vaccine.

1033
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,440
The effect of prevention

1034
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,840
it will take several years

1035
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,680
that sometimes there are some side effects

1036
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,280
Like injections of interferon, there will be some obvious side effects

1037
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,320
What about taking medicine?

1038
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,040
some few equal side effects

1039
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,120
most people are

1040
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,440
no obvious side effects

1041
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,720
However, there may be resistance

1042
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,320
Then this is mainly for the prevention of chronic infection

1043
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,400
he produces

1044
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,840
The phenomenon of liver cancer

1045
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,640
What about tertiary prevention?

1046
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,320
people who have had cancer

1047
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,400
Then use this antiviral drug

1048
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,360
hope he can prevent him

1049
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,120
Do not relapse

1050
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,880
That is also using the same

1051
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,920
use this antiviral drug

1052
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,280
Injections or medication

1053
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,640
So his side effects and his cost effects, etc.

1054
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,320
are also very similar

1055
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,840
But what?

1056
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,440
Among them, his effect should be the worst.

1057
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,880
because he has got cancer

1058
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,880
had cancer

1059
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,920
So in this prevention of relapse

1060
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,040
The effect will be more limited

1061
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,040
So, we use antiviral drugs

1062
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Drugs for the prevention of secondary or tertiary liver cancer

1063
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It has been shown to slow the severity of the disease

1064
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
can slow down the progression of the disease

1065
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So especially for people with liver cirrhosis to prevent liver cancer

1066
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
it helps

1067
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It's a problem because of the antiviral drugs we're currently using

1068
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
In fact, it is not the most ideal

1069
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Because it still has no way to integrate the entire

1070
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
From incomplete DNA to a complete DNA in the nucleus

1071
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
We just saw that diagram is the so-called template for viral replication

1072
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
It needs to print a lot of viruses and produce a lot of small viruses.

1073
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
none of it was removed

1074
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So the virus infection still continues to take medicine

1075
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
If you stop taking the medicine

1076
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Maybe the virus will grow and recur

1077
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
it just suppresses it

1078
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
At the same time it must be taken for a long time

1079
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
It needs to be used for a long time like three to five years

1080
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So it will be more expensive

1081
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
And if you take it for a long time, you may develop drug resistance.

1082
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Although new drugs

1083
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
drug resistance has outperformed older older versions of the drug

1084
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
medicine comes much lower

1085
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
However, resistance may still exist

1086
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
so talk

1087
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Primary prevention is the best

1088
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
We come by vaccination of nationwide baby

1089
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
prevent stem cancer

1090
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Arguably the most effective way to prevent stem cancer

1091
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
so we're going to talk

1092
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Hepatitis Vaccine and Prevention of Liver Cancer

1093
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
if we want to say

1094
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
If we are vaccinated

1095
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
If it can prevent cancer

1096
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
that would be great

1097
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Just a few injections can prevent cancer

1098
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Vaccine against hepatitis

1099
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Let's make this dream come true

1100
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Because Taiwan suffers from children

1101
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Ratio to recognized liver cancer

1102
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
is higher than many other countries in the world

1103
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So we in Taiwan are working hard to invest in

1104
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
The Pythonitis and liver cancer

1105
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
research on prevention

1106
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,600
it's very meaningful

1107
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,760
And what about chronic infection with rhinohepatitis virus?

1108
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,520
Most of it starts with seduction

1109
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,580
So we're all very mindful of saying

1110
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,520
The prevention of nasal hepatitis should start from infants

1111
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,620
From the first day of birth

1112
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,240
In fact, it starts from birth

1113
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,720
even we'll mention later

1114
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,360
Maybe from the pregnant mother

1115
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
It starts before it's born

1116
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,600
Then briefly introduce the vaccination of nasal hepatitis

1117
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,560
It is actually divided into two categories

1118
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,960
Vaccination against nasal hepatitis

1119
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,520
Can be divided into active immunity and passive immunity

1120
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,560
The so-called active immunization means that I get vaccinated

1121
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,240
Passive immunity means that I have not been vaccinated

1122
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,760
So I can't develop immunity on my own

1123
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,720
but i took some immunoglobulin

1124
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,440
What is immunoglobulin?

1125
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,960
It's when someone else gets sick and gets better

1126
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,080
produce some protective antibodies

1127
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,120
Then collect it through the manufacturer

1128
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,800
and after condensing it

1129
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,500
then become a needle

1130
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,660
and hit me inside

1131
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,160
then help me temporarily

1132
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,160
it may be effective for several months

1133
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,500
circulating in my body

1134
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,200
come help me fight this

1135
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,760
This virus that has invaded my body

1136
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,600
so wait a minute we mentioned newborns

1137
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,500
His mother gave him the pregnancy symptoms

1138
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,260
production process extrusion process

1139
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,960
into a fairly large number of viruses

1140
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,800
Go inside the newborn's body

1141
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,900
so we are newborn

1142
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,860
within 24 hours of birth

1143
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,100
going to play this

1144
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,060
Immunoglobulin blue for hepatitis

1145
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,100
prevent this

1146
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,860
The virus that has entered the body

1147
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,600
then why

1148
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,060
Then why not just get vaccinated?

1149
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,300
Because of vaccination in newborns

1150
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,360
he needs to produce antibodies

1151
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,100
he needs a while

1152
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,060
Probably at least a week or two

1153
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,620
And to two gifts

1154
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,500
to a month

1155
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,660
In fact, we used to measure

1156
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,920
after a dose

1157
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,620
Only about 50% of people

1158
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,860
able to detect antibodies

1159
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,100
So the other 50%

1160
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,100
In fact, it is impossible to measure

1161
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,200
He still needs a second dose and a third dose.

1162
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,940
and he will last forever

1163
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
must rely on the third dose

1164
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
to be truly durable

1165
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
In the History of the Invention of the Making of Hepatitis B

1166
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
it has two generations of vaccines

1167
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
The first generation is made of plasma

1168
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
is to treat patients who already have hepatitis B

1169
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
chronic hepatitis

1170
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
A person with a lot of viruses in his body

1171
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
His blood is used for this vaccine

1172
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
save it

1173
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The second generation is genetically engineered

1174
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
just avoid the blood

1175
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Use this genetic engineering method to make

1176
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
relatively avoided

1177
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
conditions that may contaminate the virus

1178
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,000
situation

1179
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
That mentions this hepatitis B surface antigen

1180
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
And the hepatitis B virus

1181
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
we must mention this

1182
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Professor Bramberg

1183
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Professor Bramberg

1184
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Because he is the historical

1185
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
The person who discovered this hepatitis B surface antigen

1186
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
He was originally researching

1187
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
some genetic diseases

1188
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But he also travels all over the world

1189
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
For example, he went to Australia

1190
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
to study this native

1191
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
his native

1192
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,880
Take their blood and find a new antigen

1193
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,980
He called it the Australian Antigen

1194
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,420
He found that the Australian antigens were the same as those in the United States

1195
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,280
The leukemia patients he collected

1196
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,560
and some mediterranean patients

1197
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,100
some antigens in his blood

1198
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,720
He doesn't know what it is, both are the same thing

1199
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,500
Later, further research found that

1200
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,100
original Australian antigen

1201
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,340
He is actually closely related to hepatitis

1202
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,740
And it turned out that he was closely related to hepatitis B

1203
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:35,980
More evidence that he is the so-called hepatitis B surface antigen

1204
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,420
It's the surface antigen we just mentioned

1205
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,520
He also knew that later he found out that

1206
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,580
If antibodies to surface antigens are available

1207
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,620
He's just saying he already has protective antibodies.

1208
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,980
So he was in 1976

1209
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,020
In 1965 he published a paper

1210
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,980
He won the Nobel Prize in 1976

1211
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,020
the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

1212
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
while speaking

1213
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
What about the person who actually invented the vaccine?

1214
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
It's Hearman. It's Dr. Hearman.

1215
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Dr Hillman he's very smart

1216
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
He has made many kinds of vaccines in his life

1217
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Not just the hepatitis B vaccine

1218
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
then he has a hypothesis

1219
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
he very cleverly thought of saying

1220
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
If we take hepatitis B

1221
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Surface antigen, this protein hits the human body

1222
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Does the human body produce antibodies?

1223
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Then is it possible to protect this person?

1224
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
not infected

1225
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
he assumes

1226
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
He made a bold hypothesis

1227
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Actually no one ever said that

1228
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Then he not only assumes

1229
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
and he does

1230
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
He realizes his ideal

1231
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
He took some patient's serum

1232
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Chronic infection that already has that infection

1233
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
A person with a lot of viruses in his body

1234
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
his blood

1235
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
take him out

1236
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Then use three treatment methods to remove sanitary objects

1237
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
pepsin

1238
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Digestive efficiency

1239
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Then use the urine count

1240
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,400
he used fake punches

1241
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,760
He went to make him the dimensional creature

1242
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,760
devitrification

1243
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,620
He made his infection no longer exist

1244
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,940
Then he does strict filtering

1245
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,640
then do this

1246
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,940
The vaccine he felt was safe

1247
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,540
But when he made it, no one dared to use it.

1248
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,640
Because it's made from a patient

1249
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,120
Then he went through a lot of procedures

1250
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,280
Of course he also went to convince a lot of people

1251
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,620
Then he used this in the United States

1252
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
gay

1253
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,060
In fact, they are some AIDS

1254
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,220
Then I thought it must be AIDS patients

1255
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,700
Then they prevent this

1256
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,860
that he found effective

1257
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,820
Of course this is

1258
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,340
Later, Professor Beasley and the others introduced

1259
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,540
Want to come to Taiwan to do clinical work

1260
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:47,700
Give this baby in Taiwan a shot

1261
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,960
Of course, Taiwan also encountered great resistance.

1262
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,460
How Taiwanese Babies Can Become

1263
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,620
The guinea pig of the world

1264
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,780
so this is

1265
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,420
Doing these experiments for the first time in the past

1266
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
people work very hard

1267
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But they are also very

1268
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
we admire them

1269
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
also very great

1270
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Valenzuela later taught Dr.

1271
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
they these

1272
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
they have this

1273
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Scientific progress can be done with genetic engineering

1274
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Use this filial mother fungus

1275
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Use that EcoLine

1276
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
coli

1277
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
filial mother fungus

1278
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
can do this genetic engineering

1279
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Then mass production of protein

1280
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
so they thought

1281
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Then we will do the second generation

1282
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Genetically engineered vaccines

1283
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So the one on the left is the first generation vaccine

1284
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Take a look with an electron microscope

1285
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Particles with many surface antigens

1286
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The one on the right is the second generation

1287
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
genetically engineered vaccine

1288
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
He used this filial mother fungus to do a lot of

1289
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
barrel by barrel production

1290
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
made very similar

1291
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Hepatitis B surface antigen particles

1292
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
one by one

1293
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
If we take out the patient's serum

1294
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Particles, but he still has the virus

1295
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Elongated hepatitis B surface

1296
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So we see that he is genetically engineered

1297
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
The gene of this type B liver heart surface antigen

1298
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
put it in the yeast

1299
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Then in the body of the yeast

1300
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
just give him a lot of stretching

1301
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and harvest lots and lots of yeast

1302
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Then save this

1303
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Hepatic heart surface antigen type B protein

1304
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
become like this

1305
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
So the vaccine itself is relatively

1306
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I feel that everyone is more at ease

1307
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Because he didn't do it from the patient's blood

1308
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
He used this method of true gene preservation

1309
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
So there is no genetic material from the virus

1310
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
no DNA

1311
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So it's safer

1312
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So we can see from the picture on the left

1313
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Hepatic heart surface antigen type B

1314
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
There is no gene for the whole type B liver heart

1315
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
only surface antigens

1316
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Then he put this coliform

1317
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Then put it in the yeast

1318
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Then you can stretch a lot

1319
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Then he went through some storage and transformation processes

1320
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
add some vice jockey and so on

1321
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
and finally mass-produced

1322
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
send all over the world

1323
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
to fight like this

1324
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The second generation of genetic engineering hospitals is more advanced than the first generation

1325
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Everyone is more at ease

1326
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But here, if there are friends born between 1984 and 1992,

1327
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
In fact, you are all playing the first generation.

1328
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It's the original first generation

1329
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
But it's all good, right?

1330
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
all very safe

1331
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
It's actually very safe

1332
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Why?

1333
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Because the first generation was also tested by that chimpanzee

1334
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So chimps don't get sick

1335
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
that's okay

1336
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
It means that in this vaccine, the infectious substances including HIV have been removed

1337
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
So this hepatitis B vaccine

1338
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
It is the first successful anti-cancer vaccine in humans

1339
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Then there are many advantages of using this vaccine to prevent cancer

1340
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
because it is a primary prevention

1341
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
so it can target all people

1342
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
All people can be prevented from infection

1343
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
never happen to this kid

1344
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm fine like this

1345
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So this is really a plus for all

1346
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
A very good approach for all the populace

1347
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
and it's cheap

1348
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
also very safe

1349
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I just mentioned that it saves time

1350
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It is three injections. In the early days, it was four injections and later it became three injections.

1351
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
very efficient

1352
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Its anti-cancer benefits will be mentioned later

1353
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The benefit is quite good

1354
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
and can be easily implemented

1355
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
In fact, there is no one way to prevent cancer

1356
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
works as well as this

1357
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
so really good

1358
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and it's a routine that can be put into babies

1359
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
inside the vaccination

1360
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
There is a rule to get various vaccines

1361
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Vaccines that include this type B liver cancer

1362
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
it can also

1363
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
There are some cancer vaccines like the uterine checkpoint vaccine

1364
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
it will be available to students in schools

1365
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
For example, a large number of students in girls' schools are beaten

1366
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Playing in school is still very good

1367
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Easy to hit, you can hit a lot

1368
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
so how to prove

1369
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
or how to design

1370
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
a good cancer

1371
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
What about the vaccine?

1372
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It must at least meet the following three points

1373
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
First

1374
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
this vaccine you made

1375
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
against a creature?

1376
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
To prove that this dimensional creature is

1377
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,500
cancers you want to prevent

1378
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,500
There is a very close causal relationship

1379
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,500
For example, if the hepatitis B virus is the dimensional organism

1380
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Then we have to prove that hepatitis B, a vitamin

1381
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,500
is closely related to liver cancer

1382
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,500
this is the most important point

1383
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
They have a relationship so you can prevent it

1384
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:22,500
and then become a vaccine against cancer

1385
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,000
The second thing to prove is that

1386
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
The vaccine itself is really hit

1387
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,500
Effective in preventing the infection of this vitamin

1388
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,500
like the hepatitis B vaccine

1389
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,500
Is it really possible to prevent

1390
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,500
Hepatitis B virus infection

1391
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,500
We're going to prove that it really works

1392
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,500
We'll present some evidence later

1393
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,500
show everyone

1394
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,500
The third one is of course very important

1395
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,500
That means we got the vaccine

1396
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,500
Can prevent the infection of this vitamin

1397
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,500
That's really going to prevent the infection in the end.

1398
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,500
rather than just being able to prevent that

1399
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,500
There is no way to prevent this infection

1400
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,500
it's not that hard

1401
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,500
So we say the hepatitis B vaccine

1402
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,560
Can really prevent liver cancer

1403
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,160
We're going to come up with real evidence to prove it

1404
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,360
After satisfying these three characteristics

1405
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,000
can we say

1406
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,360
This should be a successful hampered vaccine

1407
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,360
so let's see

1408
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,400
Because Taiwan is the first country in the world to implement

1409
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,080
Full blown newborn

1410
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,880
Countries that have completed liver cancer vaccines

1411
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,480
So we have this opportunity to study

1412
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,680
Is it real

1413
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,480
Bixing liver cancer vaccine can hinder

1414
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,920
This is from July 1, 1984

1415
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,880
So July 1, 1984

1416
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,720
What about babies born after the 1st?

1417
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,920
There is a chance to get the vaccine against Bixing liver cancer

1418
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,680
That mentions the whole of Taiwan

1419
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,400
Bixing Liver Cancer Vaccine

1420
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,120
start building this policy

1421
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,560
We want to thank many predecessors

1422
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,960
many people

1423
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,880
In the middle, I think what I just mentioned

1424
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,680
Professor Bisri's contribution is really great

1425
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,560
Not only did he introduce the concept of mother-child transmission

1426
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,280
And he did

1427
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,120
He and my teacher Professor Li Qingyun

1428
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Jointly achieved Taiwan's first hepatitis

1429
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
This clinical trial of vaccination is carried out in Taiwan

1430
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That of course takes a lot of courage

1431
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Because many people will not want to participate in this clinical trial

1432
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And what about Professor Luo Guangrui?

1433
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
He also did a clinical trial with another baby

1434
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Of course there are Professor Song Ruiluo and Professor Chen Ding

1435
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And Professor Luo, Professor Bisley, Professor Li, etc.

1436
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Speaking of more scholars, they all explained to the government and the public

1437
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
This is necessary, this vaccination is necessary

1438
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Hepatitis should be prevented

1439
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Vaccinations should start on the new birthday

1440
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
These two concepts are what scholars from all walks of life have been promoting

1441
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Then I think the most important thing is our government officials

1442
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It was Li Guoding at that time called Mr. Li Guoding

1443
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
he should be a councilor

1444
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And Xu Ziqiu, Director Xu Ziqiu at that time

1445
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Director Xu, I think he is very wise and wise

1446
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
And he saw very far

1447
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So although there are many, in fact, many scholars have come out to oppose

1448
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
including some scholars I know

1449
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
They objected. They said that children from Taiwan cannot be regarded as the world's first batch of white mice.

1450
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
should not do this

1451
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
So there are voices against and voices in favor

1452
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But these two government officials are very courageous

1453
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
They start executing like this

1454
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Make a good plan and start executing it

1455
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And our people, I also think our people are very high-level

1456
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,000
They are all willing to cooperate with the government's policies

1457
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Hepatitis B

1458
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Get his newborn vaccinated

1459
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Hepatitis B vaccination design throughout Taiwan

1460
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
is a ten-year design

1461
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Since 1984

1462
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,000
During the two years from 1984 to 1986

1463
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
In the first two years of the internship, the plasma vaccine

1464
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The first generation of vaccines are played in free places

1465
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,740
There are children of mothers who are positive for hepatitis B surface anti-inflammation

1466
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,820
So at this time, it is necessary to do pregnancy screening first.

1467
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,020
Screening for hepatitis B surface anti-inflammatory and E anti-inflammatory in pregnant women

1468
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,340
then go see her

1469
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,620
At that time, the experiment in the front area was actually

1470
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,460
I also admire Professor Bisley very much

1471
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,380
he also said

1472
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,020
Mothers should test E anti-inflammatory and S anti-inflammatory

1473
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:22,340
In fact, to the United States today

1474
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,460
The United States only detects S anti-inflammatory

1475
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,580
He did not detect E anti-inflammatory

1476
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,100
Then Taiwan has always been

1477
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,860
Over the past 30 years, E anti-inflammatory and S anti-inflammatory have been tested

1478
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,580
I want to say that Professor Bisley has a great influence

1479
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,500
To this day, I still think E anti-inflammatory is very important

1480
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,620
Therefore, the design at that time gave him the child of the E anti-inflammatory positive mother.

1481
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:45,180
Immunoglobulin administered within 24 hours

1482
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:48,500
that when professor beasley passed away two years ago

1483
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,620
before his death

1484
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,980
He came to see me about two or three years ago.

1485
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,260
I still need to talk to Dean Chen Jianren

1486
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:56,540
He kept mentioning to me

1487
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,780
You want the people of Taiwan to be re-administered with immunoglobulin

1488
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,820
Earlier, not 20 hours, preferably 12 hours ago

1489
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,660
The sooner the better

1490
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,700
It has been staring at us in Taiwan to do better like this

1491
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,300
That started on July 1, 1986

1492
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,760
Just give the vaccine to all babies

1493
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,160
Since October 1992, it has been changed to

1494
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,760
The whole of Taiwan has been converted to genetically engineered vaccines

1495
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,600
That of course later included this preschooler

1496
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,960
he has catch up

1497
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,000
There are elementary school students to check

1498
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,760
What is Hepatitis without injection

1499
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,000
This immunization card needs to be checked

1500
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,400
Those who didn't fight will have to make up for it.

1501
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,000
Because we are in Taiwan

1502
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,960
So we are working with children again

1503
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,340
So there is this task

1504
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:46,400
In fact, I also feel that I have this mission.

1505
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,740
We should see what the result of the beating is.

1506
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,740
So I'm also lucky to be in

1507
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,540
The spring before July 1, 1984, before the vaccination

1508
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,640
in the spring of 1984

1509
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,080
Our children in Taipei did

1510
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,380
What about a popular end-of-school research with that application?

1511
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,780
Find out that all these children above the age of two

1512
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:14,460
About 10% of the children are Bixing hepatitis, surface anti-inflammatory positive

1513
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,660
Ethnicity is Bixing Hepatitis Surface Anti-inflammatory Positive Rate

1514
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,020
so very high

1515
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:23,500
Then this as a benchmark value is the generation before vaccination

1516
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:28,500
Then we will do it every five years in the same area

1517
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:33,500
I found that after five years of red line, children under the age of five will all drop

1518
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,000
ten years after that green

1519
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,300
purple fifteen years later

1520
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,700
light blue twenty years later

1521
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,500
And what about this orange color twenty-five years later

1522
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:48,500
I found out that these children who have been beaten are all low

1523
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,000
Those who have not been beaten are high

1524
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,500
So vaccinations really work

1525
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:59,000
Just drop his surface anti-inflammatory positive rate to less than one percent on average.

1526
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
About 0.5% to

1527
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,400
About 1% in these vaccinated generations

1528
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Of course it's high if you haven't played before.

1529
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,000
So we can draw a conclusion that

1530
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,240
All people forced to vaccinate

1531
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,800
Prevented about 90% of

1532
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,360
Chronic liver infection in rhinohepatitis

1533
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,160
What used to be 10% has become less than 1%

1534
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,000
that's so effective

1535
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,240
It prevents 90% of

1536
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,560
but not 100%

1537
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,080
Actually wait a minute we also mentioned

1538
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,520
What about the remaining 10%?

1539
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,480
That's not only in Taiwan

1540
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,480
And in every state of the world

1541
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,480
have similar results

1542
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,480
For example, as shown in this figure

1543
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,480
gambia in africa

1544
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,480
it just dropped from 10% to 0.6

1545
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,480
Taiwan in Asia

1546
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,480
China

1547
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,480
saudi arabia

1548
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,520
Indonesia

1549
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,480
Thailand etc.

1550
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,480
There is also a marked decline in

1551
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,480
what about in america

1552
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,480
like alaska

1553
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,520
that's in europe

1554
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,480
like italy

1555
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,440
Wait, there is a very obvious decline

1556
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,440
So this phenomenon

1557
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
In fact, except for Taiwan

1558
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
After seeing the results in Taiwan

1559
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Many countries have also started

1560
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Implement universal vaccination

1561
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
With the promotion of the World Health Organization

1562
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
so almost universal

1563
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Everyone has a very noticeable decline

1564
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
The condition of chronic generation of Hepatitis

1565
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Next we want

1566
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Further explore the third question

1567
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Bixing hepatitis status

1568
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Infections have declined

1569
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
90% and 10% left

1570
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
So does liver cancer also exist?

1571
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
successfully dropped

1572
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So we just want to see

1573
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
children in taiwan

1574
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
because if we want to see adults

1575
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
probably until 2024

1576
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Because the adult peak is between 40 and 60 years old

1577
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Might have to wait until peak season

1578
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Probably after 2024

1579
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
It's been too long to wait like this

1580
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
So we know that children in Taiwan

1581
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
There is a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma

1582
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
So we thought maybe

1583
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
We can use children with liver cancer

1584
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
let's take a look

1585
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Is it already effective for children with liver cancer

1586
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
So we see kids from six to nineteen

1587
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
With the assistance of Vice President Chen

1588
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Let's take a look at the situation of liver cancer together.

1589
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
found that he said that if we take the birth generation

1590
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
is the generation before vaccination

1591
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
with his hepatocellular carcinoma

1592
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
say six to nine years old

1593
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
He is 50 million to the fifth power of food

1594
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Then after liver cancer prevention injection

1595
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Birth drops to 0.15

1596
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So if we take this incidence rate as 1,

1597
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Then his incidence ratio is 0.3

1598
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That is, divide 0.15 by 50 million to get 0.3

1599
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
What does 0.3 mean?

1600
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It means 30%

1601
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So he goes from 100% which is 1 to 30% like this

1602
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
the same 10 to 14 year olds

1603
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
15 to 19 are also reduced to 30% to 32%

1604
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
So we can say

1605
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
70% reduction in incidence of liver cancer

1606
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,260
remaining 30%

1607
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,260
So it's also very effective

1608
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,060
Well, we have actually done some acute hepatitis and violent hepatitis

1609
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:11,260
It was found that there is a decline

1610
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,760
just because of time

1611
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,260
so we don't show those results here

1612
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,560
So we can say that chronic hepatitis

1613
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,060
From our research just now it appears that

1614
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,060
90% gone, 10% left

1615
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:28,660
Then about 70% of hepatocellular carcinoma disappeared and the remaining 30%

1616
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,660
So we can say that the study of Taiwanese children

1617
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,660
What can tell us about the hepatitis B vaccine

1618
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:38,660
It should be the first successful anti-cancer vaccine in humans

1619
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,660
Hepatitis B Vaccine Its Anti-Cancer Effect

1620
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,660
Has gradually progressed from children to adolescents

1621
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,660
We've just seen 19

1622
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,660
In fact, from our recent data we see that it

1623
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:53,660
Gradually extended to the very young adult sequence

1624
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,660
So such an outcome could be used as a preventive

1625
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,660
Others are good

1626
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:59,660
or

1627
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,440
A Reference to Bacteria-Associated Cancers

1628
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,640
Should be a good reference for driving

1629
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,840
The World Health Organization is certainly seeing these results

1630
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,920
When they were at the World Health Assembly in 1992

1631
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,800
Just by saying that to advise all children in the world

1632
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,960
Vaccines are used to prevent hepatitis B

1633
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,040
WHO recommends

1634
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,840
All babies should be born after

1635
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,680
I'm going to get the hepatitis B vaccine right away

1636
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,920
It is best to inject within 24 hours of birth

1637
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,280
So he pushes the 24-hour dose

1638
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,080
Of course we also know that many countries in the world

1639
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,200
Some people live in relatively backward areas

1640
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,640
They were not born in a hospital

1641
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,360
So give him a call as soon as he is born

1642
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,880
Otherwise, he will run away and can't be hit.

1643
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:54,160
So in 2012 he counted 94 member states

1644
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:57,920
are already promoting a 24-hour birth dose

1645
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,240
injection for hepatitis B

1646
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,320
The latest data in 2013

1647
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,700
This is in the data of the World Health Organization

1648
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,260
Information updated on July 1, 2015

1649
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,820
can be seen

1650
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:10,380
Horrors in 2013

1651
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:11,980
It can be seen from this figure

1652
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,220
It went from 23 countries all the way up to 183

1653
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,220
In 2013 has increased to 183 member states

1654
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,620
have reached the third dose

1655
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,920
The entire third-dose country

1656
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,380
Incorporate into this plan

1657
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,720
is to promote

1658
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,920
The Bishop's hepatitis vaccination in the baby's

1659
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,120
Moreover, in these countries of the World Health Organization, it is investigated

1660
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,000
81% of children have accepted

1661
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,400
Three doses of hepatitis H vaccine

1662
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,360
So it's a very high success rate

1663
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,240
Of course we hope to reach 90%

1664
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,440
But 81% is pretty good

1665
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,680
Then this picture is a map of the world

1666
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,040
We can see that in dark blue

1667
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
That is, it has a coverage rate of three seasons of vaccination

1668
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
More than 90% of the countries

1669
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
already has a large area

1670
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
all blue

1671
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
very successful

1672
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But we also saw

1673
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
where there is crimson

1674
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
It is the coverage rate that is almost less than 50%

1675
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
very low vaccination rates

1676
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
what about the pink area

1677
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
is also relatively low

1678
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Probably from 50% to 79% or so

1679
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
are lower areas

1680
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
what about these areas

1681
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
In fact, in Southeast Asia

1682
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And Africa is the most

1683
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Of course we have seen some white countries

1684
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
these white countries

1685
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Are they all poor countries?

1686
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
actually not

1687
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
like this our neighbor japan

1688
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
There are also countries such as the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, etc.

1689
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
not very poor

1690
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
But what about their incidence rate is very low

1691
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,000
so they just

1692
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
The country will go to other vaccines

1693
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
What about the UK?

1694
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
He's going to fight human breast cancer

1695
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
that vaccine it is very expensive

1696
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Relatively more expensive

1697
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
On the contrary, it is the loss of the whole people

1698
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
All girls lose big

1699
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Japan is fortunate that it is in

1700
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
It should be from last year

1701
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I got a vaccination for all the people

1702
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Otherwise they mainly target

1703
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
High industry insurance group to do preventive injections

1704
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
It's not that you didn't hit right

1705
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Antipruritic

1706
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
method child

1707
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
the other this

1708
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
What about vaccines for cancer prevention?

1709
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Just now the vice president also mentioned

1710
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Uterine Well Cancer Vaccine

1711
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Vaccines for Uterine Well Cancer Prevention

1712
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So let's look at uterine well cancer

1713
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
uterine well cancer it is

1714
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Five evils of women

1715
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
one of the leading causes of cancer

1716
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
So it's very common

1717
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Around the world each year there are

1718
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
more than 200,000 women

1719
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
both died of uterine well cancer

1720
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
So there are a lot

1721
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Added worldwide

1722
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Uterine well cancer probably has

1723
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
500,000 to 600,000 cases

1724
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
This is the incidence

1725
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
This one just died

1726
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
mortality rate

1727
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,600
About one-fifth of them

1728
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,440
Is a woman in the Chinese world

1729
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,520
So it has a very close relationship with us

1730
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,040
So the same we use these three principles

1731
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,600
These three elements to see the status of the uterine examination

1732
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,200
Is it the human breast virus and the uterus?

1733
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,440
Is there a close relationship

1734
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,160
Is it just its healing vitamin?

1735
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,360
Human Latovirus Vaccine

1736
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:29,120
Is it really effective to prevent human

1737
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:34,240
produced to prevent infection by this human patovirus

1738
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,120
Prevention of Human Latovirus Infection

1739
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,680
Is it really possible to prevent cervical cancer?

1740
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,480
We're going to ask these three questions

1741
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,000
Of course, past research has actually

1742
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,440
lots of research

1743
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,720
Human Latovirus has been shown

1744
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:53,040
It is indeed the pathogen from the uterine examination.

1745
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,840
Let's take a look at this breast pass

1746
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,760
This is what the Human Latovirus looks like

1747
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,000
the human latex virus

1748
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,480
It's a sickness without a coat

1749
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,000
double bone DNA virus

1750
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,160
it's still a little virus

1751
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,240
It's about 8 KiloBase

1752
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,480
That's about 8000 muscle reduction

1753
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,160
we just mentioned

1754
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,600
Hepatitis is 3200 muscle-reducing

1755
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,680
it's slightly bigger

1756
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,600
but not too big

1757
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,800
It is about 8000 muscle reduction

1758
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,480
It can infect the skin and mucous membranes

1759
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,000
its epidermal cells

1760
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,120
but it's also complicated

1761
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,800
It has more than 100 kinds of

1762
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,840
Different lines of human milk soil

1763
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,480
Virus

1764
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,960
So of course when making the vaccine

1765
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,640
There are so many different lines to consider

1766
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,600
Can I be prevented by this vaccine?

1767
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,960
Then the final compromise is probably to find

1768
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,200
The industries that are most likely to cure cancer

1769
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,240
come as the first choice

1770
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:48,400
Object of the first-generation vaccine

1771
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,360
The human milk soil virus has 8 genes

1772
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,400
is what this place shows

1773
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,840
From this E1 E2 no E3

1774
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:57,360
Then go to E7 like this

1775
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,080
7

1776
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:58,640
7

1777
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,200
Burley bacteria is long

1778
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
In addition it has two bowl genes

1779
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Its bowl genes are L1 and L2

1780
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
This bowl gene was later used to make vaccines

1781
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
This bowl gene is responsible for encoding the coat protein of the virus

1782
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
capacity protein in its shell

1783
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So it can be used as a vaccine

1784
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
algal gene

1785
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Especially the two genes E6 and E7

1786
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
It is related to carcinogenic

1787
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
it interferes with the prime group

1788
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
the prime group it was violated

1789
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
This human cell gene transfer

1790
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
and cell cycle control

1791
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
So it will be carcinogenic

1792
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
It is very important that on the specimen of human uterine cancer

1793
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It can be found that 99.7 is almost close to 100%

1794
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Human papillomavirus DNA can be found

1795
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
its genetic material

1796
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Indicates the relationship between the two

1797
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
really very close

1798
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,400
There are many types of human lactoviruses

1799
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,520
But several of them are

1800
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,840
High-risk cancer-causing types

1801
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,240
its lineage

1802
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,640
It is the human primary keratinocytes

1803
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,360
can live forever

1804
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,520
So it means it can cause cancer

1805
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:19,080
If we block

1806
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,560
Human Latovirus in

1807
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,520
The very important algal genes just mentioned

1808
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,080
That is 1,6 and 1,7

1809
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,200
if it is a cancer-causing gene

1810
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,040
These cells can no longer survive

1811
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,800
There is no way to survive and reproduce

1812
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,200
will die

1813
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,200
So they are also quite directly related

1814
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,640
Carcinogenesis and lack of differentiation of epithelial cells

1815
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,960
is very closely related

1816
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,600
There is no way to differentiate, it will cause cancer

1817
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,360
Human Latovirus Gene

1818
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,840
are genes that can be embedded in this prime group

1819
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,440
It also causes the cells to fail to differentiate

1820
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,640
this phenomenon

1821
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,400
So Human Latovirus and

1822
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,200
Human uterine diseases are very

1823
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,720
very close relationship

1824
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:05,160
Then let's take a look at how it makes viruses

1825
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,100
See this with this cartoon

1826
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,340
Human breast figure

1827
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:12,320
Vaccines Human Mammogram Virus Vaccine Production

1828
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,080
of course

1829
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:17,060
Need to have a well researched basis to justify saying

1830
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,060
use this

1831
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,360
This tube gene this L1

1832
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,500
or L2 is correct

1833
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:26,000
If you use L1 L2 and trigger it to develop immunity

1834
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,260
is it possible to fight this

1835
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,940
Can develop immunity to fight against the invasion of this virus

1836
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,880
So take five of these L1 proteins

1837
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,360
put it together

1838
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,200
Then make a L1

1839
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:40,560
Granules are Capsule grains

1840
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,760
make a particle

1841
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:44,200
Then put this 72 particles

1842
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:45,600
blend it again

1843
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,340
just make a VLP

1844
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,340
This virus-like particle

1845
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:51,680
It is the so-called Virus-like particle

1846
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,520
Then this particle is similar to the human breast map virus we saw

1847
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,960
Actually looks very similar

1848
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,360
much like a virus

1849
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,860
It's hollow inside

1850
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
It has no virus genes in it

1851
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
so look alike

1852
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
very similar

1853
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
That can trigger this Yuwen's antibody

1854
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
So from this human five poisonous virus

1855
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
After the manufacturer produced two kinds of this vaccine

1856
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
it started in 2006

1857
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Just register in every country in the world

1858
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Then introduce the countries of the world

1859
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Already more than 100 countries

1860
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
introduced this registry

1861
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
is registered with this human

1862
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
This human travel vaccine can be vaccinated

1863
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
virus vaccine

1864
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Started in 2012

1865
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Human journey virus vaccine has entered

1866
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
At least 40 countries claim

1867
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
They're going to do the national girl's

1868
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
There are even boys

1869
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Like the United States, there are also boys

1870
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It is to register the human journey vaccine

1871
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
and comprehensive

1872
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
The Human Journey Vaccine Viruses of All Countries

1873
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
the virus vaccine

1874
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,500
They are all aimed at young girls as the first and most important object

1875
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,000
Therefore, you can play if you are over eight or nine years old.

1876
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Most of them were played in the senior year of elementary school or

1877
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,500
Especially in the first year of junior high school

1878
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,000
is three years old

1879
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
girls aged three to fifteen

1880
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,000
Then this vaccine is relatively

1881
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,500
It is much more expensive than Bixing hepatitis vaccine

1882
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,500
But it's really expensive after three doses

1883
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,500
Still not as expensive as those antiviral drugs

1884
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,500
Because it ends after three doses

1885
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,500
Some vaccines are even being promoted now

1886
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,500
Is it okay to take two doses?

1887
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
because in poorer countries it feels

1888
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,500
it's still too expensive

1889
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,500
But a small number of low-income countries

1890
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:45,500
Like not only poor countries like Rwanda

1891
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:49,500
After they accept donations from other countries

1892
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,500
It can be introduced in 2010 and 2011 respectively

1893
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,500
Human Journey Virus Vaccines in Adolescents

1894
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,500
Start doing this injection in their country

1895
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,600
Because we all know that low-income countries actually have higher

1896
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,240
This vaccine should be given to poor countries

1897
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:09,440
But these 40 countries are actually relatively rich countries

1898
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:15,440
How long can it protect after these hits?

1899
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,160
Even if we were actually just a moment later we'll mention

1900
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,160
How long will this vaccine protect us?

1901
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,040
After playing, do I need to add more or what?

1902
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,840
It is more troublesome to add

1903
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:31,440
Evidence as far as we know because it has not been introduced as long as liver B

1904
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,840
So the antibodies produced by the two vaccines

1905
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,240
Immunity to this type 16 and type 18

1906
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,000
Probably L1 has more antibodies to test its antibodies

1907
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,040
and for this precancerous lesion

1908
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,360
Because uterine cancer is easier to study these precancerous lesions

1909
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,720
Its speed is faster and you can see whether it exists or not earlier.

1910
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,320
Probably can last for at least 9.4 years

1911
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,320
So about 10 years or so

1912
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
What about privately priced vaccines?

1913
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,720
Presumably his research also saw presumably can maintain the latest reports

1914
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:05,920
But he can last about eight years or more

1915
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:10,160
So probably I think maybe ten years should be no problem

1916
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,760
That doesn't mean there will be problems if it's more than ten years old.

1917
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,960
but no evidence

1918
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:16,080
just don't know yet

1919
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:20,080
But of course it will become apparent after a little more time

1920
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,080
so what

1921
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,160
what is the future outlook

1922
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,760
We see this under-resourced place

1923
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,440
We think he should ask him to help everyone to help him

1924
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,200
So if there are some people who are not vaccinated

1925
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,960
We want to persuade him to get vaccinated

1926
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,400
because some anti-vaccine groups

1927
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,280
The vaccine failure is the most serious

1928
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,080
We in Taiwan should work hard to overcome this problem

1929
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,920
How long can the long-term protection last?

1930
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,960
That's what we should know

1931
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,760
The current recommendation is to say

1932
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,480
prophylaxis against hepatitis B

1933
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,880
Do you want to add it?

1934
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,480
actually don't need

1935
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,880
for at least twenty years

1936
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
From our current evidence it appears that

1937
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
and the recommendations of the World Health Organization

1938
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,000
So now Taiwan is facing the biggest problem

1939
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
What to do to prevent registration failure

1940
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Of course, the mother's high viral load is the biggest reason

1941
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Maternal high viral load especially anti-antigen positive

1942
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
mother who is also antigen positive

1943
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Intrauterine Infection Conditions

1944
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
The second is that viruses are also very smart

1945
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
it may produce some antiviral some

1946
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
against this mutant strain of immunity

1947
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Then let the virus survive

1948
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
The third factor is the prime group

1949
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
It is actually immune insufficiency

1950
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
or it has some immunosuppressants

1951
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
or its genetic response to these vaccines

1952
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
no way to produce antibodies

1953
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
then the problem arises

1954
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Intrauterine infection in our past study

1955
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
665 mothers

1956
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Antigen positive mother

1957
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
About 2.4% of her children

1958
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Her baby was born on the first day of life

1959
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Liver face antigen positive status

1960
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,200
And we tracked them for 12 months and found that they all became chronic and distant

1961
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,000
So this is called an intrauterine infection

1962
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:12,000
In our other study, we studied about 583 children.

1963
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
What if his mother is anti-antigen positive and the mother with the highest risk of surface antigen-positive

1964
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:25,000
We found that 9.26% of them, about 9 to 10 percent, became chronically infected.

1965
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
What about if the mother is anti-antigen positive and has the second highest infection status?

1966
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Then his child probably didn't get immunoglobulin, about 0.29%

1967
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Then if immunoglobulin is administered, 0.14% is much worse than 0.29 and 9.26.

1968
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So we know that this group is the object of our greatest efforts in the future.

1969
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
It is the mothers of the high-risk group who are positive for S antigen and positive for S antigen

1970
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
We must keep his children from getting infected

1971
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
So, in this group of mothers, the S antigen-positive children probably have

1972
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,500
10% will prevent injection failure

1973
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,600
If it is anti-antigen negative

1974
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,000
S antigen positive child with original mother

1975
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,800
Less than 1% of his prophylaxis failures

1976
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,900
But of course he also has the chance to become

1977
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:15,500
Acute or fulminant hepatitis condition

1978
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,000
also pay attention

1979
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,500
So we did a prospective study

1980
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,500
mothers of the highest risk group

1981
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,300
when he was pregnant

1982
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:24,900
The amount of virus in the blood

1983
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,800
Come test him and find out

1984
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,000
80% of them

1985
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:30,600
very high viral load

1986
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,600
From the 6th power of 10 to the 9th power of 10 or more

1987
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,800
very very high viral load

1988
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,900
In contrast, if it is the second highest risk group

1989
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,600
Antigen Negative

1990
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,900
But the words of mothers who are positive for S antigen

1991
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,700
Only 0.5%

1992
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:46,900
His viral load is around 6 to 8 powers

1993
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,700
So if we look at the picture on the right

1994
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:50,700
You will find that the horizontal axis is

1995
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:53,100
viral load during pregnancy

1996
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,400
what about his child

1997
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,900
Is there any performance when the belt is originally the center axis?

1998
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:58,900
prophylaxis failure rate

1999
01:24:58,900 --> 01:24:59,900
will find out that

2000
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,700
If the mother's viral load is higher in these children

2001
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,860
The higher the percentage of her failure

2002
01:25:04,860 --> 01:25:06,460
even from one to nine powers

2003
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,140
Possibly 30% of children could be vaccinated

2004
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,660
Everything is a failure

2005
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:13,240
So it's very dangerous for these kids

2006
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,500
So our suggestion is to say

2007
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:17,540
All pregnant women should have

2008
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:20,140
when you're 12 weeks pregnant

2009
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:23,840
should be tested for hepatitis B markers

2010
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,300
All babies should be within 24 hours

2011
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:28,600
go for vaccinations

2012
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,140
when she was born

2013
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,640
30 days old

2014
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,840
180 days old in August

2015
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,840
Going to get three full seasons of vaccinations

2016
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,600
And as suggested by Professor B Death

2017
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,740
they should be in

2018
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,840
Children of mothers with anti-antigen positive

2019
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,400
should be within 24 hours

2020
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,740
must be the sooner the better

2021
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,200
receive immunizations for Danish injections

2022
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,740
Of course, what we hope most is to reduce the

2023
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:53,940
The amount of HBV in these pregnant women

2024
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:54,740
how to do it

2025
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:57,600
We are currently conducting clinical trials

2026
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,700
It was during the third period

2027
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,700
can be slower

2028
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,640
Mom takes antiviral drugs

2029
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,340
and let mom's viral load go down

2030
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,140
Our preliminary results show that it is effective

2031
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:11,840
It is true that the infection rate of these children has dropped

2032
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,740
So we say against hepatitis B and other related

2033
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,540
These liver words related to him

2034
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:20,640
We should stop mother-to-child transmission

2035
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:22,080
And the blocking of this infection

2036
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:26,700
It should start from the fetus and from the neonatal period

2037
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:30,900
This is where we very much hope to be able to do well in the future

2038
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:34,900
Of course, other anti-cancer vaccines have also been developed

2039
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,540
For example, in addition to the above two

2040
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:41,540
In addition to uterine cancer and liver cancer that have been vaccinated

2041
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,900
Like hepatitis virus and liver cancer

2042
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,640
pyloric helix sensitivity

2043
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,500
with this stomach cancer and

2044
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,700
Ibe virus and lymphoma and BMI

2045
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,240
And herpes virus type 8 and capuchin

2046
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:55,540
human T cell leukemia virus

2047
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:57,440
adult T cell leukemia

2048
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,040
So many patients generate so many new patients every year

2049
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,600
no vaccine yet

2050
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,000
So we should work harder to

2051
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
to develop these new vaccines

2052
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
So in the end I'm going to tell you

2053
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
talk about future prospects

2054
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
What about the development of new vaccines in the future?

2055
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
hope to find out

2056
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
if research can find it

2057
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
protective antibodies

2058
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
where is its antigen

2059
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
That can be done like hepatitis B

2060
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Or something like a human milk-coated vaccine

2061
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
can make a good vaccine

2062
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
This is the most ideal

2063
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
target antigen

2064
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And then after making it

2065
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
who

2066
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Like a baby or

2067
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Which one is the student?

2068
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Is it him or a girl or a boy

2069
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,000
is his top priority

2070
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
It is targeted for injection of vaccine

2071
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
that for existing

2072
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
What about hepatitis B and human milk vaccines?

2073
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
We're going to enhance its injection

2074
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
vaccination rate

2075
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Then we're going to work hard to overcome this

2076
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Failed vaccination

2077
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,080
situation, we're going to have to dig deeper into this whole vaccine

2078
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,440
How long can protect us, if possible

2079
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,560
Of course it is to make better vaccines, especially human reapplying vaccines

2080
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:15,600
This picture shows that in fact, it has been developing new

2081
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:22,200
Better vaccines, for example, this is the nine vaccines

2082
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:26,600
It's not just this place, it's 16 and 18, it can cover everything

2083
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,840
At present, Taiwan also has a relatively large number of 52 and 58 types.

2084
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,960
This kind of human catch-up vaccine

2085
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,720
So it is possible to add L2 and L1 together

2086
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,920
These are new developments

2087
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,080
so i think we'll just end here

2088
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,000
That is to say, blocking the vaccine is not a dream

2089
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,840
I want to get in the way we have to start at an early age

2090
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:57,200
Here I would like to thank me for helping some of my colleagues

2091
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,900
And thank you all for being here today

2092
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,900
Thank you all for joining our set of discussions

2093
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,500
We are very grateful to Academician Zhang

2094
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:16,700
Professor Zhang gave us this wonderful speech

2095
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:20,500
So we have about 20 minutes to 30 minutes now

2096
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,600
Can Q&A

2097
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,600
If you have a problem, please raise your hand

2098
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,600
Then press the green place here

2099
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,800
Then introduce yourself briefly

2100
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,100
ask more questions please

2101
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,200
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

2102
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:32,900
and very clear

2103
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,300
I work in a law firm

2104
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,000
I often come here to give speeches occasionally when I have time.

2105
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,900
what i want to ask is

2106
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,000
you just told us

2107
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,600
The United States has not yet tested for transplanted antigens

2108
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,000
then also tell us

2109
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,100
japanese while they are watching mother

2110
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:50,500
It is only important to see that the surface antigen is positive

2111
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,200
However, the last part of the data shows that

2112
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,000
Antigen transfer is actually super important

2113
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,500
can you tell us

2114
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,900
these two countries

2115
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,100
their academics or their medical profession

2116
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Why do you think you don't need to deal with inhibitors?

2117
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:03,500
just ok

2118
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:05,000
Thank you for this very good question

2119
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
That is to say, the source of inhibitor is very important

2120
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
But what do they do in the United States?

2121
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Because America they are rich

2122
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
So they are making all mothers S-antigens

2123
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
surface antigen

2124
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Then he gave him immunoglobulin

2125
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
So he spends more money

2126
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
What about the government of Taiwan?

2127
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
He spent the money to test for inhibitors

2128
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
But he said that the negative source of inhibitor is actually better than

2129
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Inhibitors are more positive

2130
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
He won't give him immune globulin

2131
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
He just saves money on the immunoglobulin.

2132
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Well, we are actually in the Ministry of Health and Welfare

2133
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
CDC

2134
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Later there were some discussions

2135
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
That is to say, we should learn

2136
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
The US or we should maintain the status quo in Taiwan

2137
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Then our final conclusion is that

2138
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Because our research proves

2139
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Antigen negative mother

2140
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Actually only 0.14 to 0.29%

2141
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
contagious to his children

2142
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
10% of the inhibitor positive

2143
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,380
Plus, if we're really going to treat these pregnant women in the future

2144
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:09,140
If these pregnant women really want to take medicine

2145
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:10,940
We still need anti-inflammatory medicine

2146
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:13,320
It’s like going to the doctor’s anti-inflammation and then screening for high-level viruses

2147
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:18,380
So the final decision is that we don't want to learn from the United States

2148
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:21,660
Then we'll save the immunoglobulin money.

2149
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:24,700
Then go, but spend the money of the screening doctor and anti-inflammation

2150
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,060
What about Japan? Japan has always

2151
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:29,560
They actually started vaccinations very early.

2152
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,260
But in Japan they always feel that their hepatitis B

2153
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:34,760
not they are not their most important problem

2154
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:37,960
Most of them have hepatitis C

2155
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,560
Hepatitis C is more common in Japan

2156
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:45,700
And they think it's the most important to hit these high-risk groups

2157
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,800
But their pediatrician

2158
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,740
And their hepatologist keeps telling me

2159
01:31:49,740 --> 01:31:51,300
they have been convincing the government

2160
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:53,440
Even the government has been making new vaccines

2161
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,640
But this part was finally convinced

2162
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:00,140
Now Japan is also starting to do this kind of depression for the whole people

2163
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So it means they still have approval

2164
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Does that one have a problem and wants to ask for leave?

2165
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
come please

2166
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
thank you for your very important question

2167
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Hepatitis is ABCDE

2168
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
There are currently five

2169
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Among them, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E are Chrysostomy

2170
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Just eat something and pass it in

2171
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Chrysostom's is what we call fecal-oral infection

2172
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
contaminated food

2173
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
and eat it in the stomach

2174
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
That's fecal-oral infection

2175
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
BCDEs are bodily fluid and blood infections

2176
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
So it's a dirty needle

2177
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
or blood or sexually transmitted

2178
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Probably some contagious stunt like this

2179
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Okay, I don't know if there is any problem to ask for leave.

2180
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,700
Professor Zhang made it very clear today

2181
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,000
Put the whole vaccination

2182
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,600
Cancer prevention is very in-depth and rolled out

2183
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,700
come here please

2184
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,700
ask now

2185
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:15,500
Anti-cancer vaccine against Helicobacter eubacterium

2186
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,800
how is the development

2187
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,800
Helicobacter eubacterium

2188
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,200
In fact, many scholars want to make vaccines

2189
01:33:22,700 --> 01:33:26,900
But the current development seems to be not going well

2190
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:34,100
That is because maybe its really protective antigen

2191
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:37,700
Protective antibodies are actually not so clear

2192
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,800
But there are many studies

2193
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:42,000
In addition, because of its therapeutic drug

2194
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,200
was quite successful

2195
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:48,200
So it seems that the current trend is to take medicine

2196
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:52,900
to give medicine to those who have already got the infection

2197
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:58,100
Of course we hope that one day there will be a good vaccine

2198
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,700
Of course you say the whole virus will go down

2199
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,500
Can the bacteria go down?

2200
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,900
At present, there seems to be no way to make an ideal vaccine

2201
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:09,400
please

2202
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,400
ask the professor

2203
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,500
Just now you mentioned that

2204
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,800
Anyone under the age of 30 is vaccinated

2205
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:21,300
Then do you recommend those over 30 years old who haven’t played before?

2206
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,900
Hurry up and get this vaccine now

2207
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:24,500
Thanks

2208
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:29,200
That is to say, what we have seen from past research

2209
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:30,800
Infection in Taiwan is actually

2210
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,600
From just now we see a line

2211
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,100
Just haven't had the vaccination yet

2212
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,600
Flattened after two years of age

2213
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,100
Said that the infection in Taiwan

2214
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:42,700
is the majority before the age of two

2215
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:45,000
So it doesn't mean that it won't be contagious when you grow up

2216
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,800
because

2217
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,200
Because some steam heads were not clean in the past

2218
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,000
That's some clinic

2219
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,300
He didn't have disinfection or dental check in the early days

2220
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:56,000
But now it's been very well disinfected.

2221
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,500
So what about people over 30?

2222
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,000
People over the age of 30 can go

2223
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Test markers to see if you are negative for all three

2224
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,000
If negative for surface antigen Negative for surface antibody

2225
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Then if the core antibody is negative, it is likely that you have not had it

2226
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:16,000
This kind of person is very rare, so this kind of person can be vaccinated

2227
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
If the core antibody, the easiest way for us to screen with a marker is the core antibody

2228
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
If the core antibody is positive, probably all will pass

2229
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
come please

2230
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Professor, Professor, how does hepatitis turn into liver cancer?

2231
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Great question, but a disaster

2232
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Both are great questions. How does hepatitis turn into liver cancer?

2233
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
We've all studied all our lives and are still finding the answers.

2234
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
But in short it should be

2235
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It is a trilogy of walking a bit like holding on to shoes

2236
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
That is to say it is hepatitis

2237
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,600
hepatitis then cirrhosis

2238
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,920
Then the liver comes and goes like this

2239
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,440
But it's not 100%, right?

2240
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,800
we just saw eighty percent

2241
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,360
It seems to be going this way

2242
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,680
In other words, inflammation first

2243
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:15,360
Then after inflammation, cell necrosis

2244
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,480
After necrosis, cells want to regenerate

2245
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,920
because we have some tissue damage

2246
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,320
For example, we have wounds on our bodies

2247
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,080
we just want to regenerate it

2248
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:26,640
Then our body already has a regeneration mechanism

2249
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:29,680
But when it needs to regenerate in the liver?

2250
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,840
will launch the wrong message

2251
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,120
That is to say, some of what we call liver cells

2252
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:37,440
there are some cells it's coming out

2253
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,600
When the injury is too serious

2254
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,680
activates liver cells

2255
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:45,120
there are some cells it regenerates excessively

2256
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,440
becomes a carcinogenic phenomenon

2257
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:49,040
it doesn't know when to stop

2258
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,400
just keep walking

2259
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,920
that becomes a condition like cancer

2260
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,200
So the current theory is that

2261
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,960
inflamed

2262
01:36:58,960 --> 01:36:59,920
then hurt

2263
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,020
and then regenerate after possible damage

2264
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:06,620
Then something wrong happened with regeneration

2265
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,420
Rebirth should be just after birth

2266
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:10,620
about to stop

2267
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,580
The result is non-stop life can not stop

2268
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:15,220
become albinism

2269
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:16,420
just keep growing

2270
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,720
ok come here

2271
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,060
Then wait a moment for the classmate in black at the back

2272
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:23,720
Come

2273
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,420
Changjiang is smart

2274
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:26,620
i want to ask a question

2275
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:29,920
It is written on the slide behind you just now

2276
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,320
speak mother's words

2277
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,320
inhibitor antigen or s antigen

2278
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:36,120
that very high words

2279
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,020
That vaccination is prone to failure

2280
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,460
that's probably because

2281
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,820
That is, the mother already has

2282
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:44,620
Antibodies against anti-antigen and s-antigen

2283
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:47,020
Then to synthesize the subsequent vaccines

2284
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:51,260
Because your vaccine came from the s antigen after all

2285
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:54,320
yes this is

2286
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,420
mothers with s antigen positive

2287
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,980
she would not have

2288
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,640
Measured Not absolute

2289
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:06,200
But most of them are undetectable antibody S antibody

2290
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:10,200
How should I put it, in fact, if you understand our clinical laboratory

2291
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,280
doing antigen-antibody reaction

2292
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,040
You'll find out that it actually has a cut value

2293
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,760
That is to say, I measured out a bunch of values

2294
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,800
But this line, after drawing a line

2295
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:21,720
Above this line is called positive

2296
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,640
Below this line is called negative

2297
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:28,920
This is the positive control group after many tests

2298
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,120
This negative control group is the last test to be tested

2299
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,800
If you had a test you would know

2300
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,280
It's actually a very artificial personality.

2301
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:39,520
Then say this is positive and this is negative

2302
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:44,800
Then this S antigen-positive mother has a lot of S antigens

2303
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,880
So almost when you have S antigen all over your body

2304
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,360
His body may produce a little S antibody, and he will be poisoned immediately

2305
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,560
So there's never a way in your blood

2306
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,360
S antibodies are almost always undetectable

2307
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,400
but there is a force

2308
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
In addition, the mutant strain of S just mentioned

2309
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:11,000
People with S mutants sometimes still have antibodies and antigens at the same time

2310
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
That's its antigen, that's the mutant

2311
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Its antibody is an antibody against the wild strain

2312
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
two different antibodies

2313
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
This is too complicated so let's not talk about it

2314
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
The other one is E antigen and E antibody

2315
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
You also mentioned the E antigen

2316
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,000
E antigen E antibody we often say when we look at patient information

2317
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Why is this person positive for E antigen? Positive? Positive. One day the E antigen will disappear.

2318
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
But he didn't develop antibodies

2319
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Then finally one day he developed antibodies

2320
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Or this guy is E antigen positive Positive Positive

2321
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
When the result is positive

2322
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
It's strange that his antibody is also positive

2323
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
It becomes E antigen positive and positive at the same time

2324
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
E antigen negative and negative presence

2325
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
This is a transitional period

2326
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,000
he won't be like this forever

2327
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:00,000
It means that when the E antigen of this person is gradually decreasing

2328
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,600
He may have the ability to have antibodies that surpass him

2329
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,500
So he was withdrawn to

2330
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,000
But this situation is two fighting

2331
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,500
Is it the virus that wins or the human race?

2332
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,000
Wait until the day when humans win

2333
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
He suppressed the antibody and came out

2334
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,500
Antibodies are gone forever

2335
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:21,000
But in this inhibitor positive mother

2336
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,300
The comparison between positive and negative inhibitory elements will change

2337
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:24,300
some pregnant women

2338
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:27,500
He was anti-antibody positive in the previous life of the production

2339
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Postpartum he cleared some of the virus

2340
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,500
So he later had a postpartum

2341
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,500
Due to hormonal changes

2342
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,500
inhibitory antibody

2343
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:39,500
But it shouldn't be in the scope of our discussion today

2344
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:42,500
Because we're talking about this pregnancy period

2345
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,500
this contagious condition

2346
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,500
Thanks

2347
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,500
There is another classmate here who wears a substitute

2348
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:53,500
Then I'm half a high school student now

2349
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:56,500
There are stories that have been learned before

2350
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,500
Inger had that kind of AFA in her pregnancy

2351
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:11,000
He has some preexisting genetic disease or certain mutations that could be linked

2352
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I don’t know if there will be some connection with the high amount of genetic antigen and S antigen in the mother’s body

2353
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Could that be why one of the injections failed?

2354
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:32,000
He knows that this fetal protein is very hard work

2355
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,000
In fact, it is a coincidence that fetal protein is the marker of human liver cancer

2356
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
It means that I just mentioned how this cancer can be detected

2357
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
How can fetal protein be detected in liver cancer

2358
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Fetal protein should be present in the fetus

2359
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Then after birth for 12 months he will slowly decline

2360
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,000
We've done research with our children in the past

2361
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
We have to measure the rate of decline of fetal protein

2362
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,760
Found to about 12 months

2363
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:04,800
Fetal protein returns to normal

2364
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,900
The normal value is about 10

2365
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:09,840
It used to be Chedai 20 Narogram per amyl

2366
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:11,500
blood that can be thinned

2367
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,900
Now it is cut to 10 Narogram per amyl

2368
01:42:14,900 --> 01:42:19,900
It means that when the fetus is 12 months old, there will be a very high amount from the fetus

2369
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,900
Fetal protein is very high at birth

2370
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:24,400
higher in utero

2371
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,400
It represents these stem cells

2372
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,500
In fact, these stem cells that produce fetal protein

2373
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:35,000
It was actually very tall in the mother's womb

2374
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:35,900
very vigorous

2375
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:39,800
These hepatoblasts actually have many conditions

2376
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:43,700
But it is born in the baby's 12 months

2377
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:45,700
All have been declining during the first year

2378
01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:47,100
so it shouldn't be high

2379
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,700
So if an adult suddenly detects high levels of fetal protein

2380
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:52,200
I said, do you have liver cancer?

2381
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,800
That's why it's called a marker for liver cancer screening.

2382
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,100
just asked a very important question

2383
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:00,000
Then what you mentioned just now is about the fetal protein

2384
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Rising with this mom this brooder

2385
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,760
Is it related to the failure of the injection in the fetal area?

2386
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,800
In fact, we have never studied such a project

2387
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,960
there is no way to say

2388
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,160
what kind of relationship will there be between them

2389
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:17,160
because it is essentially

2390
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:20,360
Mother because of the placenta of our human mothers

2391
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:22,760
Yes should be a very good barrier

2392
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:24,760
After all, the liver virus passed

2393
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:26,840
unless the placenta has a hole

2394
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,120
That course our para-obstetrician studies

2395
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,680
Sometimes the placenta has holes

2396
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:32,560
go to it

2397
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,760
It's called the feeling of the womb

2398
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:36,720
So currently I have no way to figure out

2399
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,760
When fetal protein is in the baby's womb

2400
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,560
what would it have to do with this

2401
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,520
here is another problem

2402
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,560
then behind

2403
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:55,640
that is, if the parents have that

2404
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:59,000
the one with chronic hepatitis

2405
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,040
words of hepatitis

2406
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It is easy to destroy the liver liver to children

2407
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Then can we do that pre-marital health check?

2408
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Go find out if that parent is one of them has chronic hepatitis Advocate

2409
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
avoid having small children if at all

2410
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
as a pediatrician

2411
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Of course I don't want people not to have children.

2412
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Otherwise we would have no patients to see

2413
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
In fact, it's more important not for us small doctors

2414
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Actually for our country

2415
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
The people are the masters of the country

2416
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
So we have been promoting everyone to have more children

2417
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It's best to have four or five, or even ten.

2418
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
So it's definitely not a reason not to have children

2419
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
And that means there is a way, it can be prevented by vaccines

2420
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Even if we block in the future

2421
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Premarital checkup is of course very good

2422
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
That is to say, pre-marital examination

2423
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
We now have some young parents who are already doing pre-marital checkups

2424
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
We know mothers are actually the biggest

2425
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Is the father infected?

2426
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
There are also father-son infections, but there are more

2427
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
mother is the most important

2428
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
the mother or father to infect

2429
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Actually there is another

2430
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
we do wedding checks

2431
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
there is another meaning

2432
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Just don't want husband and wife to infect each other

2433
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
So if a couple

2434
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
like boyfriend and girlfriend

2435
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
If they go for a check-up before they get married

2436
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
the side the side that doesn't

2437
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Should get vaccinated

2438
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,000
This should be

2439
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
This is to prevent husband and wife from infecting each other

2440
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
It is more important to prevent couples

2441
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Then go on, of course, just watch

2442
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Can the mother infect the child?

2443
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
this is another

2444
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
We also don't want couples to infect each other

2445
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
but have to have a baby

2446
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
ok this side

2447
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
lady please

2448
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,000
about the treatment of the pregnant woman

2449
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
this part of hepatitis

2450
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Because the professor just mentioned

2451
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
then i want to ask

2452
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
if during pregnancy

2453
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
taking medicine

2454
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,560
Will it affect the development of the fetus?

2455
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,100
This is the first question

2456
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,640
The second question is

2457
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,940
You have written 28 weeks above

2458
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:10,240
what is the consideration

2459
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:11,260
Thanks

2460
01:46:11,260 --> 01:46:13,820
In fact, this is a very, very important question

2461
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:15,360
that's what we do

2462
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,660
When I started designing this clinical trial

2463
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:21,500
In fact, we all get nervous when doing clinical trials.

2464
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:22,780
just in case

2465
01:46:22,780 --> 01:46:24,580
what i did with this pregnant woman

2466
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:26,380
What kind of side effects did it really have?

2467
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,160
I'd feel bad conscience

2468
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:33,020
If trying to save him ends up hindering him, wouldn't that be bad?

2469
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:36,860
So we have to refer to AIDS research

2470
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:41,720
AIDS, because they are ahead of us, they have done a lot of treatment for pregnant women

2471
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:45,560
So we went to see because this drug happens to be a drug that can be used for AIDS

2472
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:47,880
So there are some

2473
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,920
It is the login of the congenital model

2474
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,000
Then find their login details found

2475
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,760
actually

2476
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,060
Congenital models did not increase at all

2477
01:46:56,060 --> 01:46:57,340
and

2478
01:46:57,340 --> 01:47:00,160
The base value is as much so we just

2479
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,520
dare to go down and do it

2480
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:02,800
This is the first reason

2481
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,200
The second is to say this 28 weeks

2482
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:08,700
you are very careful noticing

2483
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:11,560
This 28 week thing is very, very good

2484
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,200
That is to say, 28 weeks

2485
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,700
Mainly because of fear

2486
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:18,200
That is to say, at the time of the third generation

2487
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,560
We think the fetus is already formed

2488
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,100
So in case there is any deformity

2489
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:26,460
I won't be blamed by my parents

2490
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,800
Although in fact we know very well

2491
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:29,560
it's not because of this to cause

2492
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,760
But it's hard for you to tell your parents

2493
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:32,660
Is this going to

2494
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:35,960
it still blames you for saying maybe

2495
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:38,760
So 28 weeks has it's benefits which is to say

2496
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:39,320
I told him

2497
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:42,320
You can see the shapes born in the early stage

2498
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:45,120
So 28 weeks is pretty safe

2499
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:47,120
So on the one hand it is the tertiary

2500
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,260
In fact, there are some predecessors

2501
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:50,860
drugs have been done

2502
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:53,420
So we think there is no problem

2503
01:47:53,420 --> 01:47:54,920
So of course this medicine is useful?

2504
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:57,660
Because it is pregnant there are ABCD categories

2505
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:00,020
In the past, some people used a series of medicines

2506
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,760
did a little experiment

2507
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:04,460
Looks like it works too

2508
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:06,060
Then the drug we chose is category B.

2509
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:08,400
Of course it is safer than class C

2510
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:09,560
Type A vitamins

2511
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,260
Pregnant women in this category can eat

2512
01:48:11,260 --> 01:48:12,760
So it should be safe

2513
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:15,500
Come on, there's a problem later

2514
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:18,500
I don't want to ask Professor Zhang a question

2515
01:48:18,500 --> 01:48:21,060
That is, after listening to the speech just now

2516
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:24,860
It seems that hepatitis B and C are the cause of hepatitis

2517
01:48:24,860 --> 01:48:25,960
The main reason

2518
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:29,360
Is that someone who doesn't have any hepatitis?

2519
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:30,960
won't get liver cancer

2520
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,960
it's also a good

2521
01:48:33,960 --> 01:48:36,560
Scholars around the world are currently studying

2522
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,560
The answer is of course no

2523
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,360
That is to say, if we take the world's

2524
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,920
B liver is taken away

2525
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:45,360
Do humans not have liver cancer?

2526
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,160
The answer is of course no

2527
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,220
there will still be

2528
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:51,760
but it will be less

2529
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:52,920
will be much less

2530
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,480
Because liver B occupies a large part

2531
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:57,080
that's us

2532
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:58,160
For example, our children

2533
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,280
there is another liver

2534
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,160
Liver model

2535
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
stem cells

2536
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Stem blasts are similar to liver cancer

2537
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
it is an innate stem cell

2538
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
embryonic cell cancer

2539
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
then becomes

2540
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
that's another

2541
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
sometimes it gets to the teens

2542
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
But adults don't have this disease

2543
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Adults don't have this disease

2544
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
but adults it will have some fat

2545
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
lesion

2546
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
some western countries

2547
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
They have less liver B or C

2548
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
But they still have liver cancer

2549
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
We call non-non-B type

2550
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
this liver cancer

2551
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
but much less

2552
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Hello, little professor, I am

2553
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Chen Jianmin

2554
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
I appreciate your great speech

2555
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I have a question

2556
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
If it is a vaccine for the general public to avoid liver

2557
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Prevented 90% of childhood infections

2558
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Then

2559
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
that is

2560
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Hepatocellular carcinoma in children

2561
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
finally possible

2562
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
The above are caused by infection

2563
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Then why is it that the whole people can't beat the email?

2564
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
It is reduced to 90%, reduced to 70%

2565
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
That's a great question, that's what I keep asking myself

2566
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Question Asked I've been asking this question myself

2567
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
your question is very good

2568
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
We often talk about the 90% and 70%

2569
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
In fact, I deliberately wrote 90% and 70% for everyone to see.

2570
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
90% and 70% are 20% different

2571
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
How did the 20% come about?

2572
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Why can't he become

2573
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
There is nothing you can do to prevent this

2574
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
so we were thinking

2575
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
These 10% of people are the people who failed the vaccination

2576
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
My hypothesis is that

2577
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:51,000
These people develop infections at a higher rate than others

2578
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Why because he failed his vaccination

2579
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Indicates that his mother's virus is very high

2580
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
so his mom gave him the worst virus

2581
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
lots of viruses

2582
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:04,740
It is likely that his entire liver disease process

2583
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:06,740
is more serious

2584
01:51:06,740 --> 01:51:08,740
We probably can't do it right now

2585
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:10,740
really to prove him

2586
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:11,740
I can probably do it now

2587
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:13,740
Which means I'm going to track down these kids.

2588
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:15,240
Then I was watching his virus

2589
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:17,240
I'm working on his natural virus right now

2590
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,240
Is it more serious

2591
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,240
then his whole this

2592
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:22,240
Currently we have a little preliminary

2593
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,740
The result is probably to see these

2594
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:26,240
after vaccination

2595
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,740
failed kid

2596
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:29,240
as if his whole

2597
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,240
The course of the disease will be prolonged

2598
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,240
Compare

2599
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,240
The whole course will be longer

2600
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:37,240
Then the period of immunity will be longer

2601
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,240
everyone see here

2602
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,240
I don't have a way to fully answer this question yet

2603
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,240
But thank you for the question

2604
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:44,240
actually a very

2605
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,240
I think college students can ask questions like

2606
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:47,240
I admire it very much

2607
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,240
I probably didn't when I was in college

2608
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:51,240
incapable of asking such questions

2609
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,240
sir please

2610
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:55,240
i want to ask two questions

2611
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:57,240
The first is to often hear people say

2612
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:00,240
in everyone's body

2613
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,700
have cancer cells

2614
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,900
right this time

2615
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:04,900
How does the second cancer cell arise

2616
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,900
This is also a big question

2617
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:09,900
possible

2618
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:11,900
I think it's possible to reach a certain age

2619
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:13,900
Yes, there are really cancer cells in the body

2620
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:14,900
I believe

2621
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:15,900
but this

2622
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,900
this has very good questions

2623
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:19,900
So it takes a lot of scientists

2624
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,900
Let's answer this question together

2625
01:52:21,900 --> 01:52:24,900
But our body has a very good immune system

2626
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:25,900
it can put that

2627
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:27,900
If you just had these bad cells

2628
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:28,900
you just put it

2629
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,900
let it shrink

2630
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:31,900
let it die

2631
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:32,900
so what

2632
01:52:32,900 --> 01:52:34,900
it won't keep reproducing

2633
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:36,900
So this is one that our human body inherently has

2634
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,900
Protect our own muscle mass

2635
01:52:38,900 --> 01:52:40,900
so this is a

2636
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:41,900
human body

2637
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:42,900
nice this

2638
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:45,900
A natural immune system against cancer

2639
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,900
come kill it

2640
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:49,900
it naturally stops growing

2641
01:52:49,900 --> 01:52:51,900
But if you provide

2642
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:52,900
very good microenvironment

2643
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:54,900
let it be in this microenvironment

2644
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:57,900
have a good immune system

2645
01:52:57,900 --> 01:52:59,900
support its continued growth

2646
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,460
good bleeding

2647
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,700
let it grow

2648
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:05,900
Then this cancer will gradually change from a cell to a cluster

2649
01:53:05,900 --> 01:53:08,400
A group becomes 0.5 cm

2650
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,860
Then just 1 cm

2651
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:10,860
growing up

2652
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:13,460
Then it produces a lot of blood vessels

2653
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,960
Then I kept growing up

2654
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:16,960
become an itchy and fatter

2655
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:18,800
The condition that gets more and more itchy

2656
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,960
beat us

2657
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:23,560
good

2658
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:24,360
Come

2659
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:26,500
this classmate

2660
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:28,460
Then come see this gentleman again

2661
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:32,100
Hello Professor Zhang

2662
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,100
I'm Xu Yujia

2663
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:34,900
Then I would like to ask about

2664
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:37,900
Because the professor just mentioned that

2665
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:40,300
Nasal and liver vaccines are mainly

2666
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:42,000
Antigens enter the body

2667
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,800
The body then produces antibodies

2668
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:45,500
or part of an immunoglobulin

2669
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:48,200
That's more to do with the immune system

2670
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,300
that's for rhinovirus

2671
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:52,200
That's the way it infects parts

2672
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:54,800
Is there any relevant research on

2673
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,100
Studies have shown that if infected

2674
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:57,400
and then cause some

2675
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,200
eventually cause cancer cells to proliferate

2676
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,200
did that

2677
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
just use some drugs

2678
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,500
or give it some cellular signals

2679
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:06,700
let it achieve cell shedding or something

2680
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:09,700
Prevent the spread or proliferation of cancer

2681
01:54:09,700 --> 01:54:11,200
Is there any research on this

2682
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:11,700
Thanks

2683
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:13,300
Yes, yes, it is the cure for cancer

2684
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:14,300
It's called cancer treatment

2685
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,300
or cancer treatment

2686
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:19,800
In fact, vaccines include anti-cancer vaccines and therapeutic vaccines

2687
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:22,800
and cancer drugs

2688
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,800
Then what you just mentioned is actually

2689
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,600
currently exists

2690
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:28,000
There is a licensed

2691
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:32,000
There is a drug that treats stem cancer

2692
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,500
Then it is a cell that allows

2693
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,000
effective people it will let the cell blast net

2694
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
then zoom out

2695
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
What a pity

2696
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Its effects are not yet broadly

2697
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
That's pretty limited

2698
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,500
but already exists

2699
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:51,500
So current scientists are studying

2700
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,000
like you said

2701
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,500
better better medicine

2702
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:57,500
to treat this cancer

2703
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:00,000
Well, this level of it is of course treatment-oriented.

2704
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
this bus

2705
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
A served Mr. and then in the back

2706
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
right

2707
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
right

2708
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
just mentioned symptoms

2709
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,000
In fact, the media often tells us that

2710
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Professor Xu Jinshan

2711
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
his sister

2712
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
The liver is a silent organ

2713
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
so often

2714
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Liver disease is asymptomatic

2715
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
In fact, everyone already has this concept

2716
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Liver really can't speak

2717
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
really no symptoms

2718
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
there is

2719
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
you mentioned itching

2720
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
or

2721
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Some people have jaundice

2722
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
yellow bile

2723
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
allergy

2724
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
This liver may not necessarily be directly related to liver disease.

2725
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
that but

2726
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,760
If you have this jaundice

2727
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:05,040
That's one of the signs of liver disease

2728
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:08,040
There is still itching, part of it is not an allergy

2729
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,540
cholestasis

2730
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:12,740
When this liver cancer blocks the bile duct

2731
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:16,000
Or when the patient becomes violent

2732
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,500
or severe hepatitis

2733
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:19,540
it will turn yellow

2734
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:21,200
Then its bile will stagnate

2735
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,700
It may also itch at that time

2736
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:24,800
or be very tired

2737
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:27,860
If it's just an itchy skin allergy

2738
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:31,600
It shouldn't have much to do with this.

2739
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:36,260
I just said that eating green onions and parsley is easier to get dry A

2740
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:38,260
Yes, as Vice President Chen said

2741
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:40,200
not washed

2742
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,700
Ordinary people say this

2743
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:45,400
Because when we eat green onions and coriander

2744
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:48,160
Many of them are washed and eaten raw.

2745
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:52,100
Then if in the process of cultivation like this

2746
01:56:52,100 --> 01:56:54,660
When you are contaminated with hepatitis A virus

2747
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:56,260
may be infected

2748
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:58,260
There are also such cases abroad

2749
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:00,060
Then if you eat raw corpses

2750
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,240
It is important to wash vegetables when

2751
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:07,640
If you say your green onions and cilantro are cooked

2752
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:09,940
just put it in for a while

2753
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:12,940
That way there's less chance of getting an infection.

2754
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:14,840
Raw food is more

2755
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:19,140
It was also found in Germany a while ago

2756
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:21,440
when eating lettuce

2757
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:25,040
Lettuce Salads Get Infected When They Are Not Washed

2758
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,740
There are many such sleepers in the United States

2759
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:29,000
This is oral infection

2760
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,840
The classmate in red at the back still has his picture

2761
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,340
The classmate in the red dress first

2762
01:57:37,340 --> 01:57:39,640
hello teacher i want to ask two questions

2763
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,840
The first question is about

2764
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:46,740
I just mentioned that there are about three layers of Tumor in HCC

2765
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:49,540
The pronucleus with HBV DNA looks like this

2766
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:53,340
Compared to HBV it is 99.7%

2767
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:57,340
Then I want to ask what is the reason for the difference in the middle like this

2768
01:57:57,340 --> 01:58:00,080
You're talking about DNA pre-entry

2769
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,100
Yes, dragged into the tissue that made it cancerous

2770
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:06,540
part of the DNA b hepatovirus inserts

2771
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:10,860
30% of the population, but 90% of HPV

2772
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:14,400
About seventy percent, three-sixty-sevenths

2773
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,460
then answer this question first

2774
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:20,800
That is to say, after all, viral genes are involved in cancer.

2775
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,600
Is it directly related to the occurrence of cancer?

2776
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,900
Scholars probably have some arguments

2777
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:30,660
That is to say, the DNA is pulled into this place

2778
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:33,060
Which gene is involved in human beings?

2779
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:34,660
as if we are currently

2780
01:58:34,660 --> 01:58:37,360
We've been working on one for years

2781
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,400
one gene on one skewed body

2782
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,860
The gene called RBNY

2783
01:58:41,860 --> 01:58:44,160
It just happened to be from our little friend

2784
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:46,700
His liver cancer tissue and then

2785
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:48,700
After the DNA is pulled in, we go to study

2786
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:51,600
the neighbor next to it

2787
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:53,760
what is this gene

2788
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,460
But what about people from all over the world

2789
01:58:56,520 --> 01:58:57,920
research looks up

2790
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:00,420
drawn in human

2791
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Lung genetics are not fixed

2792
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
It often has pull-ins in different positions

2793
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,000
So there's a cancer relationship between the two

2794
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
not very sure

2795
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
But maybe part of it is related

2796
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Because its ratio is higher

2797
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Then its precancerous lesions are relatively low

2798
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
But it's already started to get involved

2799
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
because it has reverse

2800
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
It can be involved in such AIDS treatment

2801
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
that really early days

2802
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:29,000
It's not that badly infected

2803
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
The damage is not that bad

2804
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
it's 0%

2805
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
So I guess my answer is just this

2806
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
doesn't fully answer your question

2807
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
you may be partially answering

2808
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
come on next classmate please

2809
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
i think one last question

2810
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Thanks for the time

2811
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Now everyone has a great talk

2812
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Today's content is mainly aimed at preventive cancer

2813
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
section on preventive vaccines

2814
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
in the content of the speech

2815
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Actually I mentioned

2816
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Human such as poisonous virus and liver itching

2817
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,560
Viruses may sneak into human DNA

2818
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,340
the closest part of the womb

2819
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:08,300
Sometimes even see the human virus

2820
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:10,940
The part of 1617 will be shown

2821
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:13,980
Then according to my previous knowledge

2822
02:00:13,980 --> 02:00:18,620
There are some research groups that try to treat these manifestations as

2823
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:24,120
The district treats it as our fan art system to attack these things

2824
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:28,520
Then try to make a therapeutic vaccine like this

2825
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:31,680
But the development doesn't seem to be so suitable

2826
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:37,480
So I would like to ask Professor Chang's opinion on the direction of such an attempt

2827
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:40,260
Of course, that is just mentioned if, for example,

2828
02:00:40,260 --> 02:00:42,760
suppress this 16 or 17 performance

2829
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:45,400
Then it's like nothing

2830
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:50,560
So it could also be a form of therapy in reverse.

2831
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:51,500
right

2832
02:00:51,500 --> 02:00:56,340
So I think this scientific research is that it can

2833
02:00:56,360 --> 02:00:59,540
Like I just said Heeyum he had a dream

2834
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:00,540
have a clip up

2835
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,000
He just wanted to say it's okay

2836
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,000
then you do it

2837
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
you will know

2838
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Then

2839
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
and don't give up

2840
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
keep it up

2841
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Very likely

2842
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
maybe you are the one

2843
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
invent new treatments

2844
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
method person

2845
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I think there is hope

2846
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
ok because of time

2847
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
We thank Academician Zhang again

2848
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
very good speech

2849
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
