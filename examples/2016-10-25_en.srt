1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,900
Hmmm.

2
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:40,940
Music

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,500
All right,

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:59,520
join me and clear the thank you for the

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,300
Introduce Academia Sinica to participate

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,140
Our presentation for today's Feast of Knowledge

7
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm here to represent the Central Court

8
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,540
Introducing our speakers today

9
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,380
Today's speaker is Professor Cai Dingping

10
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,940
Currently in Academia Sinica

11
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,780
Director of Applied Science Research Center

12
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,340
Special Review Researcher

13
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,440
He is also a special commentary professor at the Department of Physics, National Taiwan University

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,060
Some of the information you have is very detailed.

15
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,100
Introduction to Professor Cai

16
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,400
I just need to pick a few points

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,040
He is now the chairman of the Taiwan Information Storage Association

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,360
Chairman of the Optoelectronic Society of the Republic of China

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,460
It is also a meeting of the American Physical Society in Taiwan

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:56,060
Meetings of the International Society for Electrical and Electronic Engineering

21
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,400
Meetings of the Optical Society of America

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,420
International Optoelectronic Society

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Meetings of the Society of Engineering

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Meeting of the Academy of Electromagnetic Sciences

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There is also a meeting of the Asia Pacific Academy of Materials Sciences

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And finally, the meeting of the Physical Society of the Republic of China

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So his academic achievement is very high

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then published more than two hundred papers

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
book or other that chapter

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
A total of forty-nine conference papers

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Thirty-nine other technical reports and other papers

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There are 41 domestic and foreign patents

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So the academic achievement is very high

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
has won many awards

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I just cite a few of the most important ones

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
National Science Council's Fifty Scientific Achievement Awards

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There is also the Industry-University Cooperation Award from the Ministry of Education

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the main thing is

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
NSC Contact Research Award twice

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and academic awards from the Ministry of Education

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
it's very rare

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,240
Foundation Research Contact Awards and more

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:09,240
The topic he is talking to us today is

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,960
Very relevant to his research is the

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,560
About Photon New Era

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,840
because we know that in 2015

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,640
Last year was an International Year of Light

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,800
Specially designate this year as the Year of Light

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,040
It's because I want to attract everyone

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,160
Focus on so-called photonics

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,280
light-based technology

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,560
in this new era

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,680
In this new century of ours

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,800
Lots of new camp fun going on

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,960
useful some development

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,680
This is the topic he mainly introduced to us today.

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,480
Chinese is called Photon New Era

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,680
English is Photonics for the New Era

59
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,640
So I thought my introduction

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,080
not too long

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,800
everyone can save time

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,640
Let's listen to Director Cai's wonderful speech

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,280
thank you all we have now applauded

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,040
welcome to our chair today

65
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,240
good night everybody

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,240
It is a great honor to have this opportunity today

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,280
Come to this today's

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
very important report

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
I will give you a brief report

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,120
Thanks also to my colleagues

71
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,680
they helped me choose

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Fortunix for the New Era

73
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,480
title of this speech

74
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,680
I feel very honored

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,680
in the first chamber of the house of representatives

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,120
inside give such a report

77
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,880
Coming to the House of Representatives is already fast

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,640
just over four years passed

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Learned a lot in the past four years

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,840
There are many very, very good and outstanding seniors, experts and scholars in the Chinese language

81
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,120
so if there's anything wrong with my report today

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
Ken please correct me a lot

83
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,960
Then my report today is roughly divided into two parts.

84
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,040
In the first part, let me briefly tell you

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,800
A short story about the 2015 International Year of Light in Taiwan

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,880
about ten minutes

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,800
Then I will report to you some recent stories about optics

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,040
That's because a colleague specifically told me

89
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,360
This talk is not an academic talk is this knowledge sharing

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,840
So it must be maintained without the formula

91
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,080
then tell the story

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,240
This is very difficult for me

93
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,940
because you cut pork every day

94
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,440
Suddenly today came a handful of vegetables for you to cut

95
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
that's weird

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,920
So I started preparing for this talk this morning

97
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,220
ready to just

98
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,720
so sorry

99
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,920
If there is something incomplete, please advise

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,820
The Year of Light 2015

101
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,420
Basically because of the past few years

102
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
I have been back to Taiwan for more than 20 years

103
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,520
this continuous learning

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,720
continuous efforts

105
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,620
I have always believed that science is the way of the old country

106
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,120
It is also the way of the new country

107
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,620
but over the years

108
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,220
Not only are there things in the courtyard

109
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,920
There are many other foreign things outside the hospital

110
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,420
On the contrary, many important things

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's why I want to say that I still use such precious time

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Tell everyone the ins and outs of this whole story

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because a lot of people don't know

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But in fact, this is a very large event that takes place around the world.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
First of all, I would like to thank Chen Boru, a student from Jiangdong University

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There is also a dub that puts this

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
A short video of a whole world to share with you

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
thank you all

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Light allows us to see what Chie Yue imagined

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Light will drive the economy of the future

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Light enables us to reduce disease and treat disease

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Light guards our society

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Light will be the key to solving the most expensive problems of the mind

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
When the light fades and disappears on Dali

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
our day will be over

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And our future will shine and keep turning

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thanks

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,340
last shot elected one

129
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:17,920
The last shot was actually selected as an image of a very important promotion in the world

130
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,480
That image is a little girl

131
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,300
Not just now that girl has a picture

132
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,840
is a little girl

133
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,140
lying on a wooden floor

134
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,980
Then there is an LED light that costs less than one dollar next to it

135
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,020
that was in south america

136
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,840
a very poor remote country

137
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,900
places without electricity

138
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,680
children in

139
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,740
afternoon

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,280
After assisting parents Luo Blind

141
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,320
back home

142
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,380
Then use the Une

143
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,700
LED light provided

144
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,260
lying on the floor to write his day's

145
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,780
home work

146
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,580
those are

147
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,580
united nations humanitarian organization

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,960
The United Nations Culture and Education is the institution of UNEASYS

149
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,260
to help remote countries

150
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,900
In fact, in 2013, this activity has already been promoted by Promote

151
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,060
That's when UNESCO declared 2015 to be the International Year of Light

152
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,440
So why the International Year of Light?

153
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,420
Because in fact in 2005

154
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,260
Do you still remember the year when Building 101 was just completed?

155
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,380
None of his offices are rented out

156
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,180
Then the window later has an E equal to MC squared

157
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,380
Celebrating the Year of Physics

158
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,140
2015 is the year of light

159
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,340
There is also a chemical year and an astronomical year in between

160
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,860
why?

161
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,420
The reason, of course, is that light is a very important

162
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,540
is an important element of human civilization

163
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,740
an important element in the origin of life

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Arguments are currently important in medicine, communication, economy, environment, society, and culture

165
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,500
So it was decided to have a light year

166
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,200
85 UNESCO members from all over the world participated

167
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Although we are not, we in Taiwan also participated in this event

168
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,600
This event is a global event

169
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,000
Why do you want to promote this matter?

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,400
It is because human civilization, whether in science and technology, or in nature and culture

171
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,200
Light actually played a very important role.

172
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,400
Needless to say, many people know about this

173
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,100
but ignored it

174
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Because Laozi said that elephants have no form

175
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,900
It's just that many people take it granted

176
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,100
That is to say, take it for granted, as if the light turns on when you press your hand

177
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, a lot of things are not like that

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
in many places around the world

179
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,860
Human civilization still has a different aspect

180
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,860
This year of light has a LOGO

181
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,040
It is the light source representing the sun

182
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,740
origin perpetual culture very long

183
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,340
There are also representatives of various international countries and races

184
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
There is also a sense of tolerance

185
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,740
Then different colors represent different races

186
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,940
Spectrum also represents the diversity of science, art, culture, education, etc.

187
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,440
Diversified one LOGO

188
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:40,040
I have prepared ten badges for each

189
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,840
I'll send it to you later

190
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,840
There are two kinds here, there are twenty

191
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:51,240
One is the badge made by the International Society for Optoelectronic Engineering

192
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,640
The other one is Taiwan Fotonic Society

193
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,340
made badge

194
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,040
that was made by

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,380
Vice Chairman Sun Qingcheng designed it

196
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,140
There is a jade mountain at the bottom

197
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,780
Then the above LOGO is exactly the same

198
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,300
Wait a minute, if you are interested, you can come and get it

199
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,740
In addition to that

200
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,040
Why choose 2015

201
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,340
The reason is because of many important developments

202
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,900
like this 1965 50 years ago

203
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,300
Gao Kun and the others developed this optical fiber technology

204
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,340
then 1915

205
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,740
special relativity

206
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,100
general relativity

207
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,540
Estan's general theory of relativity

208
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,300
then 1865

209
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,500
Just happens to be Max Ware

210
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,100
He took all the physical properties of this light

211
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,000
explained in terms of electromagnetic waves

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
that 1815

213
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,900
Fernand believes that light has the property of fluctuations

214
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,260
And then, 2015 is the year Western Civilization decides for the first time that humans understand what light is

215
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,580
There is the first book on light

216
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,920
What about this one haytham , an arab

217
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,500
He was originally an intellectual, working for the Emperor

218
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,920
Then, later, he was imprisoned in prison for minor incidents

219
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,720
He is in prison, there is nothing to do

220
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,820
Because I am usually very busy, I have to prepare Powerpoint and speeches

221
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,880
There's nothing to do in prison

222
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:44,560
He began to notice that from sunrise to sunset, he looked at the fence of the cell

223
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,220
He discovered that light is a diameter, and then the shadow of light is like a straight line

224
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,080
So, he wrote down some very basic principles of optics

225
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,900
For example, say light is of diameter

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,040
The angle of this projection of light is relevant

227
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,640
He wrote some very basic concepts of geometric optics

228
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,640
The origin of books that were then identified as optics by Western civilization

229
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,840
But here are Mozi, Shenggua and Li Shizhen

230
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,840
In fact, Mozi was 2500 years ago

231
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:32,840
This one specifically writes some very important descriptions of optics.

232
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:40,840
That was also 3000 years ago in this year 1945

233
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:52,840
This in this 1945 in this prince's tomb in this Shanmen Gorge

234
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,840
This is the discovery of the Western State's foreign tax

235
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
That foreign tax is one

236
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,020
This concave copper mirror

237
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,700
It can actually be used to dry some

238
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,200
love grass or dried leaves

239
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,800
can be ignited

240
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,700
It's kind of like a lighter now

241
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,200
that is to pick up

242
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,600
Beat Lai and smoke a cigarette

243
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,100
or some incense

244
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,800
Then this is such a thing

245
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,400
and it's done really well

246
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,700
very well done

247
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
So the rep said

248
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,000
These technologies have actually been around for a long time.

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,400
Then in Needham's history of Chinese science and technology

250
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,100
I mentioned Mozi about

251
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,700
Optics Research Vs

252
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,500
known greece as early as

253
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,700
earlier than India and Arabia

254
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,200
Because Mozi was from 2500 years ago

255
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,100
So in Mokin he has drawings

256
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
that picture means

257
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,500
through a small hole

258
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,200
This image is upside down

259
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
That's all evidence

260
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,100
not made up

261
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
so here

262
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
include

263
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,280
Imaging with pinholes, including concave-convex mirror imaging

264
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Imaging including combined mirrors

265
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,620
In fact, two or three thousand years ago

266
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,280
Humans have probably recorded

267
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
and know these things

268
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
that's a pity

269
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,720
That is to say, the optics textbooks we read

270
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
I study optics

271
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,720
so no mention of these things

272
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,220
do not know either

273
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,660
Now everyone thinks that this optical

274
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,660
The very important reason is because

275
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,160
it is the origin of life

276
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,160
It is more important to keep in good health than everyone now

277
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,660
Very related to this Healthcare

278
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
and everyone knows

279
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,160
The mobile phones you are using now

280
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,160
In fact, when you pick up your mobile phone, it is transmitted to the base station.

281
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
The base station is directly connected to the aperture of the sewer

282
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,660
Then the aperture helps you run the longest distance

283
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Then the shortest way is actually to the base station

284
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,700
So this communication of light

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,560
In fact, it is to allow human civilization to have the so-called private message phone

286
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,260
The only way to have so-called various means of communication

287
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,280
In addition, many optical instruments and cosmic hot cables

288
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,860
Launch many artificial satellites from now on

289
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,520
Many devices to explore the universe

290
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,820
are actually optical devices

291
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,920
So optical activities are actually very important in science

292
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,520
on culture

293
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,020
also in education

294
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,980
still in nature

295
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,080
and art

296
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,780
It's actually quite important

297
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,580
I won't go back one by one

298
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,160
because time is limited

299
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,680
In the last slide, this part is about the design of light and shadow in general

300
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,600
And the lighting in your home

301
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,920
And the way these lights of the road project

302
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,280
Course Study Astronomy Universe

303
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,540
beautiful starry sky

304
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,800
I haven't seen the real Xinxin for a long time

305
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,840
Because there is a lot of light pollution in the city

306
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Actually light is a very, very important thing

307
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,540
For the environment

308
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,540
I'll explain more later

309
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,540
The bottom two are archaeological

310
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,540
this is in mexico with leda

311
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,540
It's a radar made of lasers

312
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,540
Do some scans of some old ruins

313
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,580
After scanning, there are some remains of pyramids

314
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Actually it's not very significant now

315
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,080
because after a long time

316
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,580
It's all covered with dust

317
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,580
But if you detect it optically

318
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
you can actually find

319
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,580
Some are already weathered

320
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
or thousands of years later

321
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,580
have turned into ruins like mud

322
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
So in fact optical technology

323
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,620
It is very, very important to the development of human civilization

324
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,340
OK, so this one was in 2015

325
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,840
Covers of various magazines and periodicals

326
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,240
It's all about light

327
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,840
In the end, some people even used optical communication

328
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
Look at Europe is 27.8TB per second

329
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,960
That is, 27.8 TB of bits are transferred in one second

330
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,960
But in Africa it's actually only 397Gb

331
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:38,920
If this difference is made, the transmission speed will be nearly five or six hundred times worse.

332
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,560
So it can be seen that the civilizations of various regions

333
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,320
In fact, it is closely related to optical communication or optical development.

334
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,760
So if we define the development of civilization on this earth by this

335
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,520
in fact a way

336
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,180
then say otherwise

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,640
Because the optical industry is called Fotonics Industry

338
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,360
Fotonics are photons

339
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,280
Fotonics is the research knowledge of photons

340
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,400
This field includes LED lighting

341
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Including image sensing

342
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,520
Communications including fiber optics

343
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,640
including precision optics

344
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,200
Light sources including lasers

345
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,560
including optical storage

346
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,080
Includes flat display

347
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,040
There is also an optical assist device

348
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,320
What is an optical auxiliary device

349
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,960
Optical auxiliary device is to convert photons into electrons

350
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,640
Then it becomes energy that can be used by human beings

351
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,200
Devices like solar cells

352
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,760
good

353
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,160
These areas have undergone major developments in human civilization

354
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,960
There are also very significant developments in Taiwan

355
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,560
Taiwan since 1996

356
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,020
industries with such optics

357
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
the optical industry

358
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,020
Improve every year

359
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,520
then you will ask me

360
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,520
What is the approximate amount of this industry?

361
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,020
You can take a look

362
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,020
It is in the field of the nine items just now

363
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,520
How many products we sell each year

364
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
It can be seen here

365
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,020
billions of billions each

366
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,020
$80 billion

367
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,020
That's 80 billion US dollars

368
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
We sell in Taiwan

369
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
These optoelectronic related industries

370
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
$80 billion

371
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
What is the largest of the 80 billion US dollars?

372
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
it is this

373
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,040
This is the Fed Panel Display

374
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,040
flat panel display

375
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
flat panel display

376
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,040
So this flat-panel display probably grew more than half of its output value

377
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,040
so in fact

378
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Taiwan is actually in the world

379
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Play an important role

380
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Because the global market is

381
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,060
Write 80 billion here

382
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,620
The global market is about 20 times bigger than ours

383
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,620
so we take 5 percent

384
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,960
we account for 5 percent

385
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,960
So the entire key market

386
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,500
It is very important to Taiwan's people's livelihood technology

387
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,500
employment, industrial development, scientific development of the country

388
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
is very important

389
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,700
So the Key Society of the Republic of China

390
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,200
United Nations Cultural Organization

391
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,000
There is also the cooperation of the International Wannian Engineering Society

392
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Our event is in fact an international event

436
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Invited Nam Kwong laser inventor Zhong Chunxiuer to give a speech in Taiwan

437
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We also organize activities for the International Year of Wisdom in various universities

438
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Also includes photoelectric week at Nangang International Exhibition Center

439
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There were about 50,000 to 60,000 people present

440
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So this event is actually a big event

441
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
In fact, this activity is very

442
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,640
It also includes organizing some activities in middle schools and high schools

443
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,440
this briefing and some presentations

444
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,400
There are also workshops with popular science lectures

from january to december

446
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,960
There are various activities every month

447
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,200
A total of more than 50 presentations

448
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,880
In North, Central, South, and East

449
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,880
For details, if you are interested, you can see

450
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,280
The RYL2015 International Year of Light Part Review

451
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,880
This page is actually

452
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,080
at the United Nations

453
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,280
Follow the website in Taiwan

454
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,480
can see the link

455
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,680
There are movies and photos

456
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,480
I won't go into details

457
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,680
this is his link

458
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,680
It is our Taiwan International Year of Light

459
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,880
Website, Lantern Festival website

460
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,080
There is also a link and address of the review video

461
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,780
Designed by Sun Qingcheng and the director of the Key Institute of Sun Central University

462
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:10,000
It is this LOGO plus in Taiwan

463
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This is a mountain with three veins

464
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,640
Well, that is to say, all the people in Taiwan who participated in this activity

465
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,940
There are probably more than two thousand people

466
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,540
2,000 person-times, because including production officers and trainees

467
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,040
To sum it up, why do you want to do this?

468
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,040
because we think light is actually very important

469
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:45,540
It will have a major impact on Taiwan's future culture and people's livelihood technology

470
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:51,440
Those of us who may have bought stocks know that

471
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,040
At present, Largan is still the stock king or the stock queen.

472
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:00,040
That is to say, mobile phones around the world

473
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
this lens

474
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That's only us in Taiwan

475
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
This compound lens can be done

476
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the size of a grain of rice

477
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
confidential optics

478
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Then the lens module like this

479
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Can be marketed all over the world

480
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Then everyone depends on us

481
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
This confidential optical lens

482
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
do this

483
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
camera lens

484
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So this is a very important development

485
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
In addition to that

486
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
the year of international

487
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's actually a rare opportunity

488
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Put us Taiwan on top of the international

489
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
there is one

490
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
a chance to show

491
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
A platform to communicate with everyone

492
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
so

493
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
We will work very hard to do this

494
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Well, I spent about ten minutes telling this story.

495
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Then I will report to you next time.

496
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
is the recent story of optics

497
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
What happened to optics recently?

498
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'll probably tell you guys first

499
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
what is photonics

500
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
that photonics

501
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,140
You can imagine lasers, like this laser pointer

502
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,020
Then CCD KEMENR, CCD KEMENR won the Nobel Prize

503
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:17,400
This Guangqian Gaokun also won the Nobel Prize for Guangqian Communication

504
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:26,120
Then the focusing of light, because of optical focusing, we have microscopes and astronomical telescopes for such things

505
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:38,400
Then, solar cells, our southern campus is at Shalun Farm, which will become a demonstration base for green energy photoelectricity in the future

506
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,240
Then, there will be solar cells everywhere

507
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,900
As for BioSensor, BioSensor has gradually become more and more important in Taiwan, because I don’t have

508
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:58,880
Showed a lot of other market development information, currently Taiwan's optoelectronics industry

509
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,900
In the past two years, this Bio Photonics has accounted for 8%

510
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,700
Is to grow gradually from scratch

511
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,300
Slowly start growing over five years

512
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,140
Many things are Bio Sensors

513
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,980
And there is Bio Image

514
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,980
Bio Image actually spoke at Norbert Herschel in 2014

515
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,980
Just for Bio Image

516
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,580
If I work on this aspect, I will try to find a way to report to you.

517
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,680
So my next story will be divided into three parts

518
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,480
The first part is Green Life

519
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,180
The second one is Bin Light

520
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,480
The third part is Future World

521
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,980
What is Green Light What is Bin Light What is Future World

522
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,480
I will take three examples individually and report to you

523
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,980
那 Photonics for Green World

524
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,980
That is to say now everyone knows this

525
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,880
Human civilization has developed to this day

526
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,080
What everyone wants is a very clean

527
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,840
A very healthy and hygienic environment

528
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,040
A very beautiful future world

529
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,240
So we all say that we hope that we can not consume

530
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,640
No matter what is consumed, nothing is consumed

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,880
no waste

532
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,920
And keep it very simple, very clean

533
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,220
need to be able to do this

534
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,080
In fact science is a very important development

535
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,320
So how to do this

536
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,620
The first point is to say

537
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,020
Many things in human civilization are being explored

538
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,920
That is to say we used to do

539
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
But can we do better now

540
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,720
One of the most typical is this solar auxiliary device

541
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,260
What is a tutoring device basically?

542
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,960
basically it says

543
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,300
The sun's light travels 8 minutes to the earth

544
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,860
Then humans on the earth develop some devices

545
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:12,800
These devices convert the energy of this light into electrons

546
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
convert photons into electrons

547
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,460
This electron can then be used to light a light bulb

548
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,460
or cooking

549
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,960
Or do other uses of electric vehicles

550
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,460
Harrie Walter of Caltech

551
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,460
One of the world's leading teams in their lab

552
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,960
Caltech also has one of the world's leading green energy centers

553
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,460
he is the director of the center

554
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,960
He proposed that on the solar cell

555
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,960
put these very tiny nanoparticles

556
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,460
These nanoparticles allow these light

557
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,960
During this process

558
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Generate more electrons during the action

559
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
can be more efficient

560
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,960
How to put these nanometer metal particles

561
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
can be placed on the most surface

562
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,820
It can be placed at the interface of this semiconductor

563
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,480
That can also be placed behind this

564
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,680
Do some unavoidable structure behind

565
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,960
So they did a lot of experiments like this

566
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,720
to study

567
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,680
It was found that the efficiency can be improved

568
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,640
Then how much would you say the efficiency has improved?

569
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,160
The highest and ultimate efficiency of human civilization

570
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,000
That is, 100 photons

571
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,200
How many can be converted into electrons

572
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,800
about 20 or so

573
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,960
What about the 20?

574
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,760
if it can improve

575
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,040
Assume 10%

576
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
That means

577
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,320
That's 20, that's two more

578
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,280
You may not mind

579
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,200
But what?

580
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,440
The photon is actually very, very large

581
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,880
energy from the sun to the earth

582
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,960
It's actually very, very strong

583
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,240
very rich

584
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,560
a lot of

585
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,800
So a very small increase in efficiency

586
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,360
In fact, it is a very big step in human civilization.

587
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,600
so this is a very important thing

588
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:17,400
Therefore, all countries in the world, especially advanced countries, attach great importance to this point.

589
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,440
We are short of a round of professors at Tsinghua University in Taiwan

590
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,040
His Tianan battery like this in CIGS

591
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,680
There are many kinds of Tianan batteries

592
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,400
Some are using Silicon with fine

593
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,320
Some are made of diversified metals

594
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:44,880
Tianan battery made of multiple compound semiconductor materials

595
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,640
it incorporates particles of gold

596
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:55,160
There is also an east-west interlayer of the fluidized compartment.

597
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,280
He found that he could actually improve this efficiency

598
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,820
Can be increased from 8.3% to 10.3%

599
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,420
increased by 2%

600
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,720
You'd say 2% is no big deal

601
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,300
Actually 2% is pretty big

602
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,900
Because 0.5% is a big deal

603
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,300
Don't talk about 2%

604
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,400
So his job is a very important job

605
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,720
And he illuminates from different angles

606
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,560
no mezzanine like this

607
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,360
with such a mezzanine

608
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,360
His performance can be from 350 nm wavelength to

609
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,560
This wavelength of nearly 1000 nanometers

610
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,160
have a very good performance

611
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,560
very balanced performance

612
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,860
for different angles of incidence

613
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,560
He can have a very high absorption

614
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,360
it's not easy

615
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,060
What about Professor Chen Wenwen from National Taiwan University?

616
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,360
he is also very clever

617
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
He made one like this

618
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,680
This is a PVP plain glue

619
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,500
then snag

620
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,680
in the process of spinning

621
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,180
It puts silver grains inside this easy

622
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,440
then snag

623
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,400
Then when spinning

624
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,080
It first puts a small metal carrier

625
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,200
and turn like this

626
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
like faux sand

627
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,080
when it was like sand

628
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,240
you will find

629
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
It can imitate sand like this first

630
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,080
Then it can turn the artificial sand 90 degrees again

631
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,480
Then imitate sand like this

632
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,380
After imitation sand

633
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,280
Inside the plastic PVP inside

634
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,880
Contains some gold particles

635
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,680
Containing percentages from 1.39 to 0.36 to 0.07

636
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,080
The less it contains, of course the finer the silk can be drawn

637
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,680
kinda like silk

638
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,180
Then it does this thing

639
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,480
It then puts this thing inside the solar cell

640
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,480
This organic semiconductor solar cell

641
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,880
at this

642
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,500
top of electrode

643
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,380
then he found

644
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,860
It's in the spectrum of visible light

645
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,180
his external quantum efficiency

646
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,880
Can be increased from 40% 50% to 60%

647
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,880
So this is also a very important development.

648
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,840
So our scientist in Taiwan

649
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,740
Work very hard to do these state-of-the-art work

650
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,420
Also at the same time in this

651
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,120
Rice University

652
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,920
Rice University in America

653
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,020
they have a very amazing one

654
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,580
American Academy of Sciences

655
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,240
He heard that he is now an academician of four academies

656
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,980
called Niamihara's

657
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,280
He was the first in the world to propose

658
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,480
Put this Daimi's metal pellets

659
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,180
This kind of photothermal therapy for cancer

660
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,900
Just let the metal particles like this absorb

661
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Then heat the cancer cells to death

662
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
This is their animal experiment

663
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And they've been approved by the FDA

664
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
to do some human experiments

665
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
12 days after the tumor

666
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
just end up scum

667
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
becomes very very small

668
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That is to say, it is very effective to do such a thing

669
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Those are the things that make human life

670
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
some things that could be better

671
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Professor Huang Guozhu at Tsinghua University in Taiwan

672
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
too done such a thing

673
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
but he is smarter

674
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
He took the nanoparticle

675
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
made like a sea urchin

676
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
one by one thorn

677
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
then you can see this sea urchin

678
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
This is the magnetic marker at 100 nanometers

679
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Then this is about a few hundred nanometers

680
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Five or six hundred nanometers

681
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
such sea urchin

682
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
then a lot of thorny words

683
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
he made the mouse

684
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
to deduce

685
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,760
After having an Essie bag culture

686
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,360
Let particles like this adsorb on the Essie bag

687
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,840
Then it shines infrared light in

688
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,600
It can generate more of these free machines

689
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Then heat the root and kill the Essie bag

690
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,600
Then the Essie bag will shrink

691
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,320
this was very very successful

692
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,160
You may ask, what is the relationship between the thorn and the particle?

693
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,360
Because they make glutinous rice balls, why do you make sea urchins?

694
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,360
It's simple, stab a lot of words

695
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,960
It is easier to receive these light and generate heat

696
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,720
So this is easy to do

697
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,120
Ms. Liu Ruxi from the Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University

698
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,760
he is better

699
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,120
He should do the thorn, it's not easy to do it small

700
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,320
so he made it small

701
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,320
You see this is a 20 nanometer scale

702
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,520
The one just now was a 100-nanometer scale

703
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,520
5. As big as 600 nanometers

704
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,360
There is a limit to how many pills you can swallow

705
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,860
If it is very small, it can swallow a lot

706
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,140
swallow a lot of words

707
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,440
Ant Xiong Bin

708
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,040
it's powerful

709
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,600
so you can

710
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,440
It is easy to enter directly from the cell membrane

711
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,720
because it's too small

712
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,640
After cell membrane invasion

713
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,440
Demonstrate like this

714
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,360
You cover this one up

715
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,560
that cancer cell died

716
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,960
these are cancer cells

717
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,600
are cancer cells

718
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,360
Cancer cells cultured on glass

719
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,760
Then you light mask

720
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,960
because these cancer cells

721
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
After swallowing such small particles

722
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,120
easy to kill

723
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,240
So this is a very interesting development

724
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,560
Then Li Xianming from the Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica

725
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,640
researcher

726
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,800
he is better

727
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,320
Because just after the light went down

728
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Your skin and flesh will block some of the light

729
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,480
Can't get in

730
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,360
So he wanted a hood

731
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,120
He said he could get in

732
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,760
It must be infrared light with a relatively long wavelength

733
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,320
So he put these things just now

734
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,840
put on a so-called up-conversion material

735
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,300
Up-conversion means that I use a long wavelength to enter

736
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,460
it converts it to a shorter wavelength

737
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:17,140
But you clean the skin and these tissues of these animals

738
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:23,120
When hitting these refugee particles that can kill cancer cells

739
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,300
it converts

740
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,100
so it doesn't waste the light

741
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,060
and it can go deep into the organization

742
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,020
Therefore, Professor Li Xianming and Researcher Li Xianming's

743
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,020
This so-called up-conversion

744
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,420
It's easy for you to see

745
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,260
it uses something like this upconversion

746
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,420
allows you to see these cells very clearly

747
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,820
this is a very important development

748
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,900
just talked about green

749
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,540
Green must be related to the environment

750
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,940
So this is British

751
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,160
Professor Durant of Inpirit College

752
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,400
He has one idea

753
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,200
a future environment

754
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,400
Future environment sun shines down

755
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,900
and then in this various ways

756
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,100
convert sunlight energy into chemical energy

757
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,500
or converted into this mechanical energy

758
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,500
or converted into electrical energy

759
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,600
Then store energy in this way

760
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,700
use as a human

761
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:35,700
Then don't develop something like nuclear energy, which is very dangerous

762
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,000
Or not to develop the highly dangerous thermal power generation

763
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,500
things like burning coal

764
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,400
Because in fact, the PN2.5 produced by burning coal

765
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,200
Worse than a nuclear power plant

766
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,500
So here are some of his wonderful thoughts

767
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,500
but all these beautiful thoughts

768
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,500
It involves the efficiency of converting photons into electrons

769
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,000
The problem of the efficiency of converting photons into electrons

770
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
In 1972, the Japanese discovered a very important thing, which is the effect of beauty in light.

771
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
There is a semiconductor carbon dioxide, which can effectively convert photons into electrons

772
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Happens when it's unlikely, becomes a lot when it's rare

773
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So a very important milestone is the hydrolysis experiment called Guangximei

774
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Such a substance of carbon dioxide is called Guangchumei substance

775
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You may have seen that there are many toilets in Taiwan that are written by Guang Chumei.

776
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Then many supplies write about what are the cosmetic products used for light treatment? They are used for antibacterial

777
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Deodorizing and antibacterial, because it will produce some

778
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,680
These electrons make bacteria uncomfortable

779
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
prevent bacteria from growing

780
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,520
It can also be used for water treatment

781
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
And do water decomposition

782
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,280
There are many other good uses

783
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,320
That Century Han did the best

784
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,820
Professor Yang Peidong from Berkeley

785
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,320
He developed something like this

786
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,120
Some very special electrodes for hydrolysis

787
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,600
This electrode has these photocatalyst nanoparticles

788
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,800
Then he can effectively

789
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Speed ​​up the hydrolysis rate of such a

790
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,800
efficiency improvement

791
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,300
Professor Liu Ruxi, Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University

792
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,800
He is also working very hard on this aspect.

793
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,800
That is not lost to Professor Yang Peidong of Berkeley University

794
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,300
They use this special effect of surface electric resonance

795
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,400
On such a photocatalyst, some small nanoparticles are adsorbed

796
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,900
These are tiny nanoparticles that allow incoming light to generate photoelectrons

797
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,400
Then let these photoelectrons oscillate inside

798
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,100
It's just the cloud wrapping around and never going away

799
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
It's not like you come in and have a talk and then leave to play a safe ball.

800
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,000
it doesn't come in, it stays in

801
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,900
So it can effectively localize photons in a small range

802
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,400
and then to produce a strong effect

803
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,100
This effect allows the photochemical reaction to produce hydrolysis

804
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:48,400
So some experiments like this are conducted by Chen Yulin, Department of Physics, National Taiwan University.

805
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:56,200
This Mr. Chen is doing some interesting things in my laboratory

806
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,000
He just took the discarded CD and took it

807
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
do an interesting experiment

808
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
That is to say, on the CD for flight

809
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
It is very simple to let it grow some small light and beautiful materials

810
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Then put this flying CD drive

811
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
just hug me

812
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
and put it in here

813
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Then it can put this dye

814
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
some dyes just do the processing

815
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
After processing these chemical dyes

816
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
will become

817
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
At first a colored false base

818
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
it is a standard dye

819
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Then do it and suck it up from above

820
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
dripping down on this flying disc

821
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
The chicken soup underneath will turn into clear water

822
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Just ask me where those dye molecules go

823
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Then CO2 turns into H2O and runs away

824
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,500
Just dispersed in the air and went away

825
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,340
so what can he do with it

826
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,500
It can be used for waste water treatment

827
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Wastewater Treatment Jobs

828
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,620
because he can decompose some

829
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:11,640
decompose

830
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,540
It is to give some harmful chemical substances to

831
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,220
spies interrupted

832
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:17,980
Then what

833
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,660
what about this matter

834
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,760
It's actually just a small project

835
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,300
Projects taught to students

836
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,760
AAS

837
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,760
Also by BBC News in London, UK

838
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,760
evening News

839
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,760
just say you know

840
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,760
The Taiwanese took the CD for the plane

841
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
to treat sewer water

842
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
that water is still drinkable

843
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,760
You know when word gets around

844
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
global report

845
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,760
And then we got close to this one or two hundred letters

846
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,760
asked us to give them that movie

847
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,760
they are going to do

848
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,760
Then there are many high school students in the United States

849
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,760
Said they were going to bake

850
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,760
do this

851
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,760
good

852
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,760
Then our hard science center

853
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,860
He's in the researcher, he's actually just been in water treatment

854
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:11,820
In fact, he told me that a while ago, everyone was very careful with food

855
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,400
Especially pesticides, and some toxic chemicals

856
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,600
Affects food, he does one thing in particular

857
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:25,200
He asked if there was any way to quickly test the residual pesticides

858
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:33,720
So he just made normal slides like this

859
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:41,920
It's an A4-sized slide, and he used it to make some Naimi structures on it

860
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,400
Then, in these Nami structures, he can build them piece by piece

861
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,640
He can lower the things you want to test on top

862
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,280
For example, tearing down the leaves and smashing them into pieces, lowering them to the top

863
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,040
Then you can see the real-time test from the above performance

864
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,600
This one doesn't seem to work

865
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,960
Let me tell you that this is its Akuan No. 1

866
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,300
This is a plastic sheet in A4 size

867
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,060
it just has a thing

868
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,640
just put it in

869
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,180
Stamped stamped stamped

870
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,800
covered many, many nanostructures

871
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,640
These nanostructures are stamped one by one like this

872
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,360
These seals are sensors

873
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,260
This sensor sees with the naked eye

874
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,440
very clever

875
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,640
Its sensitivity is a world record

876
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,080
broken world record

877
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,760
very high sensitivity

878
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,920
You can see the color directly with the naked eye

879
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,720
So it recently did an interesting technology transfer

880
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,640
Just put your phone directly on its sensor

881
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,480
You can see it just inside this

882
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,400
The concentration of that glory is from the right

883
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,000
glory few to left glory many

884
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,720
You can see how much glory you have when you drop it

885
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,000
You can know in which grid

886
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,120
So the phone can take a picture

887
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,720
After taking a picture with the phone

888
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,000
The mobile phone has an APP

889
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,200
I can tell you

890
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,720
You are now honored, what is the glory in Zen language?

891
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,920
he told me yesterday

892
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,720
Now the most commonly tested is edamide

893
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,000
The limit of Yidaan residue is 0.5ppm

894
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
to 3 ppm

895
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,320
Usually more than 3 ppm

896
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,800
The limit of how deep they can be measured is 0.01

897
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,960
That is to say, they have high seniority

898
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,000
This is what they actually measured

899
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
They will cooperate with Glory

900
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
at the end of last year

901
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
This job also held a press conference

902
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
It's the honor meeting they opened

903
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,600
So some work on this

904
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
In fact, Taiwan does not

905
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,360
I have also done a lot, and it is very advanced

906
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,920
It's just that many people are very busy with certain things

907
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,480
don't know its development

908
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,320
So today I hope to have the opportunity to report to you

909
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,520
The second part is about this

910
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,840
Part of BinLine

911
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,240
The part of the BinLine that says

912
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,280
production of light, use of light

913
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,320
And what about these things?

914
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,640
some of the latest developments

915
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,080
Professor Xiang Zhang at Berkeley University

916
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,000
He is also an academician of our Academia Sinica

917
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,440
and Terry Olden from Northwestern

918
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,880
The two of them are in this

919
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,000
The smallest light source in the world

920
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,640
well done lab

921
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,360
One is nanorods with so-called fluidized spacers

922
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,320
on a silver surface

923
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,120
Then the world's smallest

924
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,100
Laser, then this is the spectrum of the light emitted by the laser

925
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Very uniform, very good

926
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:20,100
Then the other Terry Ogden they use a different fluid to flow through

927
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:25,600
A metal particle like this will be found to say

928
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,200
They can produce different liquids when flowing through such particles

929
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,200
If the refractive index is different, the wavelength of the laser light it produces is not the same

930
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:41,100
Then the two of them are currently known to be the best in the world.

931
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:46,200
Then we in Taiwan might as well let Professor Guo Shangzhi of Tsinghua University

932
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:53,900
After the two of them, he also published the so-called

933
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:59,300
Nano Isshiki made of a column made of nitrided nano

934
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,300
The nano particles

935
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,260
What is the difference between Nanolaser and Nanolaser just now?

936
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,660
The nano-laser just now is not a semiconductor laser

937
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,660
That's a semiconductor laser

938
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,620
And it is at long temperature

939
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,120
Yishi that can be produced at a long temperature

940
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,460
And its efficiency and the light produced by its power

941
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,960
are very very strong

942
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,420
And the quality of light is much better than before

943
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,880
Much better quality published by any other lab

944
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,880
So teacher Guo's nano laser

945
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,880
In fact its directionality

946
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:44,380
And its temperature control is very, very good

947
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,380
I won't go into details

948
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:52,880
In addition, Mr. Guo recently developed a variety of different wavelengths

949
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,880
that is, different colors

950
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,880
various nanolasers

951
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,880
And they're doing really well

952
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,220
This is the smallest semiconductor laser in the world

953
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,820
It's only 50 nanometers wide and 200 nanometers long

954
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:12,740
This record has not been broken so far

955
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,560
So it is the light of our Taiwan

956
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,460
Well, he's also the director of our Synchrotron Radiation Center.

957
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,220
Professor of Department of Physics, Tsinghua University

958
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,340
In addition, this Professor Zhang Xiangzhang

959
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,920
He also developed a type that is like a disc

960
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,720
But this disk is very small

961
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,680
Everyone, take a look, this is 1micron

962
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:40,640
If it is 1micron, everyone knows that your hair is about 500micron

963
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,920
5 percent of your hair

964
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,920
so small a small ring

965
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:57,180
plate, this plate will produce this circular circular resonant gun laser

966
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,140
His advantage is that he is very

967
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,840
very very narrow wavelength

968
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,600
very very thin

969
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,600
Such research is rare

970
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,800
Professor No. 4 of the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University

971
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,960
He also used similar techniques in two-dimensional materials

972
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,200
Molidae

973
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,240
It's on the sample of second fluidized wood

974
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,200
found that if you put a sample like this

975
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,600
The resulting quantum efficiency

976
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,800
is the efficiency with which photons generate electrons

977
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:40,800
Can be improved from 0.9% to 99%

978
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,400
look this is very very bright

979
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
emit a lot of light

980
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:51,800
It's unfortunate that he was caught by this Arab

981
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,200
this

982
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,200
Saudi Abo

983
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,800
dig this corner

984
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,200
University Awareness in Saudi Abo

985
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
He is no longer in National Taiwan University

986
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
he did very very well

987
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Of course, Professor Lu Luxi Liu of National Taiwan University

988
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
he in the past few years

989
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
He also did a very, very good job

990
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I just mentioned that he made all kinds of

991
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Materials for nano optoelectronics

992
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
In fact his most famous

993
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
All LED companies in Taiwan

994
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
hire him as a consultant

995
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's his fluorescent powder

996
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
he put this

997
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Magnolite with four positive ions

998
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
of this float

999
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,000
He tried to get him some grooming

1000
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
then produce fluorescence

1001
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Then the color temperature of the fluorescent light it produces

1002
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
very very very human

1003
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
that is

1004
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
The previous color temperature was too high

1005
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
after too high

1006
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Your eyes get dizzy after looking at it for a long time

1007
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Then the color temperature it produces is very mild

1008
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
relatively low temperature

1009
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
that won't hurt you

1010
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It is a nerve, and it will not produce some sequelae such as white viscera

1011
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,500
Speaking of this, in fact there is a Chen Yuren in our center, Professor Chen

1012
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:18,800
He is very interested in this, he told me since I knew him

1013
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:25,000
He specializes in semiconductor optoelectronics, that is, someone who makes things like Guo Shangzhi and Guo Teacher

1014
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:31,500
He said that they found that they grow vegetables when they are very popular in Taiwan recently

1015
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:36,000
Use this semiconductor light source to grow vegetables

1016
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You say crazy, why don't you grow vegetables outside

1017
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Planting vegetables outside, there will be insects after the light is on, and there is no way to control the environment

1018
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Then when the typhoon comes, the vegetables will not grow

1019
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
So one dish costs hundreds of dollars, very expensive

1020
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So they say I grow vegetables by hand

1021
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
the idea is very nice

1022
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,440
Because our semiconductor industry in Taiwan is very good

1023
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,160
So LED made the world's number one

1024
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,840
Use LED as light source to grow vegetables

1025
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,520
sell it to those deserts

1026
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,040
Or sell to those Arab countries

1027
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,440
it or those with bad environment

1028
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,040
Very harsh places like the North Pole and the South Pole

1029
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,520
The kind of area where it is dark for half a year

1030
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,200
isn't it good

1031
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,120
but he said he told me

1032
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,320
This vegetable has just been planted with a lot of technology and new regulations to grow vegetables

1033
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,840
and after planting

1034
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,840
Wow, the vegetables are growing so fast, so beautiful, so happy

1035
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,920
And it is a water root plant, absolutely no pesticides

1036
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,920
Take it up and eat it, it makes a crackling sound

1037
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,120
But that dish is neither sweet nor fragrant nor tasty

1038
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,040
It is different from the natural vegetables outside

1039
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,320
Then after many people give up

1040
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,320
after that segregation testimony

1041
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,400
Some people slowly get the hang of it, he said it's not right

1042
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,400
He said what kind of light the vegetables should be exposed to when they were young

1043
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,900
When will it grow and when will it shine?

1044
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,600
When it grows up to this time, it needs to be illuminated by this light, and when it is grown up, it must be illuminated by that light

1045
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,400
Then what kind of light should I shine on the next few days?

1046
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,900
That vegetable tastes delicious, and it's even better than vegetables grown outside

1047
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:27,800
That becomes a very ceremonial thing

1048
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:32,600
And what's even more strange is that he said that the light is terrible

1049
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,000
That is to say, after the people who make LEDs use a lot of light

1050
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,700
Discover the light that your human eyes see

1051
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,200
Thought it was all the same, it's not

1052
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,200
It's not just you that affects your sleep

1053
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,400
and with your nervous system

1054
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:54,200
and your behavior

1055
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,800
and your mood

1056
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,100
And you are sports

1057
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and your ability, and your memory

1058
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Also, your hormones

1059
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
and yours

1060
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
This cycle of physiological cellular responses

1061
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It also has something to do with your biological clock.

1062
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So it's the same with people

1063
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
The same goes for dishes

1064
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
that dish at different times

1065
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
In fact, the light he wants to be thin is different.

1066
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
so this is amazing

1067
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So they started playing with the light

1068
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Especially playing around with this different wavelength

1069
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
light sources of different colors

1070
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Then find a dense like this

1071
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
recipe to do what they want to do

1072
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Then this involves some photochemical reactions

1073
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I won't go into details about that

1074
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Well, this Chenye man, Professor Chen, is very powerful

1075
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So this design varies

1076
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Refugee structure produces light of different wavelengths

1077
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,280
some like this, some with their heads off

1078
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,480
Some are pointy, some have broken heads

1079
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,480
This kind of rice pillar

1080
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,480
then it produces different light

1081
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,680
Here you can see different colors of light

1082
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,680
Red Dust Yellow Green Blue Electronics

1083
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,680
Wavelength and its distribution

1084
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,680
all knowledge

1085
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,680
these things are fun

1086
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,680
Another thing is

1087
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:29,180
Our Researcher Li Chaohuang

1088
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:35,180
He likes to observe some behaviors of cells

1089
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,180
he discovered that cells

1090
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:41,180
see a cell, it's a dwarf cell

1091
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:47,180
Here is red light, the wavelength is 1064

1092
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,180
Violet light here, the wavelength is 405

1093
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:54,180
As a result, the cell is very happy, and it continues to grow

1094
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,180
It's not happy here, it wants to retract its feet

1095
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,180
After a period of time, the cells

1096
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,960
So it means that even a single cell has a good understanding of light.

1097
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,460
have likes and dislikes

1098
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,060
It comes from a study like this

1099
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:17,560
You can see that this is a culture of cancer cells

1100
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,940
It hits a triangle with a light hitting this place

1101
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,000
Let's hit a square light here

1102
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,600
after a long time

1103
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,540
Where the light is lit, the cells are scattered

1104
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:36,340
where it doesn't like to be in this 473 nanometer light

1105
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:38,940
That 473 is purple light

1106
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,960
it doesn't like

1107
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,440
so you see it spread out

1108
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,040
it's definitely no accident

1109
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:49,300
Then Mr. Li Changheng Li told me that

1110
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,080
why ? because they are afraid of death

1111
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,600
He said after you look at the picture for a long time

1112
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,600
the nuclei of these cells

1113
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,600
shrinking

1114
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,600
will die

1115
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,680
So it is afraid of death, so it spreads out

1116
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,860
so this is very important

1117
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:09,460
So this light actually, here is another movie

1118
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,740
it puts the light outside on purpose

1119
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,180
Then slowly change this lit area

1120
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,060
Then the cell escapes

1121
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:18,820
just run away

1122
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:22,860
There is no light here, these are the areas of light

1123
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:25,860
You see the cells run away from here again

1124
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,940
That is to say, like Ganyang, you can design a trap

1125
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,960
Change it up so the cells are like your sheep

1126
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,800
can do whatever you want

1127
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,640
In addition, it also conducted an experiment

1128
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,840
But this doesn't seem to work, the movie won't move

1129
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,920
That is to say, the light here will generate a

1130
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,600
From light intensity to light weakness, a T degree

1131
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,560
This cell was originally in this place

1132
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,440
It deliberately hit the body of this cell

1133
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,160
This cell will quickly escape to this place from here

1134
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,720
Escape to that brightness where it can feel non-life threatening

1135
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,120
it just stops

1136
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,720
So here is a T degree

1137
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,200
There is a staircase-like intensity from high to low

1138
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:16,560
After escaping to a certain intensity it can

1139
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:24,120
So from now on, we can know that light actually has a very, very, very, very, very, very very impact on life.

1140
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,840
There is also Chen Bizhang in our India Center

1141
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,320
Teacher Chen

1142
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:35,280
Ms. Chen joined our center in July 2013

1143
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:43,600
He specializes in this interesting work called

1144
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:52,880
3D movies of living cells or biological samples

1145
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,840
He said that he specialized in making this kind of film just like making a movie.

1146
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,840
that his

1147
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,600
The male and female protagonists of the movie are all kinds of biological tissues

1148
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:08,440
when i made a movie

1149
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,440
especially in the microscope filming

1150
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,640
The hero and heroine must do something

1151
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,400
Just put some hot pepper on it to fix him

1152
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,880
just dead

1153
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,880
can't move

1154
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,440
I can't see clearly when I move

1155
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,840
then he is not

1156
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,960
He developed a new technique that is

1157
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,280
He can see anything

1158
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,440
And can see more clearly than others

1159
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,640
alive again

1160
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,040
Moreover, he can see images from all directions in real time.

1161
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,440
the most important point

1162
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,880
That is to say, the image he saw

1163
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,880
yes

1164
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,680
this is a formula

1165
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,880
formula engraved in stone

1166
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,440
by Professor Abbe

1167
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,000
Professor Abbe died in 1905

1168
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,200
He is an independent director of Zeiss AG

1169
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,120
Then he wrote down this formula

1170
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,120
that is

1171
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,500
Recording is proportional to wavelength

1172
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:07,160
Refractive index of the lens used

1173
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,560
inversely proportional to the dirty angle of the lens

1174
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,340
The Sci-C tower is inversely proportional to

1175
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,000
This means that the world knows

1176
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
color limit

1177
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,500
This mainland China is called the limit of color rendering

1178
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,700
It is called Deflection Limit in English

1179
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,800
That is to say, no matter how you look at it

1180
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,000
see things with an optical microscope

1181
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
basically about half a wavelength of resolution

1182
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
This is what everyone knows

1183
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,100
Our Professor Chen Mizhen

1184
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,000
He can break through the limit like this

1185
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,200
Former Yongjian academician he won the Nobel Prize

1186
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,500
because of the use of fluorescent green protein

1187
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,200
fluorescent green protein

1188
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,200
It's about two nanometers wide

1189
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,500
Then three nanometers in length

1190
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,600
A fluorescent molecule like this

1191
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Another focused light spot, a focused light spot is about two to three hundred nanometers

1192
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Then put a fluorescent molecule in such a small one, about 1/500th of it

1193
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Then, if you look at the fluorescent image, this light spot is about 1/500th of the entire cell.

1194
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:27,000
So use such a light spot to look at the fluorescent molecules in a cell

1195
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It can obtain very high-dimensional images, you can take a look

1196
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
This is an image of live feed

1197
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:44,000
If you can see the upper left, if your eyes are good enough

1198
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The purple in the upper left represents the nucleus

1199
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Green represents the number of microtubules

1200
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Red represents a stereo

1201
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,000
it is the image of a cell

1202
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,800
Image of a fluorescent green protein called a cell

1203
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,300
Using such technology

1204
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,100
for different proteins

1205
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:12,100
Bottom is an image of a mouse neuron

1206
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,100
Both are dead fixed

1207
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:20,100
Different colors represent different proteins

1208
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:22,100
you can see

1209
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,600
It is very clear that such different representations

1210
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,600
these states of protein

1211
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Then you can see the cells

1212
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,700
Cellular organelles that can be seen inside the cell

1213
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,700
You can also see protein

1214
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,700
You can also see the real-time video like this

1215
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,200
Just ask me what he thinks

1216
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,700
of course he's amazing

1217
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,700
he invented a technique

1218
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,400
This technology is the same as in 2014

1219
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:56,900
Technology developed with Professor Eric Bezit, Nobel Prize in Chemistry

1220
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,000
This technique is the general optical microscope is like this

1221
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
The objective lens of the microscope is focused on the sample

1222
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
What about after you look at it like this?

1223
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Because what you look at in front of you and behind you will interfere with you

1224
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
like during the day, everyone

1225
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Can you see the stars in the sky? Can't you?

1226
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
only at night

1227
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Because there is no such light pollution at night

1228
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Can you see the stars?

1229
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So the stars are always there

1230
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
just remove the background

1231
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So this background will affect you

1232
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
So generally speaking, use confoco

1233
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Confoco focuses the light spot to a very small point

1234
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
or to photo, multi-photo

1235
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
look at this sample

1236
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Then swipe this sample

1237
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
about ten years ago

1238
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
they developed a technique

1239
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
That is to say, I don't want to use this light

1240
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I light from the side

1241
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
If you have this experience

1242
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Walk into a room and see a light count down

1243
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
it's full of dust

1244
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
That's because you're here to light

1245
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
your eyes can see

1246
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Otherwise, how can you usually see the dust?

1247
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
then this is the concept

1248
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
It's just a ray of light

1249
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
you are in this area of ​​no light

1250
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Look at the effect of light and matter

1251
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
So this can see a lot

1252
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
flash some images

1253
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
that flashing image

1254
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
you can put very small things

1255
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
can show

1256
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
that goes further

1257
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
they were in previous years

1258
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
how about a light like this

1259
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
so-called back handle

1260
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Then you will ask me what is a back handle

1261
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Reciprocal square is a fraction of mathematics

1262
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
What about the production of the back handle?

1263
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
It is the tail of this object

1264
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Raiwei it puts the light in the light

1265
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
just become a circle

1266
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
a ring light

1267
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
After typing in

1268
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
The ring light will focus

1269
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Interfering with each other after focusing

1270
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
interfere with each other

1271
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
some interference fringes

1272
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
You can see it in the next picture

1273
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,540
It shoots light in, and it shoots light in with two object paths

1274
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:10,040
One is light coming in, after the light comes in, the light will interfere with each other

1275
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,840
As far as two lights are concerned, after interference, interference fringes will be produced one by one.

1276
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:18,040
This is the interference fringe, this puts some dye in it

1277
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,240
You can see these interference fringes one by one

1278
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:27,600
Then these interference fringes are the same as the focus just now

1279
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,760
Gather to a minimum thickness of about 500 microns

1280
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:36,260
This is about 0.5micron thick

1281
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,600
Sorry for my mistake, this is about 5micron in thickness

1282
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:46,260
This is the thickness of 0.5micron, one-tenth of the thickness

1283
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:50,260
so it can look thin

1284
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:54,560
Then do a tomographic scan, just like this

1285
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,720
A living one like this, this is a living IC package

1286
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,720
it just sweeps over

1287
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,700
We went to see the video, he recorded it

1288
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:06,420
After recording it, he reconstructed it from measurements

1289
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:08,920
Different directions to rebuild, like this

1290
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,920
Here's the actual architecture of his experiment

1291
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,440
Two object paths, actually there are three object paths here

1292
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:16,440
There are actually

1293
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,980
As you can see, this is a

1294
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,520
cancer cell

1295
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,260
It's a real-time motion image, a fluorescent image

1296
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,220
the background looks very dark

1297
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:35,020
so it looks very clear

1298
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:37,960
The contrast is very good

1299
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,220
images like this

1300
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,880
he did a lot

1301
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,180
I can't report to everyone one by one.

1302
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:49,220
Because it involves a lot of research

1303
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:52,580
basic biology, and some

1304
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,580
pharmacology, and some other reactions

1305
01:13:56,580 --> 01:14:00,200
Then I have selected a few to compare

1306
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,020
simple

1307
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,600
You can see this at the bottom left

1308
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,940
The first one is an image of the nucleus

1309
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:11,020
The second is the image of this solid

1310
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:15,100
It is the image of generating ATP to generate energy

1311
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,900
This is the same cell

1312
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:21,000
And this is the image of the inner fat network

1313
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,340
That is, it can distinguish between different proteins

1314
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,940
Individual images can then be extracted

1315
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,760
and put it together like this

1316
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,880
Then it places different slices at different depths

1317
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,420
it can see its

1318
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,200
instant dynamic response

1319
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:42,500
different location

1320
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:47,620
So put it all together and you can see the change of its overall image

1321
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,660
this is

1322
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,720
one depends on the present

1323
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,260
very important

1324
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,300
The development of optical technology

1325
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,860
And computer big data processing

1326
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,160
And there is the image

1327
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
Some techniques for rebuilding

1328
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,200
can see very important

1329
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,840
This is a T cell

1330
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,960
After he found a foreign cell

1331
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,440
he opened his mouth

1332
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,200
then swallow it

1333
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,440
This is an image showing no foreign cells seen

1334
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,480
just see it

1335
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,640
Then you can see the mouth open

1336
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,480
then he swallowed it

1337
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:26,120
Some movies of some important some cells like this

1338
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,080
is his specialty

1339
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,800
This is just in the T cell

1340
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,200
when you want to open your mouth to swallow it

1341
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:38,880
When he opens his mouth, some acidic substances will be produced

1342
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:41,000
then lyse the cells

1343
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,640
swallow it up

1344
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,920
This word is the same cell

1345
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:48,720
look at it from different directions

1346
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,720
So you can see that this cell divides in the middle

1347
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,600
Then split successfully

1348
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,080
and then become two different individuals

1349
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,760
That

1350
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:10,980
This is a kind of Hila-Sel, which is the kind of cancer cells of uterine well cancer

1351
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:17,340
It has no way to successfully split in the process of splitting, entangled together

1352
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:21,740
That is, the cells have no ability to regenerate.

1353
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:28,260
That is, after it is treated with drugs, it will not regenerate, it will only wither

1354
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:33,320
So some images like this can be seen by it

1355
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:43,600
that's a fruit camp one...sorry, it's a live insect egg

1356
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,500
This is the egg of a living insect, the green one you see now is its chromosome

1357
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,860
it is undergoing nuclear division of this cell

1358
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:57,940
So the following is the fruit camp

1359
01:16:57,940 --> 01:16:59,940
This is the egg of the fruit camp

1360
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,420
Sure enough, the soft cell membrane

1361
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:03,580
you can see

1362
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:06,260
it's been squeezing each other

1363
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:14,160
How does its extruding cells extrude and harden?

1364
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,160
In fact it has always been a puzzle

1365
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,640
How do these mechanical effects arise

1366
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,400
In fact it is not clear

1367
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,960
This is the first time you can see so clearly

1368
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:27,680
A change like this on its cell membrane

1369
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,720
This is the heart of a zebrafish three-day-old baby zebrafish

1370
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,440
The heart of this zebrafish

1371
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,880
You can see that is to say

1372
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,280
about this size

1373
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,680
About 50 to 100micron heart

1374
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:50,400
Then it also moves with the cardiomyocytes

1375
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,520
The orange part represents the nucleus

1376
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,920
The green part is the cytoplasm

1377
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,000
So you can clearly see

1378
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
entire

1379
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,900
From cell to heart

1380
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,100
and then what else

1381
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:12,200
This is a mouse brain neuron

1382
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,300
this is the nucleus

1383
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:18,200
Then this branch is the nerve cell's

1384
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,800
one by one nerve

1385
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,200
Then he can see clearly

1386
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:24,300
Of course this is processed

1387
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,000
After transparent processing

1388
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
This is before processing, this is after processing

1389
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,800
Then you can see the brain cells go deep inside some of the

1390
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,800
The last one you can see is

1391
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,000
his technique

1392
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,800
Fluorescence Microscopy

1393
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,700
so-called

1394
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,800
Sad disease like this tomographic technique

1395
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,900
actually very very important

1396
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,900
His Science of Paper last year

1397
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,600
Selected as one of the Science for a whole year

1398
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,300
most important articles

1399
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,200
Then he gets Science

1400
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,300
there is a very important

1401
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
It's called the Newcombe Cleveland Award

1402
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
This award has been around for more than eighty years

1403
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Eighty years ago it was Newcombe Cleveland

1404
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Their family donated a sum of money

1405
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
eighty years ago

1406
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
His prize money is one thousand dollars

1407
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Eighty years ago, one thousand yuan was a lot

1408
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So there was a

1409
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Soulland dollars award

1410
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
is the highest award

1411
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
It is the highest award of AAAS in the United States and Science magazine

1412
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
So in February this year, during the Lunar New Year

1413
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Everyone celebrates the New Year here and he flew to New York to receive the award

1414
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,000
We had a lot of bad news in the hospital

1415
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
So the good news was never reported.

1416
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
OK good

1417
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The remaining time is now eight nineteen

1418
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
not much time left

1419
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Then I will report to you

1420
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
something else

1421
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,300
it's more interesting

1422
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,300
In fact, there are many interesting things

1423
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,600
I have limited time to share

1424
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,900
My personal knowledge is also limited

1425
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:12,200
So I thought I'd make some comparisons

1426
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,600
interesting things i find

1427
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,200
Because a reporter came to me and asked me

1428
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,200
The invisibility cloak is not a dream

1429
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,600
that Berkeley professor

1430
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,800
it was last september

1431
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:28,400
Many major newspapers in Taiwan published it

1432
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
say this

1433
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,000
the most important thing is to say

1434
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Ask Zhang Xiang if this invisibility cloak is real

1435
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,500
Professor Zhang Xiang said I can't see any obstacles

1436
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,000
Many people came to me and asked

1437
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Isn't that what you do?

1438
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,500
what is that obstacle

1439
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,500
why can't i see

1440
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,000
this is a joke

1441
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
because of the invisibility cloak

1442
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
so can't see

1443
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:59,000
This is actually a very important development

1444
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,460
How to tell this story?

1445
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:06,640
That is to say, Professor Zhang Qiang published this Size Paper last year

1446
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,940
Then this Size Paper will tell you

1447
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:14,360
Suppose you make some special artificial structures on a surface

1448
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,340
These artificial structures allow incoming light

1449
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:22,440
Follow your ideas to the direction you want him to go

1450
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,940
that's all

1451
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,100
So what if I make an invisibility cloak

1452
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,560
It's easy for you to lose sight of me

1453
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,760
I just let the light in

1454
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,960
Then run to the back

1455
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,260
you can't see me

1456
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:41,060
Then the light went to the back and that's it

1457
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,260
So what about his experiment?

1458
01:21:45,260 --> 01:21:50,560
That is to say that on a surface with bumps and bumps

1459
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:54,040
I went to lay out a lot of structures that are resistant to you

1460
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,040
make him look flat

1461
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,040
This is what his experiment looks like

1462
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,840
So it turns out that this is where RO stands out

1463
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,340
looks wrinkled

1464
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:10,020
but i'm up there now

1465
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,360
put some nanostructures

1466
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,300
it looks flat to me

1467
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,800
it is flat

1468
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,880
that's it

1469
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,080
So this concept is very important

1470
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,720
So if you ask me

1471
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,400
There are various versions of this story

1472
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,760
I won't talk much

1473
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,800
Size's cover is an invisibility cloak

1474
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,960
then very important

1475
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,720
I still want to tell this story a little bit.

1476
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,620
The story develops over a period of time

1477
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:44,200
about 10 years

1478
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:49,200
That is to say, 10 years ago, some people proposed that

1479
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:53,200
Matter is made up of atoms and molecules

1480
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,440
Assuming that humans can make artificial atoms and molecules

1481
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,320
to form a substance

1482
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,080
called

1483
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,400
Metal material, Metal means

1484
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,800
Walking up means above, beyond

1485
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,500
So human technology

1486
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,800
Nanotechnology has developed to the present

1487
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,700
materials that can be made

1488
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,900
Because artificial atoms have to have structure

1489
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:22,200
So these artificial atoms and the size of the molecule

1490
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,900
Can't be as small as an atom

1491
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,700
Because its most basic composition is the atomic molecule

1492
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,700
Right, so it's always slightly bigger than an atomic molecule

1493
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,800
But it must be more visible than us humans

1494
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,700
The wavelength that can be seen like this comes from a small

1495
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:42,800
to do something interesting

1496
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,900
So a structure like this

1497
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:50,600
It affects physical properties that humans care about

1498
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:54,900
Basically the two coefficients of electricity and magnetism

1499
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:57,600
The two coefficients of electricity and magnetism

1500
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,700
natural material

1501
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Its electric and magnetic coefficients are composed of atoms and molecules

1502
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,240
Influence

1503
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:11,040
The physical properties of electricity and magnetism in artificial structures

1504
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,840
are influenced by these artificial small structures

1505
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:21,180
To have an impact you have to put what comes in

1506
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:25,280
Changes in what is measured will have an impact

1507
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,680
otherwise it won't work

1508
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,300
right

1509
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:31,300
So these things you have to go through a special design

1510
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,900
So at that time, many people jumped in to do such an experiment.

1511
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,300
Including materials responsible for setting up

1512
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:41,100
is everything before

1513
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,580
This is how light goes

1514
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:43,500
Refractive index

1515
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:45,500
it goes the other way

1516
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,300
Then everyone used to walk on the right

1517
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,700
it keeps to the left

1518
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:51,300
that anyway

1519
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:52,600
something like it

1520
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,800
But later found a difficulty

1521
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,100
That is, if it's really efficient

1522
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,900
that comes in quickly

1523
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,680
If you want to have an effect with him, after it has an effect, the ones behind will have no effect with him.

1524
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,900
Because everything was done by his predecessor

1525
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,820
So after a few years, ten years

1526
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:14,860
Started with some smart ones like

1527
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,100
CAPASO, Professor, Department of Applied Physics, Harvard University

1528
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:20,780
He said, let's not work so hard

1529
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:24,700
Because making that Metameteria requires artificial atoms and artificial molecules

1530
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:28,660
To do it well, one by one, to do it well for many years

1531
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,280
So we just make a thin layer

1532
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,040
Anyway, only the first few layers work.

1533
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,160
So it's called Metameteria Surface

1534
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:40,000
We focus on Metameteria Surface

1535
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,680
Metameteria Surface as long as the efficiency is good enough

1536
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:47,740
Soon you can complete the artificial substance you want

1537
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:51,840
So he proposed to use this V-shaped

1538
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:56,100
Nanostructures of something like a boomerang

1539
01:25:56,100 --> 01:26:00,040
To control the electromagnetic wave or light that enters the color

1540
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
It hits this entry above each dot

1541
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,500
After it interacts with it, it will produce different items

1542
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:12,000
ok, i'm sorry, there's no way to not give the formula at all

1543
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
So let me talk about

1544
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:20,000
When you were in junior high school, you learned that entering the character role is equal to the anti-role role

1545
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Snees Law, Snees Law

1546
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
N1, Sci-Ct-1 is equal to N2, Sci-Ct-2

1547
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
So look at the fish in the water in the air

1548
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
The position of the fish will be different from its real position

1549
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Because of the folding angle

1550
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Because water has a different refractive index than air, right?

1551
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,000
that description is correct

1552
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
But that water has to be pretty flat

1553
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
If the water surface is uneven, if the interface is uneven

1554
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
is a structured word

1555
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It is necessary to put the contribution of this structure in

1556
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
so without it

1557
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:09,920
So capasso wrote the so-called generized snare's law

1558
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:15,040
Generalized, extensive snare's law

1559
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,320
That is to say, one more contribution is the contribution generated by the surface

1560
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:24,720
There is one more item from reflection or refraction.

1561
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:31,440
This is one more item, he won the highest award of the International Society for Conceptual Engineering

1562
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,920
The Optical Society of America's highest award

1563
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,360
And iQIPOE's highest award

1564
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,360
It's because of this extra item

1565
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,860
so very important

1566
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:44,840
Ask me if it's simple, very simple

1567
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,320
but he just wrote it out

1568
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,760
With this concept

1569
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,480
Many people do related research

1570
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,120
We also did some research

1571
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,280
What we do is the so-called full photo

1572
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,840
General full photo like your credit card

1573
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:09,340
Or those full photos that you see at art museums

1574
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:13,140
We are in every pixel of every full photo

1575
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:15,640
This is a single pixel

1576
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,240
Put different nanostructures inside

1577
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,840
the nanostructure

1578
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,840
One is NTU, the other is RCAAS

1579
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,940
Then it goes in a different direction

1580
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,280
If the direction is different

1581
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:32,280
The images you get in and out with different polarized light are different.

1582
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,280
then you ask me

1583
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,280
what's the fun in that

1584
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:38,780
that is to tell you

1585
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,480
In fact, the previous polarized full photo

1586
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,980
Only one image can be projected

1587
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:48,280
There is no biased information in that image.

1588
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,780
We can now be inside a pixel

1589
01:28:50,780 --> 01:28:52,780
also contains biased messages

1590
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:55,280
That is to say, the original image

1591
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,280
it is intensity

1592
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:59,280
also in different colors

1593
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,620
There are different information

1594
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:06,120
So we now add one more dimension

1595
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:10,180
It is an additional dimension of information

1596
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:12,680
Then you ask me, can I add more?

1597
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:13,820
sure

1598
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:15,480
if you have the ability

1599
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:19,900
It will change from three-dimensional to four-dimensional to five-dimensional to multi-dimensional

1600
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:23,700
Multidimensional information is placed in a Single Pixel

1601
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:28,160
As long as you can design some nanostructures like this

1602
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,780
so you can control

1603
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:33,960
Is it projected to be NTU or projected to be RCA

1604
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,880
It can also project on both sides simultaneously

1605
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:38,660
It has something to do with the polarized direction of your colored light

1606
01:29:38,660 --> 01:29:41,560
that this is very interesting stuff

1607
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,160
Then after we develop these things

1608
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,760
That's because it's targeting a wavelength

1609
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,920
Later we also developed RGB

1610
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,280
Different wavelengths are broadband

1611
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,920
Full Spectrum Different Colors

1612
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:59,920
All can be applied to a full photo of a nanometer like this

1613
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,460
Then this is the result of it

1614
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:05,960
Then you ask me, what is the use of having these things?

1615
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:07,120
Of course useful

1616
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:08,960
You may not know

1617
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:13,440
about fifty or sixty years ago

1618
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:16,120
After the Second and Fourth Four Seasons War

1619
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:20,680
A very famous large pharmaceutical company in Europe

1620
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:24,520
when it is making a medicine

1621
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,640
Everyone knows that medicine is

1622
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,720
After knowing that a certain molecule is useful

1623
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:30,960
just synthesize it

1624
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,600
But during the synthesis

1625
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,880
that molecular weight is the same

1626
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,680
but it is mirrored

1627
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,200
its two mirror images

1628
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,200
Those two mirror images are just right

1629
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,120
this left hand

1630
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:42,920
this kind

1631
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,440
Right hand

1632
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,640
open me

1633
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,440
This one is Left hand

1634
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:49,320
one is sorry

1635
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,040
One is Right hand

1636
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:50,880
One is Left hand

1637
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,640
Then what

1638
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:53,000
Just right for its medicinal properties

1639
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,880
Chemical properties are different

1640
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,600
so what

1641
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,120
There are many of these

1642
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,120
After the sick woman took the medicine

1643
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,400
Babies born without hands

1644
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:04,900
no hands

1645
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:08,600
Well, this matter was actually not settled until the lawsuit was settled three years ago.

1646
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:18,800
A total of nearly 5 million pounds of this money was paid to these victims

1647
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,500
and the victims who are still alive

1648
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:25,200
What about the drug Salidome?

1649
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,500
This drug was actually a very important drug in the past

1650
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,800
That is because in the process of treatment

1651
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:38,000
Neglected that the medicinal properties of the left hand and the right hand are different

1652
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,600
Hence the aftermath

1653
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:45,100
Then you ask me how do you detect the left hand and right hand

1654
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,300
that's really troublesome

1655
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,000
Your change means that you want to synthesize this medicine after

1656
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
to separate it

1657
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,700
how do you detect

1658
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,300
Even if you take it apart today

1659
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,000
do you worry

1660
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,900
Then you will say that I will melt it in the water

1661
01:31:58,900 --> 01:31:59,900
and then use

1662
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,600
This different left-handed off right-handed off to hit it

1663
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,440
Then look out the result

1664
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,400
But the results you see need a lot of molecules to have an effect

1665
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:14,880
So is there any way to detect instantly

1666
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,480
Left Hand circular police and Y hand circular police came out

1667
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,800
You can go to different points by typing it out

1668
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,920
Because we use Laimi's technology

1669
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,080
So we can have a very small range

1670
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,400
We can do something like this with very little

1671
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,240
So we can do a very efficient

1672
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,960
and very fast filtering

1673
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,960
Just to do a meta analyzer like this

1674
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:47,800
It is the use of this meta surface technology to do the meta analyzer just mentioned

1675
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,440
This article was recently accepted for publication

1676
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:58,280
So with this structure of Laimi in different directions

1677
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,880
Different bias control

1678
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,800
Polarized in a different direction, since it is found that it will project onto this point

1679
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,400
or projected to this point, depending on its polarization

1680
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:11,600
Then its polarization is after interacting with this substance

1681
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,600
what does its polarization look like

1682
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,600
ok, then this me

1683
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,400
What about our students, so

1684
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,400
Just taught by Carposo

1685
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,400
Project Maxima, recruited to his laboratory

1686
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,400
Then he is in this year's

1687
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,900
June 3 cover

1688
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:30,100
Just made a Metal Lens

1689
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,100
that is a lens

1690
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:35,100
Because all photos are very complicated, an image needs to be projected

1691
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,100
Then when he went, he said, what are you doing?

1692
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,100
Do Metal Hologram

1693
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:41,100
You say Metal Hologram, don't bother

1694
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,100
Just project on a point

1695
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:46,100
So before projecting as an image

1696
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,100
Projected at a point, it is called Metal Lens

1697
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,100
So now this student is called Chen Weiting

1698
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,100
he did very well

1699
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:55,100
Then this year he published an article

1700
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,100
Size Fondant, called Metal Lens

1701
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:00,100
Then, take the H of Harvard

1702
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,120
see clearly

1703
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:09,620
And now he is helping Apple, Google and the three sacred companies every day

1704
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:13,240
Because they all signed him up to buy the technology

1705
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:17,080
To replace what? To replace the lens of this phone

1706
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:23,380
So the last few slides

1707
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:29,760
That is to say, from the past, human beings invented

1708
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,640
Various nanostructures

1709
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,720
then through conversion optics

1710
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:39,160
Can make this raised thing look like it's not raised

1711
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,880
just pretending to be flat

1712
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:47,040
Then you can make adjustments

1713
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,800
convertible

1714
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,400
To the so-called Meta Device

1715
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,840
That is, many devices or components in the future

1716
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:59,280
Just use it directly, it is done in this nano way

1717
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,040
will be

1718
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,140
We consider a very important development in optics

1719
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:11,260
The reason is because optics is a science that controls the path of light

1720
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:14,600
Or a study of the interaction between light and matter

1721
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:18,940
Finally, I want to show you a video

1722
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:21,760
Because many reporters asked me

1723
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:27,640
How do you feel about what Professor Zhang made?

1724
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:32,500
I dare not speak because I respect Professor Zhang very much

1725
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:36,860
He is the chairman of our middle academic information committee

1726
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:40,700
I worked for three years

1727
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,540
Then I thought of a solution

1728
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,320
I found this slide

1729
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,120
This slideshow is made by me

1730
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,420
I went out of my way to find this movie

1731
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
use your skin to change color and texture.

1732
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
There's some algae in the foreground and an octopus.

1733
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Isn't that amazing?

1734
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Now Roger spooked him so he took off with a cloud of ink,

1735
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
lands, and when he lands the octopus says,

1736
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I've been seen best thing to do is get as big as I can get.

1737
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
That big brown makes his eye spot very big.

1738
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
So he's bluffing, let's do it backwards.

1739
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I thought he was joking when he first showed it,

1740
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I thought it was all graphics.

1741
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So here it is in reverse.

1742
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Watch the skin color, watch the skin texture,

1743
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
just an amazing animal can change color and texture

1744
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
to match the surroundings.

1745
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Watch them blend right into this algae.

1746
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
One, two, three.

1747
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Now he's gone and so am I.

1748
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Pattern, color, whiteness, and texture.

1749
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,500
Actually I have many, many videos

1750
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,500
I just choose one

1751
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,500
That Zhang Yu, you dropped him out of the sea

1752
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,500
As soon as he arrives at the fake version, his eyes will see the color of your fake version

1753
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,000
His color is exactly the same as the counterfeit color

1754
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,500
change in seconds

1755
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,500
he changes the color

1756
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,500
how does that color change

1757
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,000
Did you say pigment? Not quite

1758
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
including his wrinkles

1759
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,500
including the structures above the skin

1760
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
his eyes are ring shaped

1761
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
his circular vision

1762
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
After taking the photo, he will fully blend in with the situation around him.

1763
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
So I can tell you about this

1764
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
In fact, this world already has such

1765
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
tunable, adjustable

1766
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
reconfigurable, reconfigurable

1767
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Some creatures like this exist

1768
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:58,000
Then why can't there be man-made

1769
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Such a structure exists

1770
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,360
Sure, just say how much it will cost you

1771
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,080
So I answered the reporter and said

1772
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:10,720
An invisibility cloak I know I'm hard at work 100micron by 100micron

1773
01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:14,560
An invisibility cloak, say 1 meter by 1 meter

1774
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,440
It might take me 1000 times the paper to finish

1775
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,840
With current time and technology

1776
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,360
But you said it's possible, of course it's possible

1777
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,520
The world's most famous Southampton UK

1778
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:32,240
The University of Southampton is the most famous school in optoelectronics in the world

1779
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:35,920
They published the so-called Tunable

1780
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,120
Some structures like this have been published

1781
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:42,960
And there is Professor Hedge in Germany

1782
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,880
They have also developed a variety of mechanical or electronically controlled

1783
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,120
or thermodynamic heat induction

1784
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:55,440
Our laboratory has also done some

1785
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:58,560
People are doing Pingtang

1786
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,560
The area of ​​Pingtang is very high
