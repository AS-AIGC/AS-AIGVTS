This video is to celebrate the 130th anniversary of the birth of Dean Zhu Jiahua. Distinguished Chair Professor Li Dingguo shares his deep friendship with Dean Zhu and his mental journey of physics research. The content of the lecture explores the properties of elements and emergent phenomena, such as superconductivity and collective phenomena of brain nerves. Academician Li pointed out that the Cooper pair is the key to the formation of superconductivity. The film also mentions the Jansen phenomenon (Messner effect) interacting with superconductors and magnetic fields, and its typical applications. Research directions can be divided into top-down and bottom-up strategies. In addition, the field of high-temperature superconductor research is quite important and complex, and new discoveries are made every year. In the film, the speaker also mentioned flock behavior models and brain neuron research, as well as the emergence of new behaviors and activities in sociological research. Finally, issues such as neuronal thresholds and free radicals are explored, noting that nature works surprisingly well. This video explores the generation of new phenomena by increasing force strength and system complexity, and mentions last year's Nobel Prize-winning work on the spin-glass model. The speaker emphasized that nature can provide its own solutions and discussed chain reactions in life sciences. The film mainly talks about the problem of critical phenomena and explores three related questions. Although the answers are not easy to find, it points out that physicists need real data for analysis. In addition, the speaker discussed the phenomenon of superconductivity and the generation of Cooper Pair coherence, and mentioned that future superconductors may operate at higher temperatures. This presentation covers the relevance of energy issues to social development and introduces knowledge of group and emerging behaviors. ,
