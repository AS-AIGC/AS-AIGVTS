2018 Governor's Banquet, Science Popularization Lectures and Speakers in October

32
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
We ask the Director of No Impulse of the Secretariat of the Court to host for us

33
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,800
Okay, thank you all colleagues present

34
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,400
Or interested in popular science

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,200
There is still a little drizzle outside in this early autumn season

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Still willing to take off the tired mood after a day of work

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,500
I am also willing to come to the Institute of Chinese Studies to listen to lectures on popular science

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,200
Today's speech is given by the deputy director of our Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,500
Researcher Wang Xiangyu, who is also the deputy director

40
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,800
he came to give a keynote speech

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,700
The eyes of astronomers who make astronomers

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,800
The development of Jianduan astronomy

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
What about Mr. Wang, he and I are in fact the black hole this time

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,280
because of the black hole

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,800
So have more close interaction with him

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,360
He is a very personable, very gentle person

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,960
I took a closer look at his profile

48
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,880
He himself graduated from the Institute of Electronics of our Jiaotong University

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,960
After he graduated with a Ph.D.

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,760
joined our newly established

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,640
Astronomical Institute of Astrophysics

52
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,040
Currently a researcher and deputy director of our astronomical institute

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,600
he is central university

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,280
He is also an adjunct professor at the Central Space Science Institute

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,800
and director of the East Asia Observatory

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,000
His research specialization was developed in Astronomical Rituals

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,400
small solar system bodies

58
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,040
Infrared detection

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,480
dendrite gold

60
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,600
The teacher told me that I don't know what astronomical Shulei gold is

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,080
his research looks real

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,040
really great

63
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,840
It is currently the only one in the astronomical institute

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,200
Personnel who can engage in the development of visible light and infrared rays

65
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,680
Dominated four international telescopes over the years

66
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,000
Instrument R&D Equipment

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
It is also a Sino-US acting project

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200
And one of the hosts of the Neptune Celestial Show Mind Project

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,640
It conducts research on the evolution history of the solar system

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,840
At the same time participated in the research and development of Japanese scientific satellites

71
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,240
Also completed research globe

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,200
Electron Analyzer of the Magnetosphere

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
To be fair I don't even know what that means.

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,880
But we may ask Mr. Wang to explain later

75
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
it is currently leading a team

76
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,280
Entering the Next Generation of Infrared Space Telescopes

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,400
and the future world's largest

78
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,040
Instrument development for the European Visible Light Telescope

79
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
And hope to expand Taiwan astronomy

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,720
Opportunity to participate in state-of-the-art observing equipment

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It also assists domestic manufacturers

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Build an automated large area detector

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There is also a system for camera detection

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hopefully these astronomical instruments will resolve

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not just about seeing the sky

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It can also solve our current domestic industry

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
domestic and foreign industries

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
all the problems

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and create some possible business opportunities

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a little bit windy outside today

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
english fat

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But if you are interested

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know everyone last Saturday

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Have you ever come to see go away open

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Everyone can also go to the Humanities Museum

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the stairs

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
can see us a black hole

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This year is our Central Plains

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
a very important year

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Our team in Taiwan and the world

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
we found

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Black hole photographed for the first time

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
confirmed the black hole

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you look carefully

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's actually very, very difficult

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
if you look at it now

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that picture looks

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
not very clear

109
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,380
Then I was last Saturday

110
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
I just heard

111
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,240
How difficult is it to photograph that black hole?

112
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,760
after everyone listened

113
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,920
I just discovered my admiration for that Teacher Wang

114
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,420
deep in my heart

115
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
how difficult that is

116
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,320
As you can imagine, it's probably from New York

117
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,120
to see in los angeles

118
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,300
a golf ball

119
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
a small groove on the top

120
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
You can imagine how difficult it would be

121
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,300
So it's no wonder we're developing everything so cutting-edge

122
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,300
So let me think about it

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Seeing Los Angeles from New York

124
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
A small groove in a golf ball

125
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
how did it work

126
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Next, we warmly welcome Mr. Wang

127
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
Come help us analyze

128
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
thank you all

129
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Thank you Director

130
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
goodbye

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've actually been playing this video before starting my talk

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Then this is actually everyone's image

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,400
I use this little machine

134
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560
This is the instrument we developed ourselves

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,000
But in fact, this is still far from most astronomical instruments.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,560
This is the one we developed for Zhongshan Science people.

137
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,080
a new chair used on satellites

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,600
it can do very fast tracking

139
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,440
Know the current attitude of my satellite

140
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,160
The current attitude of artificial satellites is a thing for navigation

141
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,280
Then I want to use this small example to tell you

142
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
In addition to astronomical instruments

143
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,520
In fact, there are many other related applications

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,760
Then I will start my speech today

145
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Director Wu just introduced the topic of today's speech

146
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,960
introduce everyone

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,440
Have some knowledge about the astronomical instruments behind the development of it

148
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,640
Where is its application and its difficulty

149
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,240
in this first page

150
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
In fact, I put a picture of the moon

151
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,800
This photo of the moon was actually taken by my daughter

152
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,520
She took a digital camera

153
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,960
It's the fried moon

154
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,840
just push it down

155
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,880
Then you will see full image

156
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,520
In fact, the current technology is honestly very advanced.

157
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
So in fact, many times

158
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,320
If you are looking for a place to construct a case

159
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,920
You go to the right place in the sky to shoot

160
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,440
you can shoot this

161
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,600
It's still a very beautiful image of the Milky Way

162
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,640
then you may think

163
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,040
Hey, since you can just go and buy a digital camera

164
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,440
You just shot it so well

165
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,040
So why do you want the school to do it yourself?

166
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,600
I'll just go around and find someone to get my equipment out.

167
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
that's actually

168
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,040
I also said today that I hope that after listening to

169
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
just talk about why

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,780
We have to spend so much effort on the development of astronomical instruments

171
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Mainly there are very main reasons why we have to do it ourselves

172
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,280
It's just that you can't buy it

173
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,940
Because you can find these cameras in the market

174
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,740
or imaging systems, in fact, they are all fixed specifications

175
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,580
But we astronomers special binoculars

176
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,080
In fact, they all have different designs

177
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,080
So each binocular has its own characteristics

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,080
kind of like your own eyes

179
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,080
If everyone's eyes are short-sighted

180
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
You can't wear someone else's glasses

181
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
so i can see clearly

182
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
The same goes for every binocular, it has its own designed focal length

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,080
In addition to this focal length, it has the so-called phase difference in the system

184
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
so it's hard for you to get between binoculars

185
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm the one who moves this department around

186
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
you can get the same effect

187
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
In addition, in fact, every binocular

188
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
it all wants to have its own character

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Make the best science in the world

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So I'm going to achieve the best of this

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We speak the words of the best potency

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
then i will do it myself

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Of course, another reason is that

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In fact, if you are really rich

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can definitely find Guangshi to do it for you

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's just that most scientists are really poor

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Our funds are usually picked again and again.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So everyone becomes self-developed

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then let the research of this astronomy department

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
become a very special field of study

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
In fact, the whole world

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The person engaged in the development of the first phase of this astronomy

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Maybe it's because we've been in touch so often

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
probably a few thousand

205
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
so it's not a huge area of ​​research

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But it is for the study of astronomy

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
is a very big contribution

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
then this is a photo

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Here's a picture of me taking this thing apart

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
actually tell you

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Presumably there will be something inside an instrument

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will introduce it in detail later

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that this thing because it's small

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is about the smallest thing we've ever made that could easily be brought here

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Basically, the instrument we developed is a big thing

216
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's also very heavy, weighing several tons

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't bring it here for everyone to see

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The main reason why it is necessary to make such a big thing

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
In fact, it has a lot to do with the progress of our human technology.

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Then everyone may be familiar with it

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We are famous in Taiwan for the manufacture of this semiconductor

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There is a well-known motorcycle listening rate in semiconductor manufacturing to tell you

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That is to say, the same area of ​​these chips can carry the number of transistors

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
In fact, its increasing speed is a logarithmic increase in terms of time.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then this law is also applicable if you put it into the astronomy

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Everyone should know that

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
GID slightly 400 years ago

228
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He was the first person to invent net access

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What was the caliber of the net inlet he invented 400 years ago?

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
is only 2 cm

231
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
that passed 400 years

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
right now we

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Visible light network entrance with the largest aperture

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is 10 meters

235
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
maybe later

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's 2019

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
In about five or six years

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There will be one in Europe

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Nearly 40 meters net net entry

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
then this is a

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
a very rapidly growing curve

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So with this astronomical

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The caliber of this net becomes larger

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Then the size of the instrument I need

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
will also get bigger and bigger

246
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Then you may find it a little strange to hear this.

247
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Really?

248
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The largest astronomical network

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is only 10 meters

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We seem to be here all the time

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The explosives will see that China has an eye in the sky

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This sky eye is a 500-meter location

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But this because it is a

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We say that it is suitable for locations with relatively long radio wave fields

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
it's not like what i just said

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
All the things I just said here

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
All visible light

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Then your TRON range is different

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
In fact, your application technology is also different.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So we're basically

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We still have to use the same standard to compare

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
same technique

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's what I was talking about

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
When binoculars get bigger and bigger

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
In fact, scientists still use some small tricks

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That this is the current world

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
arguably the most famous

268
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This CAC binoculars from UC

269
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
it's a 10 meter telescope

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can see that it is not a complete mirror

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
In fact, it has a large

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A lot of hexagons put together

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's because scientists are doing the research and development of the binoculars

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You slowly discovered that I have encountered a technical bottleneck

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,500
If I put the same big single lens

276
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
while slowly expanding its size

277
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,000
I will find it very difficult to make my

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Therefore, modern visible glasses usually use splicing technology

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Hexagonal binoculars about one meter in length

280
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,500
put it together and form it into a larger binoculars

281
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,500
This picture shows the size of the largest binoculars in the world

282
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
with its mirror image

283
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,000
draw it all out

284
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:56,500
It can be found that in the early days, a single lens was used to form my binoculars

285
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
That's about eight meters away.

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
we just stop doing this

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Therefore, all mirrors with a caliber exceeding 8 meters often use this splicing method.

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Use a small regular mirror to go back and forth

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Small lenses come and go to combine into one large lens

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So next in

291
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In the next 10 years, I expect there will be 30-meter class

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Large astronomical mirrors tend to slowly

293
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Join the ranks of this astronomical observation

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Of course these observations

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It requires very sophisticated astronomical instruments

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
so that you can use

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
In order to really put the wide mouth mirror

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Observation ability of the mirror

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
play it out

300
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So advances in observational astronomy

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
In fact, it has a lot to do with the development of astronomical instruments.

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
On the contrary, if you can master the technology of these astronomical instruments

303
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
you can master observation

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Suspect of the Department of Astronomy

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So Central Academy of Astronomy

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
we are at

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When we established the institute more than 20 years ago, we

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Sure

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We are doing science at the same time

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
research and development of the Department of Astronomy

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that in the past twenty years

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We also put a lot of effort into

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to develop

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Improve our astronomy department

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
this ability

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Then I thought about our current

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Scientific achievements are similar to those of our astronomy department

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
developed this

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
result

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It can be said that it matches quite well.

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
pretty good

323
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That

324
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What exactly does an astronomy school want in general?

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Astronomy schools are actually

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Like most scientists

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This signal is actually

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the more the merrier

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So it's better if I can

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
collect all

331
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
from the universe

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
able to reach the earth

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
collect it all at once

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,500
what does it mean to collect well

335
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,800
It doesn't matter which direction you come from

336
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
i can tell

337
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
when did you come to my earth

338
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Then you come here and there are a few trees

339
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Then I also know the energy of each photon

340
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
That is to say, I hope

341
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I can do things that say

342
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,300
I have high resolution

343
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,000
spatial resolution

344
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
time resolution

345
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,500
Then I can measure the light very accurately

346
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,000
And then there's also very high-resolution spectra at the same time

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,500
just know

348
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Hey, this light is red

349
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
this light is blue

350
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
at different points in time

351
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
Each of these different colors of light

352
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
how to hit earth

353
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,500
like this image

354
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,500
This is a

355
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
First you make the image of Xingyun Neng 31

356
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
So of course astronomers want to say

357
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I just need to take a picture

358
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
I'm not only able to know the inside of this

359
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
how bright everything is

360
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
I can still know

361
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
that goes with the matter

362
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,460
what kind of change

363
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,000
And what kind of this is in it

364
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,900
gas or metal

365
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
or various elements like this

366
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,100
Of course, to achieve this is actually

367
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,500
It's very, very difficult to be honest

368
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,900
Because we know the range of electromagnetic waves

369
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,500
is very very big

370
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,500
is that it can be read from the radio

371
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
all the way to infrared all the way to our visible light

372
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
then to UV

373
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Then to X-ray or even this GaMaRay with shorter wavelength

374
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Those electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths

375
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,800
It brings us a different message

376
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,800
That also means that it is correspondingly

377
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,500
Emitted by this celestial body with different temperatures

378
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
What about the different electromagnetic waves?

379
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,700
Because of its different characteristics

380
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,000
So when you are going to collect these signals

381
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,800
you have to use a different method

382
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,000
So although it is still ideal

383
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I want to say that if I have an ideal this

384
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I know this astronomical instrument once

385
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Hey, what is this calling in?

386
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Gamma Ray or X-Ray or

387
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,100
Visible light or microwave signal

388
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
But actually this is

389
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,600
So far we have not been able to do this

390
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,600
So usually when we develop astronomical instruments,

391
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,100
We'll take the band and separate it

392
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,600
For example, I mostly do

393
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,100
this band

394
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,600
Visible light and infrared

395
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,100
Then some people will do this high-energy

396
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
This detection of S light or Gamma Ray

397
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,200
that astronomical instrument it of course

398
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
After getting these data

399
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,200
it's basically doing analysis

400
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,700
I was just talking about different colors of light

401
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,200
It represents different substances

402
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,700
or different physical properties

403
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,200
Different substances may be

404
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,200
if i go and say

405
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,700
A celestial body emits this spectrum

406
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
There are some absorption lines in the spectrum

407
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Then this absorption line is usually

408
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It means that in my mind and body

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,400
or inside this cloud

410
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,000
are specific to these molecules

411
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Those molecules can make me

412
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
can absorb this

413
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
This light that continuously emerges above

414
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
But continuous emergence also makes sense

415
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,400
The continuous emergence usually has this intensity distribution of its

416
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
tell us yes

417
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
The temperature of this celestial body

418
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
what about besides this

419
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,900
of course i want

420
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,200
I have another method which is

421
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,700
I can go and get this whole full image

422
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,300
or smooth

423
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
The image can get the relative position

424
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,800
every celestial body

425
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,300
Relatively warm position between

426
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,800
then its brightness

427
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Then follow its distribution

428
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,800
Then these can sometimes tell us that

429
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,800
do they belong to the same area

430
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,000
celestial body

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is there some between them

432
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The role of interaction

433
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,500
That light will show us the different substances

434
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,000
its

435
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
scalar size

436
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,900
or temperature

437
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,800
it even you can know it

438
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
distance from our telescope

439
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Because different celestial bodies will have different displacements

440
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because of the Doppler effect

441
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So from the spectrum we can see its distance

442
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Another possibility is that the light that can be excited by it

443
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the direction of its intensification can understand its various environments

444
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And is there any magnetic field distribution near it?

445
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then this is NASA and there is a famous picture

446
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It puts all of NASA's intensification

447
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This view of the entire Milky Way

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Images at different wavelengths draw it

449
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
that can see the Milky Way from high energies all the way down to very low energies

450
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
it actually looks different

451
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's why it's different, of course

452
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Including whether there is something in it that it will absorb

453
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
For example, in visible light, it has a lot of dust

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
will absorb

455
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,340
The signal is at a relatively high-energy position

456
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,940
In fact, it can really emit this high-energy

457
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,540
The source of the signal

458
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,440
Relatively speaking, it is much less than visible light or infrared light.

459
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,940
So scientists have to compare the different wavelengths

460
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,640
Detect this info for us

461
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,440
I just managed to piece together the whole thing.

462
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,840
celestial man, this image of celestial

463
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,840
or to fully know

464
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,840
what happened to it in these places

465
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,340
So what we just said, astronomers need to know

466
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,340
complete this entire electromagnetic wave this

467
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,340
range of this message

468
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,340
But it's a pity we live on the earth

469
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
What about this earth?

470
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,340
One thing that is very important to us is the atmosphere

471
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,840
As for the atmosphere, it is very important to human beings

472
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,340
We have to breathe every day, we need oxygen

473
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,840
In fact, he is...

474
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What about humans?

475
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Of course, it also blocks a lot of things that are harmful to humans.

476
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
This very high energy electromagnetic wave

477
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Of course, for astronomical observations

478
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Does it block a lot

479
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The signal that recently came from the universe to the ground

480
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So generally speaking, observations on the ground

481
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
we only have three bands

482
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's visible light, infrared, and radio.

483
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The signal of these three bands

484
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We can make astronomical observations from the ground

485
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
the lower part

486
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Like most of this

487
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
X-ray or Gamma Ray

488
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
or longer-wavelength infrared rays

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We have to launch Sputnik

490
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
in order to see the impact

491
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
there is no way on the ground

492
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Besides this effect

493
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The atmosphere and the so-called atmospheric labor

494
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
what is that atmospheric labor

495
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Atmospheric labor is

496
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
For example, when the weather is hot

497
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If you see no oil on the road

498
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
There are often things like distorted images that appear

499
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Then this is because of your atmosphere on the surface

500
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
its own uneven temperature

501
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If the temperature is uneven

502
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Its refractive index will be different

503
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
the light will be biased

504
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Then the light is biased

505
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Usually when we look at the stars

506
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that's what we used to sing when we were kids

507
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
twinkle Twinkle Little Star

508
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That day is a little star

509
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
that sparkle

510
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
In fact, it is the astroman who hates the most

511
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That twinkle twinkle sparkle sounds so

512
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
seems very romantic

513
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Actually it's very, very bad for Astroman

514
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
because it

515
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
If you put this twinkle twinkle star

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
high speed video

517
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It looks like this when you look at it

518
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The star is actually running around all the time

519
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Then its point of light is not a

520
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Not a fully focused spot of light

521
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So this creates this point of light on this star

522
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
will be big

523
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
will be much larger than the optical quality we originally designed

524
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Then this deflection has the greatest effect on electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths

525
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So on the ground because we can only see the shortest visible light

526
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's probably a little bit visible in ultraviolet light.

527
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So visible light has the greatest effect

528
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If it is electromagnetic waves like me, this is the image of a black hole

529
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
An electric shuttle with such a long wavelength cannot see this

530
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So we can see images of black holes from the ground

531
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Also because it doesn't have this

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You can get such a high-resolution video

533
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It is also because it does not have the relationship of atmospheric labor

534
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The different wavelength ranges actually look very different

535
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
this is

536
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,000
This is the visible light instrument that you are more likely to be more familiar with.

537
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,040
a camera

538
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,660
But the camera is really big

539
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,860
it is about three meters high

540
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,660
people are there

541
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,960
Then there is a big mirror

542
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,240
lens

543
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,040
Then I take my

544
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,580
this film

545
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,620
It's like my detector is here

546
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
that looks weird

547
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,680
I don't know what it is

548
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,720
This is

549
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,040
Gamma Ray is high energy

550
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,840
This telescope of electromagnetic waves

551
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,620
then why make it like this

552
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,180
He hopes that when these electromagnetic waves come

553
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:29,940
he used very

554
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,000
very low angle

555
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,540
call me this

556
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,060
scattered leaves

557
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,100
Then

558
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,880
let him do this

559
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,440
This scattering at very low angles

560
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,540
Because usually this high-energy electromagnetic wave can easily penetrate

561
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,340
like we shine light

562
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,640
When the same time, the S light is direct

563
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,440
penetrate our body and hit the back

564
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,020
so you only have very high angles

565
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,800
This angle of incidence at very low angles

566
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,860
You want to collect his pick number

567
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,880
so he has a

568
00:25:59,180 --> 00:25:59,900
so weird

569
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,760
This is our GOT receiver for observing black holes

570
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,200
Because it is an electromagnetic wave, a microwave with a very long wave field

571
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,800
So when it arrives, there will usually be a Fee Home in front of it

572
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,400
It's kind of like a horn

573
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,400
There is a natural function that allows electromagnetic waves to converge

574
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,200
So usually in microwave receivers

575
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,800
You'll see something like

576
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
just said so much

577
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,000
In fact, on every temperature platform

578
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
Regardless of which band the weather station

579
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,600
In fact, they all carry a lot of different instruments

580
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,400
I will give two different examples here

581
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,800
One is that these two are binoculars that cooperate with our Tianwen team.

582
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
one is japan

583
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,600
I asked Taiwan about this SUVAR binoculars

584
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,000
what about this

585
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,500
I just listed all the instruments it currently has

586
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,200
look wow

587
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:11,000
one two three four five six seven seven

588
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,000
then it is an eight meter telescope

589
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,300
then this is the real photo

590
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,500
my real photo

591
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,300
It is difficult for you to understand why it can hold so many at once

592
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
that's actually because

593
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,500
it has several focal points in this telescope

594
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,200
several that is to say

595
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
i have a primary mirror

596
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,700
What about the light in space?

597
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,200
After reaching my primary mirror

598
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,000
I can image right where the main focus is

599
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,800
I can make a camera right here

600
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,000
For example, this wide-angle mirrorable light camera is placed here

601
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,000
Then I have another imaging method

602
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,000
That's when I replaced this camera with a lens and another lens

603
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,800
Then my signal will go to my this

604
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,000
we are called

605
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
cover in green focus , another focus

606
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
So it can also put other instruments here

607
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Usually these two instruments usually have different resolutions

608
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The resolution of the main focus instrument will be better than this

609
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
In this cover forest focus, the one above is slightly worse

610
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
In addition, there are two platforms on both sides of it

611
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
How to use two flat platforms

612
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That is, I put this in the middle of the light input and add another mirror

613
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
we're going to have a third mirror

614
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The third mirror is when my light hits the trail and after my second mirror

615
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Then hit this third mirror, which can make my light go to both sides

616
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
what is the advantage of going both ways

617
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It is on these two platforms

618
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
The instruments on it will not move with the telescope

619
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
is suitable for very high-resolution observations

620
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So on a binoculars, you can see that there are many

621
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,400
different this instrument

622
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,900
If these instruments are carefully analyzed

623
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,400
i use different color words

624
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,900
put some emphasis on it

625
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
Look, visible light, visible light, visible light

626
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Infrared ray Golden outer ray Infrared ray Medium yellow outer ray

627
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Representatives say different instruments

628
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,100
You are usually related to its wavelength

629
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,900
because of the different wavelengths

630
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,800
you need to use different

631
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,300
Mainly different detectors

632
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,100
Also its lens is different

633
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,000
So usually you an instrument

634
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It will only be suitable for a fixed wavelength range

635
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
It has no way to cover very large range

636
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This is what we basically

637
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Limitations of our materials

638
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Material limitations of my shots

639
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and the material constraints of my detector

640
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
In addition, the biggest difference is

641
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
many are cameras

642
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Some can be cameras and can also be used as spectrum camps

643
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Usually if you want to high-resolution spectrum

644
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,900
it can only see

645
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It scatters the light of the celestial body very widely

646
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
let you get more of this

647
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
There is this information about its elements and its speed

648
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So what about the spectrometer?

649
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Usually it's different from the camera

650
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It is equal to two different things separated

651
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That's why it can be a camera at the same time

652
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
cannot be spectrum

653
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Usually that's when you're doing this revealing design

654
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You need to use your brains a little bit

655
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
For example, I am a moving thing

656
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
After I plug this thing in

657
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
it turns from camera to spectrum

658
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Such a form to achieve this multi-purpose instrument

659
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Another example is

660
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Another word of our cooperation

661
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Already called JCNT

662
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
it's a radio

663
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the radio binoculars

664
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
the radio binoculars

665
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
it has four different astronomical instruments

666
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
on top of the same binoculars

667
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
it's actually the same

668
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
it will have a mirror to fold

669
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
When mirrors are folded in different directions

670
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
my different astronomical instruments

671
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
can play its role

672
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
what does it have on it

673
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
it's the same camera planner

674
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I got a weird thing here

675
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
extrapolation receiver

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
This thing is actually in Chinese, I was also the day before

677
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
while doing this translation

678
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I just found out that it's called an external receiver.

679
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
English is called Hitrodai

680
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Receiver

681
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
it's actually a

682
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Can know the recent

683
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
this phase of light

684
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
A receiver for the phase of electromagnetic waves

685
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
it usually has a reference

686
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Reference electromagnetic waves come in

687
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
follow me from space

688
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
this signal from

689
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
interfere

690
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,240
Usually you have two signal cell waves with the same wavelength

691
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,600
when interfering

692
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,000
If you know the phase of a battery wave

693
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
you can know another phase

694
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,000
So they have something like this

695
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Of course on a cordless phone headset

696
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,600
It also has astronomical instruments like a normal camera

697
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,800
In this case, it has many wavelengths

698
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Scoobatux is currently the world's most powerful observation

699
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
this radio camera

700
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,400
It provides 450 and 850 micron images

701
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,000
450 microns is just short of our visible light

702
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,800
about 1000 times the wavelength

703
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,600
Our eyes see red light at about 0.6 microns

704
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,200
So this is about 1000 times worse

705
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
so their instruments

706
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
When designing, it uses the same materials as ordinary visible light

707
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The materials used will be different

708
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Then there will be a big difference

709
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So usually when we do training

710
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
For example, I specialize in visible light infrared

711
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's hard for me to have this technology with those radios at the same time

712
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So in our astronomical institute

713
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We basically split into two big groups

714
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
One is visible light and infrared light

715
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Also do this

716
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Development of everything related to black hole radio

717
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Well, what is the difference between everything in astronomy and science in general?

718
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
We know there are actually many different research units in the House of Representatives

719
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
There are many with 31

720
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Then 20 of these 31 firms probably

721
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,960
In fact, there are many, many instruments in the tree pear group and the life science group.

722
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,160
So what is the difference between these instruments and our astronomical instruments?

723
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,760
Probably these three points

724
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,920
is the first

725
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,760
There is no way to control what astronomy observes

726
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,400
and it's far away

727
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,600
So its signal is quite weak when it reaches the earth

728
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,080
there are of course few exceptions

729
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,880
For example, if I want to look at the sun

730
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,560
the sun is actually very, very bright

731
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,760
Our usual nighttime instrument

732
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,280
Once placed in the sun, it burns immediately

733
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
the whole thing is broken

734
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,760
So in the field of astronomical instruments

735
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,160
Being the sun is actually a very special

736
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,440
What they need to consider is also very different from that of ordinary astronomical instruments used at night

737
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,800
But most astronomical instruments still target this very weak signal

738
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,560
to do

739
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,320
to make this design

740
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Because this design needs to detect this very small signal

741
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So what it needs is a very quiet environment

742
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that's usually in physics because what we think of as a quiet environment

743
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Just let the temperature of this thing drop down

744
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Especially this detector of yours

745
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
So everyone, do you all have cell phones?

746
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Mobile phones can take pictures

747
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Like the videos of Xiuwa when I first started

748
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
it's also very beautiful

749
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
These beautiful images have actually been processed.

750
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It didn't look so pretty in the first place

751
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
If that is astronomical, we will lower the operating temperature of the camera to

752
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
at least minus 100 degrees

753
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
What about when you get to minus 100 degrees?

754
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the pictures you took

755
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
to be very clean

756
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But I'll give some examples later

757
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I said it was very clean

758
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But it's actually relative

759
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Actually it looks very ugly

760
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
If you haven't dealt with

761
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
but can't stand it

762
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Another characteristic of silverware after that day is that

763
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It usually operates around the clock

764
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
i put a telescope

765
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Tin Hau silverware placed on top of the mountain

766
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
What about this mountain?

767
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
we need to

768
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There are observation plans every day

769
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
These observation plans are usually decided half a year ago

770
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
just if i'm going to go ahead with tonight's plan

771
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Actually scientists

772
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Should have been six months ago or earlier

773
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
put forward his observation plan

774
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That came up with some censored work

775
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So about three months ago

776
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
what to observe every day

777
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
This observation plan has been fixed

778
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
then this i have

779
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
so here comes the day

780
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
if it's my turn i hope this telescope is good

781
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
this silverware is good

782
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
if it breaks i'm

783
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I am the opportunity to go public

784
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Then I may have to wait another half a year for this

785
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Opportunity to observe

786
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So our observed

787
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Stability requirements are very, very high

788
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Which weather station are we usually comparing

789
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
when it works better

790
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm just comparing the light environment

791
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It will be broken for a few days a year

792
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That good weather platform may be 365 days a year

793
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
It's only about 5% broken

794
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
5% of the days

795
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So about 10 days or so

796
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
10 days like this

797
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
that relative to your instrument

798
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
The instrument must be very stable except for the external environment

799
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The instrument must be very stable

800
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
This way you can satisfy these

801
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Astronomer Observational Needs

802
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
That's another

803
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
this temperature environment

804
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
usually just good weather

805
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
no cloud place

806
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So it's a relatively dry environment

807
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
what about the earth

808
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
This relatively dry environment

809
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Usually means that the temperature is very low

810
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
low humidity

811
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So what about our instrument

812
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You have to work in a very low environment

813
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So put

814
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,800
If you put ordinary things in a low-temperature and low-humidity environment,

815
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,000
sometimes it doesn't work properly

816
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,200
The most commonly cited example is the

817
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,000
Usually the sky culture is already a high mountain

818
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So a high mountain means that its air pressure is also very low.

819
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
The air is relatively thin

820
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So in the early days, if you took the hard drive to the mountain

821
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
That hard drive often fails

822
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Because the hard disk is actually very fast to read

823
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
it spins a fast motor

824
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
It is because of its fast rotation speed

825
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Then float up to do this reading action

826
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
These drives usually have a high failure rate in the mountains

827
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Motors because the air is too thin

828
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
There is no way for others to float it alone

829
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
So there are some very special things in this special environment

830
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
some very special factors

831
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
When you're developing hot weather

832
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
must be taken into account

833
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
ok then i'm back with this photo

834
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Then this photo actually tells you that it is inside an instrument

835
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
probably something

836
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the first one is

837
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
We can see that there are of course a lot of screws in here

838
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We ignore the screw

839
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Did you see it has its lens, has its body

840
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And then there's this main electronic part of it

841
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
And the most important core, the detector inside it

842
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Probably just these few

843
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Form the core of astronomical instruments

844
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
you have an optical system

845
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You can go get this signal and put it together

846
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
after that you have a detector

847
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That detector can

848
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
The data that converts your signal from light to electricity

849
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
there's some circuitry that handles this electron

850
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
digitize its signal

851
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Then of course you have some mechanical structure

852
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
make it reachable

853
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
stable automatic development

854
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,500
support your lens

855
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,000
And this detector of yours

856
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,500
then i just said

857
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
The first is to speak to the news

858
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,500
The most important thing is this astronomical optics system

859
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
that optical system

860
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I just saw it mostly from the camera's point of view

861
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
so you may be

862
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
that is an imaging system

863
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That's actually sometimes more than that

864
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
because if I want to know its spectrum

865
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
that's in this optical system

866
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
it will have split light

867
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Then sometimes there will be this exciter

868
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
this other optical system

869
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Then I can know the light that comes in

870
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What is the direction of its intensification?

871
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
The optical system can be said to be in the astronomy department

872
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
very important part

873
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
because it actually determines the quality of the image

874
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
field of view size and you can achieve this

875
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
resolution

876
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,320
The resolution is actually some

877
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,140
theoretical limit

878
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,140
I originally brought another small thing to demo today for everyone to see

879
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,500
But then it turned out that our laser

880
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
not enough

881
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,600
Not powerful enough for everyone to see

882
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,800
but this

883
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,840
What is the limit of the so-called optical system?

884
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,500
Basically everyone if

885
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,100
When I was in middle school and high school, I did the limit of diffraction

886
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,360
In fact, this is the limit of the diffraction

887
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,460
Diffraction limit means

888
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,360
if i had a laser light

889
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,960
Then there's a small hole here

890
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,560
What about after the laser light passes through the small hole?

891
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,860
It will have this circular, this diffracted, this

892
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
pattern generated

893
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,660
that hole

894
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
smaller

895
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,060
The point of this diffraction is larger

896
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,060
what does that mean

897
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,960
My words, if you take this sock as a

898
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
your hole

899
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,060
Then this point represents the one I can image

900
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,160
point size

901
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,540
In this way, it can be estimated that

902
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,040
Where is the limit of this resolution?

903
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,840
So when my sea-goggle gets bigger

904
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,800
My image quality

905
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,640
That is, the limit of its theory will be smaller

906
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,040
that wavelength

907
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,840
It also depends on the wavelength

908
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,500
If the wavelength is shorter

909
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,740
I can also get higher resolution

910
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,300
Here I give an example

911
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,840
everyone has this phone

912
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,680
In fact, every mobile phone has its lens inside.

913
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,840
what about the lens

914
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,980
In fact, it will tell you

915
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,040
Your lens has a so called this F Ratio

916
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,580
So it is F1.8, F2.0

917
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,540
or a digital camera that tells you

918
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,900
How much is this F?

919
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,880
In fact, this is the D

920
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,840
in my company

921
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,180
Large D divides this value of small D

922
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,180
So you put this value in

923
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,080
then multiply by your wavelength

924
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
you can get your limit

925
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,920
So if an iPhone 11 latest

926
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,700
What about the iPhone 11 Pro?

927
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,000
its resolution

928
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,200
The theoretical resolution limit is

929
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,700
about a microphone or so

930
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,200
That's the best that can be achieved theoretically.

931
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,400
this resolution

932
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,100
Actually because you have some

933
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,000
optical quality above

934
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,800
by

935
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,200
when assembling

936
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
Supply differential impact

937
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,500
so this

938
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,600
Usually only a theoretical limit

939
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,400
Your real imaging will be much better than this

940
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,800
Worse

941
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,000
I just said

942
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,600
our this

943
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,000
atmosphere creates labor

944
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,200
Then this atmosphere produces labor

945
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,400
In fact, it has a great impact on our astronomy.

946
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Basically if you are

947
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,300
when the weather is bad

948
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,000
You can see that this star point keeps shaking

949
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,600
so although

950
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,200
When we built this big binoculars

951
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,800
I theorize it can get very high on this

952
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,700
resolution

953
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,100
But the atmosphere is here

954
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,600
when moving around

955
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,000
Actually my resolution

956
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
will be greatly

957
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We just said that Unlimited Power will not be affected by this.

958
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So they came up with a very powerful trick when doing infinite electricity observation.

959
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
is to use special technology to simulate this super large chip

960
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
What about this huge chip?

961
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The so-called ultra-long limit interference shadow

962
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That is why we can see black holes this time

963
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
In fact, it uses this antenna scattered all over the earth

964
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Aggregate this signal of his to simulate a very large chip

965
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Then I just talked about the limit of this resolution

966
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It has something to do with the caliber of my chip.

967
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Therefore, if the aperture of my wafer is small

968
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
My resolution is poor

969
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Then I am on the ground, I can best simulate the largest situation

970
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It's me who put this antenna in different corners of the world

971
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Then it will have an antenna the size of an earth

972
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Then we can see our black hole

973
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,240
You see this and the above tells you

974
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,140
When the two antennas are very close, the resolution is not good

975
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,740
when i pull it away

976
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,740
its resolution will increase

977
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,940
What about the actual operation inside?

978
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,940
It is more complicated than the concept just now

979
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,340
because I'm actually simulating the entire Earth

980
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,540
When it comes to size, I have several points

981
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,440
That is, my antenna may have seven or eight points

982
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,940
in various places around the globe

983
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,180
Then I have to rely on the earth's rotation

984
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,180
To make up for the distance between this point and the point

985
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,680
so that my image will become clearer and clearer

986
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,180
Then this is what we were before

987
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,180
When doing this black hole observation

988
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,680
can get this

989
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,180
Why can you get such a fresh image

990
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,180
very important reason

991
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,680
What about visible light?

992
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,180
is when you have a lot of this old hole

993
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,180
Actually you didn't

994
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I can't achieve the effect of the interference I mentioned in the image just now

995
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Because the effect of this interference is actually when the signal comes from outer space

996
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
it has not been disturbed by any

997
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
So what about this light in a different position?

998
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
You can combine it to achieve the effect of imaging

999
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
What if you have a large disturbance

1000
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
My scent information has changed

1001
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
At this time, I have no way to achieve the effect of this interference.

1002
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So in general at the wavelength of visible light

1003
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We have this phase difference caused by this atmospheric vibration

1004
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I have no way to do this intervention

1005
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So the interference of the ultra-long line just mentioned

1006
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It's all only possible over the radio.

1007
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
in visible light or infrared

1008
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
We're going to use some special methods

1009
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
This has a special term called modulation optics

1010
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
What is the meaning of modulation optics

1011
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I want to take this atmospheric old hole out of it

1012
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Atmospheric old holes usually when light passes through the atmosphere at different altitudes

1013
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Originally its light should be the red and green lines represent the wavefront of light

1014
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That is, when the light signal comes in, you pull up the highest point of its vibration position

1015
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Logically it should be flat

1016
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
There is this kind of light coming in flat, parallel light coming in

1017
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
When the wavefront is this parallel I can get a perfect image

1018
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But after passing through the atmosphere, it usually becomes the appearance of the external airflow

1019
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Then if I want to correct the appearance of the external airflow, I have to use a distorted mirror

1020
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I just let this distorted mirror twist along with this my wavefront

1021
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Then twist with the wave front

1022
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It passes through this mirror reflection, and its peeling will be flat

1023
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
After that mediocre, I'll get

1024
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Same as my interference limit

1025
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
such a sharp impact

1026
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
that's a video

1027
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
This is King Kate glasses

1028
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
They do this modulation optics

1029
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The image turned out to be blurry

1030
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
After I turned on the modulation optics correction

1031
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
The image suddenly becomes very sharp

1032
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That's the difference when you take the atmospheric old hole

1033
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
after fixing it

1034
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You can get very beautiful images

1035
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
that beautiful image

1036
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
it has some full size restrictions

1037
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Because of this atmospheric old hole

1038
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
different in different positions

1039
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
we have a noun called

1040
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
It's your Cohirin's Lens

1041
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That is to say, how big is the atmosphere?

1042
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
its old hole is the same length

1043
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,900
In Taipei City, this range may only be about 20 centimeters

1044
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,300
The environment on the mountain is better

1045
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,500
maybe a few meters

1046
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,100
so you take this

1047
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,500
When the difference caused by the atmospheric flood is completely corrected

1048
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,300
In fact it is only in this

1049
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,700
you can see you can refer to

1050
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,300
can measure this

1051
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,700
The vicinity of this point where the old cave looks like

1052
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,200
will have a good impact

1053
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,600
so you see this

1054
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,600
This frame is actually very, very small

1055
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,500
It is only 0.8 x 0.8

1056
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,100
arc seconds

1057
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,700
One arc second is 3600th of a degree

1058
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,400
so you know it this is actually watching

1059
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,100
very very small range

1060
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,700
to see this

1061
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,100
So usually this

1062
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,600
The problem with modulated optics is that the field of view becomes very, very small

1063
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,000
So if it wants

1064
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,700
increase it this

1065
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,900
What about the field of vision?

1066
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,900
you just

1067
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
do some other tricks

1068
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Other tricks include just hitting this laser

1069
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I can shoot lasers in all directions from the wrist glasses

1070
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
The laser itself is like a reference for me

1071
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
After the laser hits it, I will look at the point where the laser shines

1072
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You can know when you go up and down from this laser

1073
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
After this atmospheric god it's old hole look

1074
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
i can hit several

1075
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I'll know after a few hits

1076
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
In this area of ​​the mirror that completes me

1077
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
All Atmospheric Old Hole areas above

1078
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
This correction actually requires a very fast calculation

1079
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
because basically you need to achieve

1080
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
More than 500 corrections per second

1081
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So you need to have a lot of sensors

1082
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
and many lasers

1083
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and then go and do it together

1084
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
This is currently on the Department of Astronomy

1085
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
It is also a very important field of research

1086
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Just to correct the disturbance caused by the atmosphere

1087
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,700
That's another reason

1088
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,500
That's why we have NASA that wants to launch this

1089
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Havoc grid average or even the next generation

1090
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,000
We say that JWST's access to the network

1091
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That is, the labor of the atmosphere actually limits a lot of this

1092
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,500
We can reach this limit with ground-based observations

1093
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,000
so if you

1094
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,000
I just said that the average size of our largest net on the ground is 10 meters

1095
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
The Havoc net is actually very small, it is only 2 meters

1096
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Then why can 2 meters see farther than 10 meters?

1097
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
This resolution is an atmospheric effect is a big reason

1098
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,000
Apart from what I just said, that lens is the one

1099
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
What about resolution

1100
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Of course, its design also has a lot to do with the size of my field of vision.

1101
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
If my focal length is short

1102
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Its field of view is larger

1103
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,860
If you have played with the camera

1104
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,400
should know

1105
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,500
if the shot is short

1106
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,800
usually i can see wide

1107
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,100
Then if I have a long lens

1108
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,900
I just zoom in well

1109
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,900
i can see far

1110
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,400
Then of course we're doing astronomical observations.

1111
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,000
We hope that the bigger the field of vision, the better.

1112
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,900
If the field of vision is larger

1113
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,400
I will collect this information in a wider range at one time

1114
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,400
but

1115
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,200
When the field of view is bigger

1116
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,100
The larger the range of angles it enters the light

1117
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,800
so you may have very off-center light coming in

1118
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,200
at this time

1119
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,000
when you are doing optical design

1120
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,300
it will be very very difficult

1121
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,800
the other is you

1122
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,400
The last imaged surface

1123
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,900
is not a flat

1124
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,200
so this is a

1125
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,400
the real photo is

1126
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,400
I discovered a lot of this western alien a while ago

1127
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,800
Because there's this satellite called the Keppel satellite

1128
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,000
that actually

1129
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,900
This is it

1130
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,240
It intersects the plane is a curved

1131
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,000
Because you want to make an imaging system with a large field of view

1132
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It is difficult for you to adjust the curvature of the field of view itself back

1133
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,500
so you end up with

1134
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,300
You have to do your imaging on a curved plane

1135
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,700
This technology will be much more difficult

1136
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:33,200
This is an example of a visible light camera that we have previously cooperated with Japan

1137
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,200
Usually in this lens inside the lens of the whole system camera

1138
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,200
There are usually many lenses

1139
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,200
Each lens has its own function

1140
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,200
It is to correct its chromatic aberration

1141
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:55,700
Possibly a fix so that the view doesn't turn into a curved view

1142
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:00,200
That could be the whole image of this

1143
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,240
twist it to make it small

1144
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,540
so in one shot

1145
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,840
Usually very, very many lenses are used

1146
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,640
So this increase in instrument size

1147
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,440
These lenses are also getting larger in size

1148
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,600
You should be able to see it like this

1149
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,840
its 400

1150
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,440
Its radius is 41 cm

1151
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,040
So the whole lens is about 82 cm

1152
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,640
That's probably pretty close

1153
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,240
The limit of what we can do so far

1154
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,840
In addition, if this thing is to be used in infrared

1155
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,440
Its consideration is different

1156
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,100
Because this in infrared

1157
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:43,300
camera we often need is

1158
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,440
cooler observed temperature

1159
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,840
I'm going to take all these lenses down to cryogenics

1160
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,900
How cold is this, probably

1161
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,000
around minus 200 degrees

1162
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,640
at minus 200 degrees

1163
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,240
you are making this lens

1164
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,440
When it comes to the design of this mirror frame

1165
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,280
you have to use some special

1166
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Otherwise, we usually say that heat expands and contracts with cold

1167
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
My lenses shrink slowly

1168
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Metals expand when heated and contract when cooled.

1169
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So how do you go about cooling down

1170
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
You make this lens able to sustain it

1171
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
originally designed location

1172
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That requires some special design

1173
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Let it be a very uniform when shrinking

1174
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
There is always something holding it

1175
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
keep it in this fixed position

1176
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
that in addition

1177
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Design on Infrared

1178
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
its lenses are not big

1179
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
The composition is also different

1180
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It is usually divided into two blocks

1181
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
One is to let the light coming back from the outer mirror

1182
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
First the paint tool becomes a collimated light at a time

1183
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
that on collimated light

1184
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
We usually have some filters

1185
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
or block the outside mirror

1186
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
The unwanted infrared rays that come in

1187
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Only after that did the second imaging

1188
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
so it's in the infrared

1189
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
its lens

1190
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,000
The number of lenses inside is usually quite a lot.

1191
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
except for this camera

1192
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I just said that sometimes what we need is to make it a spectroscopic

1193
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,000
This is our participation in another goby project

1194
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
A pattern for the design of an optical system

1195
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Usually in this light goby

1196
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
it is very complicated to run

1197
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,000
In this example it actually has a Xiafeng

1198
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
The light from Xiafeng

1199
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It will hit my zero mirror first

1200
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and then hit my light

1201
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And then bounce back after the light

1202
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
same same mirror

1203
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Let it hit back to the lens of this camera of mine

1204
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Let this light that has been split

1205
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
can be imaged on my detector

1206
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So its optical path is usually three-dimensional and very complicated

1207
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
this tossed and tossed

1208
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
In the end you'll end up with a spectrum like this

1209
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
This is a high-resolution spectrum

1210
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
You can see this presumably from a microphone

1211
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Up to 2.5 mics the light is all spread out

1212
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Here you will see that I am all this is the one used by our school

1213
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
spectral lines so you'll see it's bright all the way through

1214
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Spectra also come in many different forms

1215
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
This is when I only look at one celestial body

1216
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Then spread the light as far as possible

1217
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
This is a high-resolution spectrometer

1218
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
There's another one where I want to see a lot of different celestial objects at once

1219
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Then make all the celestial bodies line up

1220
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Is this fiber optic or

1221
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
the shorter one

1222
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Safeng's spectrometer

1223
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Then you see this light of every celestial body

1224
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It separates it in a small range

1225
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
So the resolution of this optical auxiliary is relatively poor.

1226
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But I see many celestial signals at once

1227
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So this topic of different astronomical studies

1228
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You need to need different instruments

1229
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Let you achieve different goals like this

1230
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I just talked about the optical system

1231
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Another very important thing is of course the detector

1232
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
After I take the light, whether it is imaging or splitting it,

1233
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
The most important thing is that you have something to convert the signal

1234
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,000
The detector will of course determine the sensitivity of the instrument

1235
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
if my detector is good

1236
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Then I can detect very weak signals

1237
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Wait for my temperature to be lower

1238
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
thank you all

1239
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:10,500
What about the light? The detector we usually use

1240
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,500
It is the well-known semiconductor

1241
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,500
Well, there are actually many kinds of semiconductors.

1242
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,500
Well, what we use most often are thin semiconductors.

1243
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,500
Then this thin semiconductor is because there are many on the earth

1244
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:32,500
Then it fits perfectly and fits within our light-detectable range.

1245
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,000
exactly the same

1246
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So what about this fine-made detector?

1247
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,500
That's all the use of this camera

1248
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,500
or in astronomical instruments

1249
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,500
But if you want to detect this wavelength

1250
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,500
If it is longer than the thin detection wavelength

1251
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Then you can't use this Silicon

1252
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Then this time you have to use other different materials

1253
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Materials have their limits

1254
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
you need to use a different material

1255
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
as detectors for different astronomical instruments

1256
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
that's in the detector

1257
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
There is a very important factor is

1258
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
the size of my pixel

1259
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Because the size of the pixel actually determines your

1260
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Final instrument resolution

1261
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
no matter i put my light on

1262
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
How small can it be concentrated

1263
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
If I am one pixel this big

1264
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Then my light is only a little

1265
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I still have the whole pixel lit up

1266
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
So usually when we design

1267
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
We'll be looking at the pixel size of this detector

1268
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Make a match between my resolution

1269
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We usually choose between two and three pixels

1270
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
to cover a point of light

1271
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Theoretically, it is possible to obtain the most effective

1272
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
most efficient to

1273
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
We say sample your spot of light

1274
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
a resolution of

1275
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,600
So you can achieve the best resolution with the fewest pixels

1276
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,340
the opposite

1277
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,800
That is, if you do it this way

1278
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,600
You can achieve the largest field of view with the least number of pixels

1279
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,000
without sacrificing your resolution

1280
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,600
So something like this

1281
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,200
this pattern below

1282
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,000
What is shown in the image is a

1283
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
For the light of the stars, you have 30 pixels

1284
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
to cover it like this

1285
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,500
That's what I just said

1286
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,500
Well

1287
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,800
Because we use these for astronomy

1288
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,900
Binoculars are very large

1289
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,500
so its this

1290
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,000
long focal length

1291
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,700
When the focal length is very long, the field of view

1292
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:43,500
This range covered

1293
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,800
Well

1294
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,700
with normal mobile phone

1295
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,500
The range that each pixel can cover

1296
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,300
There will be a huge difference

1297
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,200
So the pixels we choose will be different

1298
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,700
So the pixels of the astronomical visible light camera are about

1299
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,400
about 10 microns

1300
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,400
that ordinary mobile phone

1301
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,400
A cell phone is about a micron

1302
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,280
then you might want to say

1303
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
a micron

1304
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,280
i just said

1305
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,780
If a good Apple phone

1306
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,780
Its lens resolution is approximately

1307
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,780
The light spot is about a few microns

1308
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,280
So in fact, the P matching of these two

1309
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,780
is already very close to what I just said

1310
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,880
because you have to think about saying this

1311
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,180
the lens itself

1312
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:24,280
It actually still has some errors

1313
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,280
so it may image quality

1314
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,580
It's about two to three microns

1315
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,780
If you use a micron-sized pixel

1316
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,780
will reach our

1317
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,780
Use two to three pixels to cover the point of light

1318
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,780
the size of this decision

1319
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,780
then this is us

1320
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,780
Same as the one that was paired with the lens just now

1321
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:51,780
this detector

1322
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,780
then it this is a

1323
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,780
900 million pixel astronomical camera

1324
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,780
Then this 900 million pixels put it together

1325
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,780
because a pixel is big

1326
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,800
So it's about the size of your arm

1327
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,500
That's like our normal camera

1328
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,200
Commercial cameras are very different

1329
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,500
Commercial cameras we want to say

1330
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,100
The smaller the better with this thing

1331
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,100
The smaller the phone camera, the better.

1332
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:19,400
that astronomy is the opposite

1333
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,100
Tianwen hopes that the bigger the better, the better.

1334
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,100
the bigger words

1335
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,600
The better you can have this resolution

1336
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,600
The camera used for astronomy is usually

1337
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,600
The photosensitive element used in it is also different.

1338
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,600
This astronomy usually we say it uses the structure of CCD

1339
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:46,600
It is CCD and its noise is relatively small

1340
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:51,600
Then if you want to use our general commercial CMOS Sensor

1341
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,600
that looks about the same

1342
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,600
You can't tell it's any different from the outside

1343
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,600
Anyway, it's all black.

1344
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,600
that black thing

1345
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,120
The structure inside is not the same will cause it

1346
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:07,920
has some disadvantages and some advantages

1347
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,500
Generally speaking, CDs for astronomy

1348
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,460
Its detection rate and sensitivity are very high

1349
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,340
There is very little noise, but it reads very slowly

1350
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:21,000
So when I'm taking pictures, I'm just very, very slow

1351
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,880
No way, just like this camera can

1352
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,420
It's almost like making a video, it keeps coming

1353
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,960
keep reading

1354
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,260
The one used for general astronomy

1355
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:36,580
As for this Sensor, you can read a page in about a second.

1356
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,640
So you'll see this image is

1357
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,720
That's astronomical because often we all have to

1358
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:45,040
It's a long exposure, so it doesn't really matter

1359
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,140
So for the most part, astronomy is

1360
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,700
I love using this CD

1361
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,280
Because of its, relatively speaking, its Performance is better

1362
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,060
That

1363
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,860
What about this CMOS camera?

1364
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,100
its advantage is

1365
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
The speed is fast, it can do very fast orientation, and can also do some special reading

1366
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:14,000
In some projects, like the one we did with a trans-Neptunian eye

1367
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
We just use a CMOS camera to do it, hoping to be able to capture the brightness of the star twenty or twenty times per second

1368
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
So this is to really choose one of the above differences

1369
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
What about when you do a good job, when an astronomy department does a good job

1370
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,000
As far as the whole can play a very high resolution, this is the big one I just showed

1371
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
This camera with a large CD gain captures images

1372
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
That is, it can be inserted into the face all the time, and you can magnify it hundreds of times.

1373
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Not hundreds of times, you can zoom in tens of thousands of times to see very clear celestial images

1374
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
In that video, I just said that there are 900 million pixels

1375
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That 900 million pixels covers a lot

1376
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,500
We can have more astronomical data

1377
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,500
Let you do this related research

1378
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,000
that visible light

1379
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,000
Because this Silicon is relatively cheap

1380
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,500
So we can do relatively cheap

1381
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,000
we can spell many

1382
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
like we just said

1383
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,500
There are more than 100 pieces of this sensor on the entire glue plane

1384
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,000
what about infrared

1385
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,500
It is basically because of the material

1386
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:33,500
So relatively speaking, the cost is much more expensive

1387
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,500
This is a project we participated in before

1388
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,000
we used four slices

1389
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,500
One is 4 million pixels

1390
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:43,500
A total of 16 million pixels of this infrared finishing

1391
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
That 16 million pixels seems to say

1392
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,500
Hey, my phone is better than his

1393
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,000
Eh, yes, there is nothing wrong with that

1394
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
but this one this one

1395
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,500
four

1396
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,500
four add up to

1397
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Well

1398
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,960
I remember correctly, it was 60 million Taiwan dollars

1399
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,840
These are the four

1400
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,640
It will be so small when put together

1401
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,840
Then why this is because it

1402
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,100
its making is complicated

1403
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,540
it usually takes a

1404
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:13,840
there is one

1405
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,440
The detailed circuit for this readout is below

1406
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,100
Then each pixel

1407
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,140
Each pixel, it has a little this

1408
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:22,000
We call Yindian

1409
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,440
Yin this

1410
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:24,740
bump

1411
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,500
Then this Yin bump is in contact with each of these detectors

1412
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,660
There is another article about this chip of the detector

1413
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,340
each pixel above

1414
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,000
to connect it

1415
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,540
Then you can put this

1416
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,040
The signal from the detector

1417
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,840
Read it out through the circuit of this Srika

1418
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:44,940
that's because of this thing

1419
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,440
Usually need to work under very low temperature

1420
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,440
like we did see before

1421
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,840
The way this thing works is two hundred degrees below zero

1422
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,740
So there is a lot of this hot account very wrong

1423
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,700
You don't want it to break in the middle

1424
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:06,000
So the technology here is quite, quite complicated.

1425
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,200
So that's why it's so expensive

1426
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
it's expensive though

1427
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,500
But in fact, it will show this video after a while

1428
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,700
you won't believe this

1429
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,000
one is so expensive

1430
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,000
Then what I made seems to be not so good

1431
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,900
Apart from this you have to have a mechanical system

1432
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,600
Just some shutters

1433
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,500
Then the cryogenic system

1434
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:33,700
then vacuum

1435
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,700
Because when you want to lower your Sensor to low temperature

1436
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,600
If you didn't vacuum

1437
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,700
Then the whole system is completely deiced.

1438
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,200
so you need to vacuum

1439
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,400
then low temperature

1440
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,700
then there are some motors inside

1441
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,600
If I want to exchange this filter of mine

1442
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,100
then i need a motor

1443
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,700
and then some are mechanical arms

1444
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,100
Then the shutter looks like this

1445
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,900
The appearance of these things is actually very important

1446
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,700
Because these things have the speed at which they work

1447
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,200
will affect the speed of your observations

1448
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,600
that its accuracy

1449
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,400
will also affect the one you observe

1450
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,200
overall accuracy

1451
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,000
then this is

1452
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,100
One of the first infrared cameras we worked on

1453
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,900
it looks like this

1454
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,800
there

1455
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,500
That's the big vacuum gun and the cryogenic system

1456
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,300
over here is my cooler

1457
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,600
That cooler is connected to this one

1458
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,400
just open the middle

1459
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,000
After opening this

1460
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,200
Then there is green

1461
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,400
its filter

1462
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,000
that big filter ring

1463
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,200
can be rotated here

1464
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:34,900
to rotate

1465
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,900
just go to when you need a different color

1466
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:38,100
just turn

1467
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:40,200
turn that filter ring

1468
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,400
I just forgot to mention that

1469
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,100
astronomical this

1470
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,500
image has a

1471
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,900
normal camera

1472
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:47,600
big difference

1473
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,300
It's me, in fact, every time I shoot it, it's black and white

1474
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,100
That is, when everyone takes pictures, they will be colored as soon as they are taken.

1475
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,700
Then why are you shooting in color?

1476
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:57,400
Because we shot in black and white

1477
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,900
That's because in your

1478
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
There is this green light film in front of the Sensor of the camera

1479
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Color green film is usually four pixels inside

1480
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
two are green and one is blue and one is red

1481
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Four pixels produce a

1482
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
this image in color

1483
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
We don't usually do that in astronomy we just take a photo

1484
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
We put different color filters in front of this real series

1485
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
So I take an image of it could be a green image and then a blue image

1486
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Then there is the red image, then I will combine these three images together

1487
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
It becomes a colored image like this

1488
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Then why do you do this like this?

1489
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
If I use the general practice of this Sensor

1490
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I have two greens and one red and one blue and when I put it together I actually have some information

1491
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It was private at the meeting because I was equal to two blues with one in the middle

1492
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
There is also a blank space between the two reds

1493
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:06,400
Such a resolution will be problematic for real scientific research

1494
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,780
So astronomy is usually achieved by exchanging filters

1495
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:16,380
The filter exchange system just talked about the rotating disk

1496
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:22,020
This is another form we made, like a robot

1497
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,560
What about this robot?

1498
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,880
He works differently

1499
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,740
This is a place where we put this whole thing

1500
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:35,080
Fast forward eight times

1501
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,140
Let's see how he does it. Basically we put

1502
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,440
our filters

1503
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,240
put this

1504
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,040
I made the inside of the filter holder

1505
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,560
there are three in there

1506
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:47,880
There are three on each side and there's one in here

1507
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,400
Mechanical arm

1508
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:51,200
The robotic arm can

1509
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,500
put in my

1510
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,560
in front of the detector

1511
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,860
filter take it away

1512
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,920
after taking it away

1513
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,800
There will be a raw sauce station and another raw sauce station

1514
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,100
Then this raw sauce station can be used to choose different filters

1515
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,200
That mechanical arm in the back

1516
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,000
Push my filter in again

1517
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,500
Okay, let's do this filter swap

1518
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,500
that thing

1519
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,100
In fact, it is no different from ordinary mechanical arms.

1520
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,500
but it's very demanding

1521
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,000
the first is

1522
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,200
Every time I put the filter back on

1523
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,100
The repeatability of the position should be very good

1524
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,200
So our

1525
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,200
every time you put it back

1526
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:32,400
Its error is 10 microns

1527
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,300
10 microns is

1528
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:36,700
Of course 1/1 of your hair

1529
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:37,900
So I can be positioned very accurately

1530
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,400
Because the positioning is accurate

1531
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,700
so my image

1532
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,900
When I want to stack images of three colors together

1533
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,500
so that there will be no error

1534
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:48,800
So it involves a lot of mechanical design

1535
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,900
how do you get this robot to work

1536
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,300
can be very stable

1537
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,900
and then you can put those filters in the same place each time

1538
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,900
That's another

1539
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,000
I want this thing to be very stable

1540
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
So I remember our requirement at that time was

1541
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,200
i want this thing

1542
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,600
RUN a thousand times will not break

1543
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,440
So when we started, we actually

1544
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:13,040
It took a lot of effort to make this system stable

1545
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,880
raise it all the way up to be able to

1546
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,240
It's been running all the time without any problems

1547
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,800
Besides these three things, of course

1548
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,900
The most important thing is the so-called electronic system

1549
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,100
To make it generate this

1550
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,700
real need signal

1551
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,400
It's these real devices it needs some signal

1552
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,800
to make it work

1553
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,600
Then you also need these signals

1554
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,300
These materials from the real department

1555
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,600
digitize it

1556
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,600
Then generate the image you want

1557
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,600
What about after the image is produced?

1558
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,100
That still needs a lot of this software system

1559
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,200
to make this system

1560
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,000
and data processing

1561
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,100
Then I just said that we have

1562
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:58,000
make a big this

1563
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,100
Before this stitching

1564
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,280
In fact, if you go to see the original filming of it

1565
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,680
Like actually it's really miserable

1566
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,200
You see this has a lot of things you don't want

1567
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,200
For example, white dots, black dots

1568
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:16,640
Then everything seems to be uneven

1569
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,400
Logically speaking, if it is a perfect image

1570
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,680
When you take a picture, this should be all the same brightness

1571
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:28,400
Because this is the one I use to correct my brightness

1572
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,760
an image of

1573
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,800
It's a pity that there is usually always a

1574
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,720
some without some

1575
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:40,440
For example, bad pixels or your failure

1576
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,240
The production process fails, for example

1577
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:45,040
in this place you will see

1578
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,840
there is one

1579
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,880
An Output of this Sensor is missing

1580
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,920
So it's all black

1581
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,240
That's visible light

1582
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,600
The safflower line is even worse

1583
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:59,960
I just talked about the $20,200,000

1584
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,860
The sound and color of these four direction lines

1585
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:03,800
after it's put together

1586
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,100
you shoot the sky

1587
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,660
This is what it shows you

1588
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,460
Do you have

1589
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,900
Eh, there is only one horizontal tone

1590
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,360
Then there are things like flowers

1591
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,900
Then we have to find some way to deal with it

1592
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,460
Of course I will be the first to know where this horizontal tune comes from.

1593
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,460
Hengtune is actually

1594
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,960
it's in this

1595
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,460
what we call big people

1596
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,960
when there is no exposure

1597
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,620
because you have a hot relationship with itself

1598
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:31,920
have a hot and active relationship

1599
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,120
So it already has a little signal

1600
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,960
then this should be deducted

1601
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,520
In addition, that means that each Sensor

1602
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:41,920
It has several different outputs

1603
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,820
Then the endpoint of this output

1604
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,820
The magnification of its magnification is not the same

1605
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,420
So this horizontal dialect

1606
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:50,620
Mainly because the magnification ratio is not the same

1607
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:51,820
what about the other

1608
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,120
It's on every Pixel

1609
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,360
Sometimes because of its Coding relationship

1610
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:58,120
Its detection efficiency is not the same

1611
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,120
So there will be some very strange patterns

1612
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
We can all find a way to get rid of this Penet

1613
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Then remove the bad points

1614
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Especially this side and here are all bad

1615
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
then remove it like this

1616
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Then you can get the corrected image

1617
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Then the corrected image is not the final one yet.

1618
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Because in the infrared this sky background

1619
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
it has been changing over time

1620
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
so you're going to get another no

1621
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
This background without celestial bodies

1622
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Finally you can actually get one of these

1623
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
finally finished

1624
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
then you will see this inside this

1625
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
We say we are very lucky

1626
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
will show up clearly

1627
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So this image processing in astronomy is

1628
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
very very important

1629
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Without image processing

1630
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
You'll never see such a beautiful image

1631
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Actually it is

1632
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
It turned out to be super scary

1633
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
no way

1634
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
you can't believe this

1635
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Of course, the black hole just mentioned is also

1636
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:07,000
I think if you guys have listened to our previous speeches or press conferences,

1637
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
We only need to do this ultra-long limit interference and data processing

1638
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
There are four teams in different parts of the world

1639
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Then it took a year to process

1640
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
That's all data processing

1641
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
actually very very important

1642
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
What you just said is usually on the ground.

1643
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
What problems will we encounter when developing on the ground

1644
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Finally, take a moment to talk about this space abandoned development

1645
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
That is different from the ground, in fact, it means

1646
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
My abandonment has to be able to withstand the launch process

1647
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,000
There is usually a lot of vibration during the launch.

1648
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
and then a lot of this noise

1649
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Of course it can still operate in the space environment

1650
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
that besides this

1651
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Say goodbye to me when you fly up

1652
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Then if I fly up and break

1653
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I really have no way

1654
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Like Harvard, it is possible to send space theory to repair it. The probability is

1655
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Only about two times

1656
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Now there is no space to say that you can fly to this space.

1657
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
So he has high requirements in his heart

1658
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So mostly he uses proven techniques

1659
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
That is, no one will use unverified

1660
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
so we say

1661
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
we usually joke

1662
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
In fact, all the satellites use technologies ten years ago.

1663
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Because you want the technology from ten years ago

1664
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
then mature

1665
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Then after a long time to do verification

1666
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Because space one has a lot of extra testing

1667
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
You're going to do a radiation test

1668
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
There is a lot of radiation in space

1669
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
This evidence test

1670
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
You have to be able to work in the space environment

1671
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
The space environment is very special, that is, your satellite is usually rotating

1672
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,460
Where the sun shines is hot

1673
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,460
it's cold when turned to the back

1674
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,460
so they need to do some

1675
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:10,960
Fractuation at a very special temperature

1676
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,960
What I just talked about is vibration and noise.

1677
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,460
The radiation dose in space

1678
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:22,000
Usually it is 100KR

1679
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,660
that's a

1680
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:26,660
Anyway, this is a unit of radiation dose.

1681
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,000
that's usually in astronomy

1682
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Sometimes you have very special situations

1683
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
That is, you are going to launch this satellite to a farther place

1684
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
For example, the harshest place is Jupiter

1685
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
So everything has to be tested first

1686
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
that's our detector

1687
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I don't know if you can see clearly

1688
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Are these two different?

1689
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
No

1690
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Sorry about the resolution problem

1691
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
In fact, it is our device to fight

1692
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
This radiation dose after doing this test on the ground

1693
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
it will have a lot of white spots

1694
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,560
But here, sorry to see it out

1695
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,840
Then Jupiter, if you go to Jupiter, play Jupiter is the earth

1696
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,240
all this

1697
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,440
The magnetic field inside the form is the largest

1698
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,040
The magnetic field is the largest, and its magnetic field lines

1699
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,600
will capture more of this generation of electric particles

1700
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,000
So the radiation it catches will be even greater

1701
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:22,960
so before

1702
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,240
Then it is the satellite of Safari, Geno

1703
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,520
it

1704
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:29,480
You see it's the dose

1705
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,040
250 times around the lower satellite

1706
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,200
So you're testing higher doses like this

1707
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,560
so it is

1708
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,680
a satellite it protects

1709
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,080
In order to protect the instrument inside it from letting the

1710
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:45,200
radiation killed it

1711
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,200
it retakes 100

1712
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,080
80 kg like this

1713
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,560
so it

1714
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,760
This satellite actually shrinks the outer layer of its instruments

1715
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,280
It is packed with a lot of this very thick this

1716
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,920
stereotype

1717
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,080
let it not be this

1718
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,560
The radiation in this space killed it

1719
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,880
But this is what I just said

1720
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,960
We usually in the satellite development process

1721
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,260
We need a lot of this semo cycle

1722
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,280
I put this thing

1723
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,340
The whole instrument cools it down

1724
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,660
depends on the orbit of your satellite

1725
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,020
Usually if it is in an orbit relatively close to the earth

1726
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:23,560
probably will be in

1727
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,900
Temperature between plus 50 degrees and minus 50 degrees

1728
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,940
just let it do the loop

1729
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,500
Of course because in space it is

1730
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:36,600
It's a complete vacuum so you vacuum up the whole instrument

1731
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,140
then heat it inside

1732
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,940
or cooling heating cooling

1733
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:40,960
then keep watching

1734
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,240
see if there is any problem with it

1735
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,340
Then there is the so-called vibration

1736
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:48,900
This is the instrument we made before

1737
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:50,420
failure example

1738
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,480
Actually it's this

1739
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:55,300
We put the instrument on a vibrating table

1740
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,820
Then it will simulate the vibration when launching

1741
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,680
After finishing, my board fell off

1742
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,880
because when we design

1743
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,980
it's in the process of processing

1744
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:10,180
It's just the design

1745
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,480
But when processing

1746
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,480
it will generate some

1747
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,980
I said that the hard power is on this board

1748
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,680
so it breaks when you shake too much

1749
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,480
So these vibrating

1750
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:22,780
all design matters

1751
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:26,680
Letting you equal to making your design better

1752
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:31,680
so that it can really stand up to your design

1753
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,680
launch all questions

1754
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:35,680
So there will be no problem when actually launching

1755
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,680
It can be launched smoothly

1756
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,680
in this way

1757
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,680
It's actually pretty cool to watch this launch.

1758
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,680
is how much it shocks you

1759
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,680
thank you all

1760
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,600
elliptical orbit satellite

1761
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:08,400
The place where the lowest ball is the lightest is about 300 kilometers

1762
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:14,600
The farthest place is about 10,000 kilometers

1763
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,400
It's all about what we're going to do

1764
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,800
then what's the point of these things

1765
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,800
what is his challenge

1766
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,400
we just said you do one thing

1767
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,400
I often want to say that angels, righteous people and

1768
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,000
If you ask me, is there any abandoned development now?

1769
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
In fact, I told you everything is not

1770
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,400
we are doing this

1771
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,600
Abandoned development is always true

1772
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:50,000
It's really a very, very difficult situation right now.

1773
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,200
The first is the astronomical

1774
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,400
I want to say that after the big problem

1775
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,900
it's all big

1776
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,600
It's all big and he's been developing it for a long time

1777
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,600
So now we often joke that

1778
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,600
you make a plan now

1779
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,440
When will you finish this project?

1780
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,440
He can finish it when I retire

1781
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,440
So you often have a problem

1782
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:10,840
It means you do this for a long time

1783
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,640
when planning for a long time

1784
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,640
How do you attract people to invest

1785
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,640
Actually this is a big problem

1786
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,240
Of course the bigger you do this thing

1787
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,040
The more money you have

1788
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,600
So cross-border cooperation is normal

1789
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,440
We are often several countries

1790
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,040
come and do this together

1791
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,400
This is another project we have in Mexico

1792
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,240
We're going to this observatory in Mexico

1793
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:43,800
The Science of Building Three Telescopes to Make This Eye Star

1794
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,360
then you will see this snow

1795
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,440
And then the snow melts and then the snow comes again

1796
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:52,800
So this plan actually cost

1797
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,940
close to our ten years

1798
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:57,580
and then it might be about time to start

1799
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,580
Our observation work

1800
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,840
Ten years in astronomy is pretty normal now

1801
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,900
A number is from starting a project to

1802
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,960
it can actually start observing

1803
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:12,800
It's not the end of the project but the start of doing what you want to do

1804
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,840
That's like ten years

1805
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:16,640
i just said

1806
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,700
Such multinational projects are also very common

1807
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,000
this is mine

1808
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,780
Another sentence that goes on now

1809
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,320
You can see how many points there are

1810
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,620
A point represents a cooperative unit

1811
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:27,640
so you have

1812
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:30,460
Five or six different countries at the same time

1813
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,000
come

1814
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,780
astronomers come together

1815
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:37,120
work on this development

1816
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,700
The biggest problem with this forecast is what to do when I have a meeting

1817
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:43,000
So usually you are not very early

1818
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,300
It's late for a meeting

1819
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,860
to do this conference call

1820
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,640
this is

1821
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,440
Then by the way why the earth is not flat

1822
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,280
why the earth is round

1823
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,560
That said

1824
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,700
Speaking of

1825
01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,320
I just talked about the angel Nadili

1826
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,460
Observatories are usually in that kind of shitty place

1827
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:08,260
I just talked about a series of design to consider these issues

1828
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,060
that work too

1829
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,700
This is us in Hawaii, Makia

1830
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:17,100
We have several observatories here

1831
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,300
I took this photo because our working environment is like this

1832
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,600
Temperature 1.8C

1833
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:25,960
Relative humidity 14%

1834
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,160
The most important thing is this is

1835
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:33,320
This is the air pressure is 620%

1836
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,960
Then we know that the normal ground should be 1000

1837
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,360
is about half

1838
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,460
So the oxygen in your airway over there is

1839
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:44,260
only half of the ground

1840
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,260
so usually a

1841
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:50,160
In Gaoshan town and very uncomfortable environment

1842
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,460
I would have liked to put a photo

1843
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:56,260
After my colleague got to the top, he quickly brought some oxygen up

1844
01:26:57,260 --> 01:26:58,460
where to visit

1845
01:26:58,960 --> 01:26:59,860
then there is

1846
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,720
So on this, if you have to do some very heavy work, it is actually very hard

1847
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,640
This is when I arrived very early

1848
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,920
At that time, I was photographed doing this

1849
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,560
We need to re-enforce this mirror

1850
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,600
Therefore, the aluminum of this degree on the entire surface of the mirror should be removed.

1851
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,760
wipe it clean

1852
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,440
it's very very tiring

1853
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,760
you have to take this

1854
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,560
This is the last step

1855
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,360
So take that gas mask off

1856
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,280
you have no oxygen

1857
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,080
Then you have to wear a gas mask while working

1858
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,760
it's very very hard

1859
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:42,400
Of course, our colleagues in Grinda are also protected from the cold

1860
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,560
rarely do you see this

1861
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,680
Why did he take this photo because he found this

1862
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,720
The temperature of color consciousness is almost the same as Huashi

1863
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:53,040
Then I knew it was Chinese style and it was about 30 degrees

1864
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,040
It's when it's minus 30 degrees

1865
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,960
When working outside, you have to be fully dressed and there will be no place to show

1866
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,000
That person is also the same, our salaries in the war rescue unit are very low

1867
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
What we need is, of course, what we need are very experienced engineers

1868
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
It is very difficult for an experienced engineer, and it is difficult for you to attract him with a salary

1869
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
So we usually use, I don't know, we say them, they're cute

1870
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
They just think it's more fun to work here.

1871
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Or if they are very interested in me, then they will be willing to join our team

1872
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Then of course we often meet people after they come

1873
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
After a year or two of what he learned, he left

1874
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
So this is a big problem

1875
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:46,000
He's not just them, even our researcher level is the same

1876
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Because I have worn one piece every ten years, and I have a piece of paper when I have worn one piece

1877
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Because of the normal conditions inside, just kick him out

1878
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
This director may be clearer

1879
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
It is the cooperation of the researchers of the Central Academy of Sciences

1880
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,800
There are actually some requirements for the number of papers

1881
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,600
So how are you putting yourself into this kind of work?

1882
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,200
It can also maintain the output of your paper

1883
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:15,500
In fact, it is also a very important question

1884
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:19,600
But I think I've told you so much today

1885
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,700
I think we've spent the past few years

1886
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:26,600
We really did a lot of planning

1887
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,200
Cover different this painting glasses

1888
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,200
Let these systems be installed on the painting glasses

1889
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
and then be able to play their role

1890
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:41,200
It is important to hope that they can make

1891
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,600
Astronomers in Taiwan can use these

1892
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,300
The instruments we made

1893
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:50,900
Then do the most cutting-edge astronomical research like this

1894
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,700
then we just started

1895
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,800
the beast talked about

1896
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,400
We are now at least two major projects that I am working on

1897
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,200
one is

1898
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Speaker's astronomy satellite

1899
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
This is an infrared astronomy satellite

1900
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
It is a big project of cooperation between Europe and Japan

1901
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:14,000
To send a 2.5-meter astronomical satellite into space

1902
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It operates at a lower temperature

1903
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Its entire system is 8K

1904
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
8K is minus -265 degrees

1905
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Almost the brightest mirror connection you can achieve

1906
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,000
We have already begun to design some instruments in this part

1907
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
This is tantamount to our first project to compare large and astronomical satellites

1908
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
So what we're doing now isn't...

1909
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Participation is not too big

1910
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,000
But it can provide us scientists to participate in perhaps this first-hand

1911
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Infrared Observation Data

1912
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
The other big project is

1913
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I just talked about the biggest future...

1914
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,340
But the golden king has already reached this EOT in Europe

1915
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:07,940
One and the instrument in which we are involved

1916
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:09,460
Then this series

1917
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:14,340
I just got back from Holland last week to talk to them

1918
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:16,640
what parts are we responsible for

1919
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:21,240
Taiwan has done very well because of the processing of some machinery

1920
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:23,820
So we might be responsible for the entire

1921
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:26,360
core part of a series

1922
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:27,400
How big is this series?

1923
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,700
The entire height of this series is approximately

1924
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,240
2.5 meters

1925
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,780
This width is

1926
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:35,080
About 1.5 meters

1927
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:36,620
It is easy to put this

1928
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:42,000
cover it all

1929
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,040
So this is our current

1930
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,320
Next

1931
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,900
key work items

1932
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:50,700
so today i

1933
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:54,020
It is very simple to introduce to you our Tianwen

1934
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:55,560
instruments of these

1935
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,580
and some

1936
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,120
details then

1937
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,640
some key points

1938
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
The conclusion is that we really need a lot of different talents

1939
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Of course, at the same time, our technology does not mean that we can do it ourselves.

1940
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
In fact, there are also cooperation with many domestic manufacturers

1941
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:18,000
We also undertake some cases of manufacturers to help them do some system development

1942
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,000
The hope is that in addition to building our own technology

1943
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:28,000
It can also help some domestic industries like this

1944
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Our astronomical institute was actually able to participate in these important international projects in the past

1945
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
In fact, it has a very important correlation with our technological crisis.

1946
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
That's the end of my speech today. Thank you.

1947
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Wang, for your wonderful speech.

1948
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
At that time, I heard that there are actually people stationed in Hawaii in our courtyard.

1949
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:58,000
At that time, my small mind was probably in YTB

1950
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,100
Wow, that's too much, I want to say that life is ashamed, couples play together

1951
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:07,300
Is it okay? Later I found out that they were in Monaca.

1952
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,600
Mona seems to be that Hawaii

1953
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,020
That Monaca seems to be

1954
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:14,100
In fact, Mona actually means three in Hawaii.

1955
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:17,600
So in the original there is still in Lulan

1956
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,100
I heard that wow it looks like a lot in Greenland

1957
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:22,100
great place still up

1958
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:25,400
The colleagues at the astronomical institute really worked hard

1959
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,400
Then everyone knows that in the Chinese Academy

1960
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:30,600
Let's just say that the research pressure is unbelievable again.

1961
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,100
So that one said it would take ten years to build an observatory

1962
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,600
Everyone knows that we are researchers

1963
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,700
About five or six years will be renewed

1964
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:41,100
Then if your academic research

1965
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,100
There is no way to publish a good paper

1966
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,900
soon you probably will

1967
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,900
So this research is incredibly stressful.

1968
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,000
no matter what

1969
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
thank you all

1970
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,900
What about us today, we have prepared some small gifts

1971
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:55,400
That is whether the presence is aimed at everyone

1972
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,600
Teacher Wang's wonderful speech

1973
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,100
do you have any questions

1974
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,700
Then if you report your name first

1975
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:04,700
Then there is your question, thank you

1976
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,800
After all Huang Qifang I am Datong

1977
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:12,800
I just learned that our

1978
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,800
Sensor for astronomical images

1979
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,200
The resolution is actually 10 times lower than that of a mobile phone

1980
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,500
10 micro meters and one micro meter

1981
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:23,500
Its pixel size is right

1982
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:27,300
Then such a large optical lens is 10 meters

1983
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,000
20 meters 30 meters

1984
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,400
so much information

1985
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:34,100
It seems a bit wasteful to use such a thick Sensor

1986
01:34:34,100 --> 01:34:36,200
Then I was wondering if there is a possibility

1987
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:38,400
I'm a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering

1988
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,300
Sensor of current commercial camera

1989
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:44,000
Tens of millions of pixels

1990
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Maybe its environmental quality

1991
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,100
Cannot meet the needs of astronomy

1992
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,900
Is it possible to use these small Sensors in the future?

1993
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,300
so high resolution

1994
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,300
Multiply it into an Array

1995
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:58,100
Because I just heard that there is a combination of Sensors

1996
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,100
just a few hundred million

1997
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,840
Then it may be tens of millions if you use this one like Sony.

1998
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:05,380
Tens of millions in a small street

1999
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:08,440
That pocket may be worth billions or tens of billions

2000
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,740
Is it possible

2001
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,780
I may not have said a word just now

2002
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:14,840
That's why we choose 10 microns

2003
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,380
When our pixel size

2004
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,400
actually because

2005
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,720
It's because of the big old hole I just mentioned

2006
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,080
That’s my optical theory. I can make this optical machine very small.

2007
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,620
Put the dot machine very small

2008
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,680
But because of this atmospheric old hole relationship

2009
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,980
So my dots get bigger

2010
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,320
Then I don't use a small sensor when the light spot becomes bigger

2011
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,600
that pitch

2012
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,120
to cover it because

2013
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:41,980
Each pixel will have a noise when read out

2014
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:42,760
so

2015
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,880
We will choose the size of this sensor which is about 10 microns

2016
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:51,200
Of course I just said that if you use that

2017
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:51,980
that

2018
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:54,780
modulated optics i can get this quality right

2019
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,840
At that time we usually

2020
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,120
use

2021
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,400
different way

2022
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,320
to lengthen the focal length of my optics

2023
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:05,300
let it Play Scale

2024
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:08,440
is the field of view per unit length

2025
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:09,560
let it change

2026
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:12,300
Of course in astronomy

2027
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,060
why do i seem to say

2028
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:16,500
Like I'm talking about 10 micro

2029
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:18,000
This pixel doesn't seem to change

2030
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,500
The main reason is that

2031
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,300
In developing these astronomy-specific

2032
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,600
There are very few companies with this sensor

2033
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:26,200
This is what we use on our phone

2034
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,500
This sensor is related to our own

2035
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:30,700
The sensor we use for astronomy

2036
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:32,800
The biggest difference is

2037
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,400
Sensitivity of the mobile phone

2038
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,500
The functionality of the sensor is only about 50%

2039
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,900
good about one percent

2040
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,100
Usually about 20 to 30 percent

2041
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,700
More than 90% of the astronomy was used that day

2042
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:47,000
Then this is related to it, the structure is not the same

2043
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,600
that is

2044
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,200
Slowly, the current sensor of the mobile phone

2045
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,000
also gradually changed to

2046
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,200
what we call preparation

2047
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,100
It's light coming in from the back

2048
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,500
Because there are many circuits on the Sensor

2049
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,100
These circuits will

2050
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,440
because it blocks the light

2051
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,800
So you can't increase its sensitivity

2052
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,860
Then when you go in from the back

2053
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,260
it can increase a lot

2054
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:10,400
But this back cover

2055
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,560
Sensor is

2056
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:16,160
At least CMOS is the Sensor of all our mobile phones

2057
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:19,700
It has only gradually become popular in the past two years

2058
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:20,660
I just mentioned

2059
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:24,260
We have a big camera with this CMOS

2060
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,060
That Sensor was actually at the beginning

2061
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:29,460
We all ask TSMC or UMC to ask them to do

2062
01:37:29,460 --> 01:37:30,220
say no

2063
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:31,820
because they asked

2064
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:32,620
large market

2065
01:37:32,620 --> 01:37:34,520
I said maybe 100 pills a year

2066
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,520
then he said goodbye

2067
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:39,260
So these requirements of astronomy

2068
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,300
How can I follow

2069
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,020
with average

2070
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:44,120
We still follow the general needs of the industry

2071
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,420
there is a big difference

2072
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:48,760
That's unless the two of them can get close

2073
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:52,160
We have the means to convince these companies

2074
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,520
they can invest

2075
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:54,860
in this way

2076
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:58,620
Otherwise, it would still be very expensive for us to do

2077
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,500
one

2078
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,500
My surname is Huang

2079
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,600
just be

2080
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,000
just like i see that

2081
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,000
It is when the live broadcast is when the black hole is live broadcast

2082
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:16,000
It seems that you will practice that kind of self-discipline

2083
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:19,300
The kind of manufacturers you mentioned just now, cooperation, etc.

2084
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,500
then i see

2085
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:23,700
I see Zhonggang, Zhonglong

2086
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,400
Then everyone kept writing

2087
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,500
Then it seems that in this so-called

2088
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:32,200
The cooperation between the instrument and the manufacturer

2089
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,700
it becomes as if the communication above

2090
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,300
Because this is a very professional kind of astronomy

2091
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,500
Then their kind as far as we know

2092
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:42,900
Probably some heavy industrial equipment

2093
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,400
Between these two, between you and the manufacturer

2094
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:47,900
Because it's still about astronomy

2095
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,500
the specialized part

2096
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,700
because what you want

2097
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,900
communication between them

2098
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,200
does it become

2099
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,500
Can I get a general idea?

2100
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,100
That's a good question

2101
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,120
Why we need our own engineers

2102
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:05,580
just because we need to do it

2103
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,580
or me too

2104
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:10,380
I want to understand the needs of astronomy

2105
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,880
that understands the norms of astronomy

2106
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,880
Then you can communicate with the manufacturer

2107
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,880
when i do this now

2108
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,380
I don't want to use the traditional way

2109
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,580
what do i want to change

2110
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,080
what do i need

2111
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,080
I didn't talk carefully just now

2112
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,580
In fact, many of our mechanical processing

2113
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:32,580
The accuracy we want is one or two

2114
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,580
That is, its machining accuracy is very, very high.

2115
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:39,580
One is one-tenth the width of a hair

2116
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:45,580
So when your team has these concepts

2117
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:49,580
And then it itself comes from industry acceptance

2118
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:52,580
It has a way to go back and communicate with people in this industry

2119
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:54,580
What do I want

2120
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,580
Then how can you possibly achieve

2121
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:58,580
what i want

2122
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Just like we developed the Sensor

2123
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Because I am the background of Sensor

2124
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I can communicate with the manufacturer about what I want

2125
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
what kind of circuit

2126
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,000
this one

2127
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Hello, Dr. Wang, my name is Lin

2128
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
i want to ask two questions

2129
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
The first is to say that in the development of so-called astronomical instruments

2130
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Not in the development of science graduate instruments

2131
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
What disciplines does it really need?

2132
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Then what is its cultivation and source usually like?

2133
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Then the second question is that in a complete astronomical observation program

2134
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
The role of the so-called scientist is, for example,

2135
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
astronomer or physicist throughout the program

2136
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
What parts of the work does it participate in and what role does it play

2137
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Thanks

2138
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
we need all kinds of people

2139
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So in our

2140
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
we have optical engineers

2141
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
we have mechanical engineers

2142
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
we have microwave engineers

2143
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Electronic function engineer Software function engineer

2144
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
And the function engineer of the detector

2145
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
So you can basically what I just mentioned

2146
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Each part has a corresponding functional division

2147
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
come and go take care of these things

2148
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Because we can't buy anything we touch

2149
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I even had to design the circuit myself

2150
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Then clean the factory to wash

2151
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Then come back and call yourself like this

2152
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
So basically these things are

2153
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
all needed

2154
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
The second question just said

2155
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
about the role of astronomers in observing

2156
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Basically after we finish the instrument

2157
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Astronomers will see that

2158
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
There is one more instrument on the earphone side that can be used

2159
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
They are going to explain the characteristics of this instrument

2160
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
We usually do some tests

2161
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
We put the instruments behind the observatory

2162
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
will start testing its basic features

2163
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
These properties will have a table

2164
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
or have a system that can do the calculations

2165
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
That day the astronomer based on what he thought

2166
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
he will calculate

2167
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,000
i want to see this celestial body

2168
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
How much observation time may I need

2169
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Then he will start writing his observation plan.

2170
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
the observation program

2171
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
If after the observation time

2172
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
The weather is great

2173
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
he gets his information

2174
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
After getting the information

2175
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
he's going to deal with it

2176
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
That deals with the usual words

2177
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Every instrument he might have

2178
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
meeting

2179
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
when we send the instrument out

2180
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
we will have

2181
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Follow his data processing system

2182
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,000
so he can use

2183
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
The data processing systems we provide

2184
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
to process his data

2185
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Then do more follow-up analysis

2186
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
or

2187
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
If he feels that he handles these data

2188
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
he is sure of himself

2189
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
He can also do his own data processing

2190
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Then do the following analysis

2191
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Then the subsequent analysis may be very

2192
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
there is a big difference

2193
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I may be doing statistics

2194
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I might just do this for a single celestial body

2195
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Analysis of characteristics

2196
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
that makes a big difference

2197
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
that is

2198
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
real astronomer

2199
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
or astrophysical systems they

2200
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
they are really professional

2201
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,000
ok this sir

2202
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Hello, I am a believer. Let me continue with the question you just answered.

2203
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I want to know, the world is currently full of information to say

2204
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
no one to analyze or say this

2205
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Every astronomer is waiting for that Q to say I want this data

2206
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
got it a year later

2207
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
This is where astronomers have two

2208
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
If you ask our director, he will say that there are too many materials

2209
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,000
If you go to check it casually, it will be the taper that can produce an infinite amount of taper every year.

2210
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
In fact, there is a lot of data

2211
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Data that has been observed at various observatories

2212
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
That of course means that there are many problems

2213
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Or there are many specialized subjects

2214
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
It needs new instruments to have a way to break through

2215
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:56,000
There is a way to go. For example, I want to see the universe farther away.

2216
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Then I couldn't get this far before, I couldn't

2217
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
So there are two very different kinds of this

2218
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
The path of research looks like this

2219
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
right

2220
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Are there any special requirements for the material of the lens?

2221
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Is the radius of that area ground by yourself?

2222
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Well

2223
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
In most of the development of astronomical instruments

2224
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,000
The research unit does not grind the lens itself

2225
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
few have

2226
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
In fact, we rely a lot on

2227
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
These relatively specialized optical manufacturers

2228
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
For example, there is a quite large factory in France

2229
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Then Japan like Kallang or Nikon

2230
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
they are also very useful

2231
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
those materials

2232
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Visible light materials are usually relatively fixed

2233
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
and easier to get

2234
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
The market for this is huge

2235
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
the infrared words

2236
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,540
so it's more difficult for me

2237
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,340
The problem I've found that I often run into is saying

2238
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:07,420
I now need a lens like 30cm

2239
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:09,740
But you ask the whole world to tell you

2240
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:12,300
no, no one produces

2241
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,340
Not the lens, just the material

2242
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,640
There is no such a large material

2243
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:20,480
So then you have to think of other ways to break through

2244
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,040
For example, if I divide a speed of light into

2245
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,840
34 light speeds like this

2246
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:29,440
to do different designs

2247
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,260
Let me ask Mr. Wang first

2248
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:37,880
Mainland China because about last year I knew they were going to build a 500-meter-diameter one

2249
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,420
Yes, I asked at the beginning

2250
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:42,760
Then I know it seems that he is better than the original

2251
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:45,320
It turns out that it seems to be only about 100 or 200

2252
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:46,340
diameter 300

2253
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,360
300

2254
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,440
Then his main purpose

2255
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,760
And that class should be very high

2256
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:59,400
That is, we usually say that the requirements of this mirror are closely related to its wavelength.

2257
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
This is what I just showed

2258
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
their big eyes

2259
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
this is 500 meters

2260
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Then his main thing

2261
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
The wavelength of the tube car

2262
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
The wavelength of this antenna tube car is

2263
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
possibly centimeter-scale waves

2264
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
electromagnetic waves

2265
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Then his request is like

2266
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
we do

2267
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Chihavanibo

2268
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
or visible light

2269
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
ask for this

2270
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
The superficial requirements are much worse

2271
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
So the wavelength of my surface is directly proportional to

2272
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
So let's say I can see light

2273
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I have superficial progress requirements

2274
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
This is what we call the Nami rating.

2275
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
maybe a hundred rice

2276
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
50-resistant rice

2277
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
That's because the wavelength of my optics is

2278
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
hundreds of nanometers

2279
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
so if i

2280
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
He is centimeter grade

2281
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
So he superficially asked to become Homi

2282
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Relatively speaking, the difficulty

2283
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
not that high

2284
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Of course it's because he's big

2285
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
but this

2286
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
You said you want to make the optics so big

2287
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
This is very currently not possible

2288
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Let me ask you again, how much will it cost to burn?

2289
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
this is okay

2290
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
this is what we say

2291
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
that

2292
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
i was there last week

2293
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
To him it's actually

2294
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
His reason is that the wavelength is very long

2295
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
that metal piece on his face

2296
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
It's full of holes

2297
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Because of him, everything you say is true.

2298
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
It's very heavy with a solid piece of metal

2299
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
He said it was full of holes

2300
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
full of holes

2301
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I mean, if we look from the bottom up

2302
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Nothing seems to be transparent

2303
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
it's a lot of holes

2304
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
he is whole he is whole he is string

2305
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
There are six towers outside

2306
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
His whole string is on it

2307
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
They develop a new kind of steel wire

2308
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
can lift it all up

2309
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
The quality of the steel wire is very good

2310
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
can hold a lot of weight

2311
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,640
What bridge is that pig

2312
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:03,760
What is it called Hong Kong Pig Harbor?

2313
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,040
Hong Kong-Macau Bridge

2314
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,160
the line hanging above

2315
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:07,360
developed from them

2316
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,200
They have body patents

2317
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,600
that's all

2318
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,300
hang on

2319
01:48:11,300 --> 01:48:12,200
he spent money

2320
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,100
i don't know how much it costs

2321
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,400
But after spending money like this

2322
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,760
after covering

2323
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,460
Their tourism business developed to

2324
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:18,900
money earned from tourism

2325
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,260
More money than the telescope he built

2326
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:22,600
So he now covers a lot outside

2327
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:24,040
the big hotel

2328
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:26,140
so let's see

2329
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:27,360
look at you

2330
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,000
top middle

2331
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,200
there is one that can

2332
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,400
There can be a table inside

2333
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,460
you can go up and see

2334
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:34,760
You can go outside for sightseeing

2335
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:35,760
not below

2336
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,160
can't go down

2337
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:37,900
because of our

2338
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:38,900
our sky school

2339
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:39,800
we can only be below

2340
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,700
next to that plate

2341
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,660
We can't take pictures like this

2342
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:45,600
I take a photo with my phone

2343
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:46,360
According to

2344
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:47,960
only on that plate

2345
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:49,700
about a quarter

2346
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,900
We can't take such a panorama

2347
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,160
It must be this. I don’t know how they take pictures.

2348
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:57,520
I remember taking pictures is worth billions of RMB

2349
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:58,560
billions of RMB

2350
01:48:58,620 --> 01:48:59,660
at the last meeting

2351
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:00,060
classmate

2352
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
He said he would find a few more to develop tourism

2353
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:10,000
In astronomy, he can only do specific astronomy

2354
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,000
So he is not a very broad

2355
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
ok ok sorry

2356
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
At least solve my confusion

2357
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Because a lot of people are talking about it

2358
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Is there another Mr.

2359
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Hello, Professor Wang, my name is Jin

2360
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
i want to ask

2361
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
What kind of environment is restricted in our country

2362
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Is it the land spirit or what?

2363
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Why is that very large observatory

2364
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
are abroad

2365
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
because of the old dimension

2366
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
our care for the environment

2367
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
should not lose to other

2368
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
places like nuclear camp

2369
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
i think you just walked outside

2370
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
you see us rain

2371
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Extinguish

2372
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
So Taiwan's problem is

2373
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
We have typhoon, we have rain, right?

2374
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It rains all winter in northern Taiwan

2375
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Then there will be beautiful rain and spring rain

2376
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,760
Well, the weather station, we now know it's probably

2377
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:04,760
It's a high mountain, near Yushan

2378
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:06,260
There is no way to go to Yushan

2379
01:50:06,260 --> 01:50:08,760
Yushan has no way to go up

2380
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,960
So some people may say that Yushan may

2381
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,200
The observation conditions are very good

2382
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,200
But there's really no way to get there

2383
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,200
that so

2384
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,700
in east asia

2385
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:23,600
To be honest, there isn't any table with a good temperature

2386
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,100
is east asia

2387
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:28,200
Usually because of this circulation

2388
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,600
It's all on this side of the ocean

2389
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,000
is dry

2390
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,400
is the Pacific Ocean

2391
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,100
on the right is

2392
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,200
is dry left is dead

2393
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,300
for the Atlantic Ocean

2394
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:43,000
so good weather deck

2395
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:43,900
Hawaii is an exception

2396
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:46,000
Hawaii because it is in

2397
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,900
It's an island protruding from the middle of the ocean

2398
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:51,700
So basically the airflow is very stable

2399
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:53,700
Then the clouds are all under the mountain

2400
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:55,800
Its mountain is very high, Jade Mountain is still high

2401
01:50:55,900 --> 01:50:58,800
So there is no problem above

2402
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:00,800
that's usually good when otherwise

2403
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
on the right side of the ocean

2404
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
That is, when he melts, there will be

2405
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
he doesn't melt well

2406
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
he doesn't melt well

2407
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
But he doesn't have summer when you go

2408
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
It was probably zero when I went there in July.

2409
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,000
right

2410
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
He probably asked about the humidity

2411
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
right

2412
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
right

2413
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,000
right

2414
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:39,000
But usually it's pretty dry most of the time

2415
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
is our relative humidity

2416
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
the amount of water vapor in the air

2417
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
It has a lot to do with temperature

2418
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
the more you... the higher the temperature

2419
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
air water content

2420
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I'm not talking about humidity now

2421
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
It is the amount of water in the air

2422
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
opposite to temperature

2423
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
This is when the temperature is lower

2424
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
less water content

2425
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Okay, is there any speech for today's teacher Wang?

2426
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
is there any doubt

2427
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
All right, man, because we still have a few minutes

2428
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
that give him the mic thanks

2429
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:24,000
It seems that there is a slide show about when the old Dong

2430
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Doesn't that lens follow that

2431
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Yeah

2432
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,000
What method is used to comply with this rapid change

2433
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Is it supposed to be a mechanical way?

2434
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
it's the mechanical way

2435
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It's a mechanical way, yes

2436
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
When we make this instrument

2437
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
It is we have a device called the Wayfram Sensor

2438
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
that is to say this thing

2439
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
It can detect how my wavefront has changed

2440
01:52:51,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Then I was able to control it's drive behind this mirror

2441
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,680
to allow very small changes to the surface of this mirror

2442
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:07,240
Because this mirror is very, very thin

2443
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:08,240
so it's thin

2444
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:11,560
The drive won't break when it's moving around behind it

2445
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:16,240
Can move hundreds of times per second

2446
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:20,240
This is what we call deformable mirror

2447
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:21,960
This is a special technique

2448
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,720
No one in Taiwan should be interested in this

2449
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,760
But it can move very fast

2450
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,520
This thing is actually very interesting

2451
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:32,920
It was actually developed from a new war plan.

2452
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:37,400
Americans in the 1980s

2453
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:42,400
In order to send lasers into outer space to attack artificial satellites

2454
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:44,880
He also needs to fix atmospheric labor

2455
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,760
Otherwise, they went out and said that there is no way to pile them up at one point.

2456
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:52,000
The lasers have to gather at one point to destroy this thing

2457
01:53:52,680 --> 01:53:54,840
So they went to develop the technology

2458
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,200
Then I returned the new battle plan after the end

2459
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,040
After hearing about it, he was very happy to say that this thing is very useful.

2460
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,000
just use it

2461
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,500
Yes because in fact it

2462
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,000
I'm exaggerating

2463
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,500
In fact, its animal range is very small

2464
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:10,700
Its animal range is also

2465
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,500
Also Neonometer level

2466
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,500
good obviously natural

2467
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,000
Astronomy and Natural Physics Research

2468
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,500
Natural Physics Research

2469
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:22,000
Institute of Astrophysics

2470
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,200
It is actually a cross-domain integration

2471
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,500
Need all aspects

2472
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,000
You say

2473
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,500
say hello online

2474
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,300
I want to ask something

2475
01:54:31,300 --> 01:54:34,000
Should be a basic question for you

2476
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,500
just to make sure

2477
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:40,000
So visible light observations

2478
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
usually at night

2479
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
So radio observations are

2480
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Can it be observed day and night?

2481
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,800
Yes, it depends on your wavelength

2482
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,700
That is to say

2483
01:54:50,700 --> 01:54:53,200
So usually when doing astronomical observations

2484
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:56,900
Will it observe 24 hours for radio observation?

2485
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:59,400
If it is like the mainland

2486
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,400
It can be

2487
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
But it's you when the sun comes

2488
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
This signal from the sun is still serious

2489
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
so he just said

2490
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
His time can be longer

2491
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
It is radio, for example, the CMT I just mentioned

2492
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
May be normal visible light environment

2493
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
It might close at five o'clock.

2494
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
They might get six or seven

2495
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
So when observing at night

2496
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
because I just saw

2497
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
That's why he's using a camera or

2498
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
It's just receiving light anyway

2499
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
So he will be like we see with human eyes

2500
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Just like photography

2501
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Or is it like we shoot for a long time

2502
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
For example, every ten minutes

2503
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
rerun once

2504
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
then another ten minutes

2505
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
We usually just look at

2506
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
how dark i want to see

2507
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
I do not want

2508
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
If I say I only need ten minutes

2509
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I can see what he wants

2510
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I don't want to let him lay for fifteen minutes

2511
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,480
But it can change his

2512
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:02,800
we call integration time

2513
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,240
just the time to light up

2514
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:05,720
i open the door

2515
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:07,280
Then I let him keep collecting

2516
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,240
until the time i want

2517
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:10,480
then the shutter closes

2518
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:11,880
I read the image

2519
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:13,720
That is to say, in fact

2520
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:16,280
Each observatory has a certain

2521
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,680
want to see something

2522
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:18,320
so right

2523
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,360
No, it's an astronomer

2524
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:21,120
oh oh oh

2525
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,920
It is the observatory. For example, today is me.

2526
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,120
then i want to see

2527
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:26,520
Well, let's say 15 signals

2528
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:28,720
Then 15 minutes may be fine.

2529
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:29,640
that in addition

2530
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:31,640
So the whole night is just minute by minute

2531
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:32,480
Um

2532
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,160
If I have to wait until 15

2533
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:35,880
Then I keep sending for a minute

2534
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:38,280
then i may my this one

2535
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:40,400
I am in this direction and I want to wait for 15

2536
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:41,680
Then I have to wait 20 in the other direction

2537
01:56:41,680 --> 01:56:42,600
then i will

2538
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:43,640
going to change

2539
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:46,000
So I have to do the math in advance

2540
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,080
Good thing I'm in this one

2541
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,640
Uh, when the observatory knows this direction

2542
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,240
how long do i have to lay

2543
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:53,920
Then go to how long you have the angle to lay

2544
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:54,880
in this way

2545
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,320
that is to say

2546
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:57,440
if run out

2547
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:59,560
visible light telescope

2548
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:00,440
there is no way

2549
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,040
Observing the galaxy between the sun and the earth in France

2550
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,160
is not a galaxy

2551
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,600
Just like Mercury or something.

2552
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:10,600
Uh, of course because the sun and the earth

2553
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,440
The earth revolves around the sun

2554
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:15,640
So what's behind the sun changes

2555
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:17,880
Right, so that means if you use visible light

2556
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:21,440
You can only observe at night, you can only look away

2557
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,680
yes yes but because

2558
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:26,880
The earth revolves around the sun

2559
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,280
So I can still see in all directions

2560
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,560
I think it's a different time of year

2561
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,160
I can see the sky in different places

2562
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:36,880
The sun is not always with the earth

2563
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:40,720
pointing in the same direction

2564
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:43,420
Say you are the sun and I am the earth

2565
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:45,420
I'm looking at my back now, right?

2566
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:46,680
i can see this sky now

2567
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:49,960
Then I arrived three months later I look here

2568
01:57:49,960 --> 01:57:51,360
I can look over there in three months

2569
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:52,120
Yes, yes, see again

2570
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:54,960
i mean

2571
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:58,880
The galaxies between the sun and the earth

2572
01:57:58,880 --> 01:57:59,980
oh those stars

2573
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,040
Yes, for example, the southern star is very early or very late

2574
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:04,400
there is still a way

2575
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,400
That is, it is at a very small angle from the sun

2576
01:58:07,700 --> 01:58:09,340
but that angle is small

2577
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:11,640
Still big on astronomical scales

2578
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,400
we can still see

2579
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:15,840
That is, the range usually taken by astronomy is very small.

2580
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:18,500
Yes, like the moon

2581
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,540
Let's say the moon is 0.5 degrees

2582
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:24,540
0.5 degrees is already a very wide angle for astronomical observation

2583
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:27,540
Okay, thank you

2584
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:29,240
good

2585
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:31,740
I think I've tuned myself into a play lock

2586
01:58:31,740 --> 01:58:33,440
I should study astronomy

2587
01:58:34,340 --> 01:58:37,140
Okay, it's about 9 o'clock now

2588
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:41,340
Then thank you, thank you very much, Mr. Wang, today is very exciting

2589
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,740
then let's give him a break too

2590
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,940
So with our warmest applause

2591
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:46,840
Thank you Wang Xiaoyu Mr. Wang

2592
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:47,740
thank you all

2593
01:58:47,740 --> 01:58:50,020
Then I also tell you

2594
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:51,140
announce

2595
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,340
that the next speech will be given by

2596
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:55,340
this is a plant

2597
01:58:55,340 --> 01:58:59,240
Illumination and researcher at the Institute of Parasitology

2598
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:00,040
he wants to talk

2599
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,240
The title of his talk was Exploring the Mysteries of Plant Sexual Reproduction

2600
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:08,640
At that time, I hope everyone can participate enthusiastically

2601
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:10,480
thank you all thank you today

2602
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:13,280
I came here among my king, thank you all

2603
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,040
Thanks

2604
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:19,080
Thank you, all the guests, for coming to our popular science lecture today.

2605
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:20,560
to make the event better
