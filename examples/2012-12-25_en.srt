1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Come to talk to you about the latest academic research and scientific development

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Today I am very happy and honored to invite a researcher from the China Wen Zhe Institute of our school

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Come to talk with you about China's first vernacular Bible

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
From the seventh ninth year to the eighth year

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Dr. Lee is a Master of English Literature from Commonwealth University

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
PhD in Comparative Literature, University of Skagow

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Establishment Day Education Department of English, Soochow University Institute of Comparative Literature, Pujin University

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
National Shiwan University English Institute and Translation Institute

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He is now a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He is also a Professor of Peace at the Translation Institute of Normal University

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and agricultural researcher at the Translation Center of the Chinese University of Hong Kong

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He is more familiar with engineering than Professor

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
so i shouldn't have read this

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
However, Professor Li has won many farmer awards including young assistants from our hospital.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Soochow University Outstanding Campus Tour Award

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He just heard that he also gave lectures when he was competing for general universities and book schools

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I lost to Cai Yinglin, so there is nothing wrong with this

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In 2010 and 2011, all translation research papers commemorative awards were sent

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
and National Science Council and Book Research Award, etc.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, Professor Aristotle's education is rich

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Know six or seven languages

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then the writing waits for students

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, his works include Chinese and Western Civilization English People

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Late Ming Dynasty in China to Middle Ages in Europe

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Qingming Jesuit Western Classical Administrative Road Story Exam

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Mingming Jesuits Translating Literature and Other Books

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And he has translated a lot of books, I want to say that I don't mean to read them here

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But I recently saw a comment

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I said, I can't see it, I just can see it

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then this comment thinks that he is the one who studies the translated literature of the late Ming Dynasty all over the world.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
first person, then i'll paraphrase here

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But he didn't get a chance to read this comment

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So it can be seen that his translation in the late Ming Dynasty

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So because the book will matter, this translation

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This history has a very important and authoritative position

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
do a lot of work on this

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
including very detailed

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Restrain this late Ming game-like translation of the classic

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Although I still have to speak publicly

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I advised him not to live so carefully

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I've been told this by him

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But these jobs are very big jobs

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and it takes time

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is the case in all aspects of knowledge and physical strength

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Unprecedented 8 project investment

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We also hope he gets these things done soon

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Professor of Governance also served as Telephone Newspaper

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
"China Times"

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The Sino-British Daily has only Times columns and Su Ping writers

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So I guess his name is familiar to you all

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Although you still have to ask me at noon today

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Should I Study Liliology or Lishuangxue?

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
we are the word is very old

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The word "Military" in the above book is the word

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
so this

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Today's speech is actually

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You said it was mentioned in a small talk with me once

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,740
I think this topic is very suitable

59
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,740
I didn't expect to arrange the left arrangement and the right arrangement

60
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,740
It's a coincidence that it's scheduled for Christmas today.

61
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,600
this is totally unexpected

62
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Because the small root of knowledge is Tuesday

63
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
so tuesday

64
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,800
Christmas

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Attach your first "Vernacular Bible"

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,100
it's a match made in heaven

67
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
We also give a big round of applause to welcome everyone

68
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Thank you Vice President Wang today

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,700
I don't want to be sorry today

70
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
I compare why

71
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,200
I usually feel like I have a cold

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,200
But it's stupid to talk about it

73
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,500
started yesterday

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Before I ask you, I figured it out myself

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,100
but say so

76
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
He might be more magnetic

77
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,100
I have a self-deprecating place

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,100
what i'm going to talk about today

79
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,100
After the first "Vernacular Bible"

80
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,700
Is a Chinese Jesuit

81
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,800
He Qingtai

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,240
OK He Jintao said he translated it

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,440
this is a very interesting person

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,140
I'll talk more about him later

85
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,540
before talking about him i think

86
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,420
The first of our Academia Sinica to come to Taiwan

87
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,280
The first dean, Mr. Hu Shizhi

88
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,440
start from the beginning

89
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,440
OK Hu Shiyou is very respectful

90
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,320
At this time, this person who can step into the academic hall

91
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,640
Actually, I think personally

92
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,620
The key is the influence of Hu Shi OK

93
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,980
this Hushi

94
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,020
I probably read Hu Shi's book when I was in high school

95
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,380
One of the things Hu Shi said in your book

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
recent in 50 years

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But it is spoken in English

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
OK

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So life in English is pushed back 50 years

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The vernacular novel of this life is

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Vernacular literature in the past 1000 years

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
has the same big drawback

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That is to say, the adoption of vernacular

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
still meaningless

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
meaningful

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
doesn't make sense

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
in other words

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
if no english is spoken

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
this story thinks before it

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This use of vernacular

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
is a

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
is a

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How to say

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If it is not a product of the bookstore

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
then it is

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Chat until there is no Jinshi

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
or those who raise people

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
the literati

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then pick up the pen

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Initiate old income

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
write a novel

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
OK

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
this

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
so is a

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
unconsciously

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
written in vernacular here

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
writing

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hu Shi is greater than consciousness, probably like this

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
so for him

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
these people

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
write this vernacular

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
neither

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
conclusively in writing

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
ok

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
not conscious

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I want to create in vernacular

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
or to write

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
this

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
i miss him

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
he thought before

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
people are not like this

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but i personally

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
before

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
did not touch this

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Mingjing

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Before this work of the Society of Jesus

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What is Hu Shi talking about?

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
because he asks him again

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I just want to ask him something

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Later I realized that

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hu Shi said this

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
seems a little too much

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
a little too fast

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
ok

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I personally at this point in time

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There are many things that are not necessarily their own

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In fact, not yet

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
no one has seen it in a

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
OK

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
so

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is also extenuating

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
OK

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The one about He Qiantai that I want to talk about today

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
old and new bible

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
not such a book

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
so-called unintentional

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So-called

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
this translated bible

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
but

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Intentional

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
use vernacular

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to translate the bible

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And this vernacular

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
i don't know use this baby

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Although He Qiantai lives in Beijing

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
OK

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
he is

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
he is

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
he is the jesuit history of france

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
but

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
he arrived when he was very young

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
this one

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Centaur

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
OK

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
so he

187
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
he calls himself this

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Italian

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
is better than his this

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How to say

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
here in french

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
much better

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
OK

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
When he came to China

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
he put this

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
when he was first

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
actually

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
because we need to know something

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
this china

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
in the qing dynasty

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Mandarin

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
not us today

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
the so-called national language

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
ok or the so-called Beijing dialect in mainland China

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The national language of the Qing Dynasty was Manchu

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
ok is manchu

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
When you come to China

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
his first

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What about translating the above attempts

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's Manchu

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
this attempt of the bible

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Then wait until he finishes the Manchu Bible

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
he just started

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The nerve to do Chinese

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
ok

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The Chinese nerve

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't think it's a

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How to say

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
commonly known as

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Beijing Guanhua

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
ok a language like this

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,720
i am not a linguist

223
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,160
But I always feel that visualization is a class language

224
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,040
OK

225
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,720
The one that talks about visualization

226
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,680
you sooner or later

227
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,000
You are even in the aspect of intonation

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
I'm afraid it's all

229
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
must have that

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
this kind of knowledge

231
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,080
a certain level of knowledge

232
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,440
then he will speak

233
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,160
OK

234
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,720
Then even if you live in Beijing

235
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
You may not be talking about this so-called visualization

236
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,920
but he was writing

237
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,520
For example, when writing this Le Tuo box

238
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,880
The so-called Beijing Tuyu

239
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
OK

240
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,760
Graphics are a little harder to hear

241
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,920
Let's speak Beijing Shuyu

242
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,760
OK

243
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,440
The Beijing Shuyu written by He Jinla

244
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,720
when he writes well

245
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,240
really great

246
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,960
OK

247
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,440
let's see the next one

248
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,960
Let me check this one from He Jinla first.

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,480
this person is good

250
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,200
This He Jinla's

251
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,460
It is now China from 1770

252
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,500
its actually a generation of jesuits

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,340
The end of the article is in Xinrong because

254
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,500
Its point in time is already

255
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
to this former farmer

256
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,240
If you count the first generation of Jesuits

257
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,300
That should be counted immediately

258
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,700
That was around 1588, 283

259
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Feature Master 1770's

260
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,000
It's hundreds of years away from this

261
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,700
ok

262
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,900
so in the middle

263
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,700
In fact, China has gone through that kind of

264
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,200
religious tolerance

265
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,100
Then next to bondage religion

266
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,700
ok

267
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,200
Then just ban you Catholic

268
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,500
this one goes into china

269
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,300
ok

270
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,500
that but

271
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Although it says access to prohibit this

272
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Off home is forbidden

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Catholicism enters China

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But the Catholic Church is telling the truth

275
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
did not die

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He became an underground frontrunner

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's very active underground

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Thousand yuan is to drive out some missionaries

279
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
but then again

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If your calendar is very good

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
very good at math

282
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
very good legislation

283
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
astronomy is very good

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Shenzhen understands painting

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Even if these people are the most severe warriors

286
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He also let them stay in this coffin

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So in the coffin forest

288
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I raised a group of so-called generals from the West

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
or painter

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you drink brilliantly

291
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
when you come to china

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,100
He probably never thought that he would be a flower stand

293
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,660
just because he's a little

294
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,220
this talent in painting

295
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,000
OK not a little big

296
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,320
talent for painting

297
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,180
So when he arrived in Beijing, people asked him what he was doing

298
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,740
He made this one Latin very well

299
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,760
OK

300
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,580
Then China with this one

301
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,680
There is often that kind of border diplomacy with Russia

302
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,960
trade or

303
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,260
Even the question of national borders

304
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,600
So he often intervenes in this Secondary School

305
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,620
this

306
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,400
trade or

307
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,720
some political issues

308
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,020
translated a lot of this

309
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,320
something specialized becomes latin

310
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,620
show this two

311
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,400
OK

312
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,960
Of course I don't know how his biography is.

313
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,980
but

314
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,280
once wanted to join

315
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,320
Russian Jesuits

316
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,100
OK

317
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,380
that anyway

318
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,880
let's answer him

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
His identity as a chemist

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,580
He is the descendant of the so-called Hercynian faction

321
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,580
a hercynian is actually a

322
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,580
Haixi is from the west

323
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,580
The west of the sea is here

324
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,080
In fact, it was Wolf Shilin who shouted it out.

325
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Or because of Wolf Shilin when they were talking

326
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,080
The inscription is Hercynian wolf-style forest

327
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,080
So there was such a so-called Hercynian

328
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,080
He Jintai is the last member of this faction.

329
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
When they came to China in 1776

330
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Wolf Forest has been lost for five years

331
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,080
So He Jintai has never seen this wolf-style forest

332
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
But He Jintai

333
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Earlier, Wang Licheng asked He Jintai and said

334
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,080
You go to imitate this wolf forest or something

335
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
include this one

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Bai Juntu

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Bai Juntu also sent

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
make this

339
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
have voted

340
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
including Bai Juntu

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He Juntu is more than you

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
so

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He Juntu is thousands of kilometers away

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
calculate

345
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you want to compare with Wang Shilin

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
he's not first class

347
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Huajia

348
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
not much sister in law

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
also for this

350
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
how do you say

351
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
one in court

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Emphasis on location

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
one of Hu Jintao's

354
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
he wrote a book called

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Picture Record of the Imperial Court

356
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He Jintai

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Donglin Mao

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That is to say, he is good at drawing

359
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
this painted bird

360
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
OK to draw a bird

361
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
what bird

362
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I didn't understand the nouns

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
called Haiqing

364
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
blue is the love of blue sky

365
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
OK

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,500
Later, the seascape paper used to look up the dictionary was old silver or something like that.

367
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
So I showed a picture of this one

368
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Lao Yin painted by He Jintai is over there

369
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Except for this old silver

370
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,500
He Jintai actually painted many other things

371
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
In addition, I found another record of this painting by him.

372
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
we can see

373
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
In fact, in a certain sense of the Hercynian school

374
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,500
It is a combination of Chinese painting and Western painting

375
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I am not an art history researcher

376
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
That's probably all we're talking about

377
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
I also know He Jin

378
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
did you say we must be free

379
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Words from Gu Gong Museum Area

380
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Mr. Gu's office and Father Wu

381
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Our Taipei Gugong

382
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I don't know Mr. Gu in mainland China

383
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
He has a martial father to Mr. Gu

384
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
This painting by He Jintai

385
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
So He Jintai

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,780
as the artist

387
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:11,160
In the Qing Palace, the interaction with the emperor is relatively large

388
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,040
OK

389
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,440
that in private

390
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,220
sorry

391
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,380
Another concern is the translation

392
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,940
during diplomatic translation

393
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,260
he is always doing one thing

394
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,120
OK

395
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,340
private translation

396
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,460
Of course it's to fuck them

397
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,340
sorry

398
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:33,140
do their own bible translations

399
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,480
i just said

400
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,220
This Manchu is the national language of the Qing Dynasty

401
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,780
so

402
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,660
this He Jintai

403
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,140
Of course it's drawn from 1770

404
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,620
After painting in 1770

405
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,700
he started this bible

406
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,820
you can change it

407
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's not it

408
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
no

409
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,440
There is a Date

410
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,040
Ok,Date

411
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Ok

412
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,680
he probably

413
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,080
Come to China in 1770 I think

414
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,560
He has to learn Manchu

415
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,520
Ok, so it's probably impossible to say

416
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,400
Since 1770

417
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,680
This translation, this Manchu Bible

418
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Ok

419
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,880
but for some

420
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,520
words spoken by a language genius

421
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,960
I think

422
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Well

423
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,520
It is also difficult for us to say that he cannot be within three to five years

424
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,880
uh at least after some degree of this manchu

425
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,000
Manchu in all aspects should be a kind of

426
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,480
flat phonetic characters, i don't understand

427
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,400
Ok, but I just because he should be a

428
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,480
Plain letters

429
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,880
So under this Chinese

430
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,680
Well

431
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,080
This country and scriptures from flat-yin script

432
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
probably for Manchu

433
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,540
should be

434
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,860
It is also easier to enter the situation

435
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,620
OK

436
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,660
so

437
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,200
this

438
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,240
when did he start translating manchu

439
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,040
We don't know about the bible

440
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,820
so full bible

441
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,880
manuscript now

442
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,900
not herbal

443
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,920
manuscript

444
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,000
It's in Japan's Toyo Bunko

445
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,300
I don't know why and where I went

446
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,060
OK

447
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,380
Then the Japanese Toyo Bunko

448
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,160
The title given is called

449
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,700
Manchu complex

450
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,780
new covenant victory book

451
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,100
I want to say that you will not belong to He Jintao

452
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,660
his title

453
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,420
OK

454
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,980
I don't know what happened to his title

455
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,840
Completed this Manchu Bible in 1790

456
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,160
This is certain because

457
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,480
He Jin has a friend

458
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,560
This once wrote a letter saying

459
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,180
In 1790, He Jindai completed the translation of the Manchu Bible

460
00:19:59,440 --> 00:19:59,940
OK

461
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,420
so it's very, very clear

462
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,040
You have to wait until the translation of the Manchu scriptures is finished

463
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,800
You put the most important thing in the Qing Dynasty

464
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,120
That is to say, the most important thing for Qing people is Manchu

465
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
after you've done it

466
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,200
You might just say come back

467
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,480
How do you say this

468
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,160
to deal with this

469
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,280
In fact, there are many more Han Chinese than Manchurians

470
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,880
OK

471
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,760
so

472
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,240
The earliest he could have been in the 1790s

473
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,400
early 1790

474
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,040
or 1790

475
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,240
He can start translating

476
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,120
this

477
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,600
this nerve in Chinese

478
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,480
OK

479
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,600
So

480
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,600
very interesting

481
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,400
exist

482
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,640
This horse bean of the New Testament

483
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,400
Wanyue Green means Gospel

484
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,240
this

485
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,400
this saint

486
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,080
holy

487
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
I don't think so

488
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
i say

489
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
San Matthew

490
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
OK

491
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It is the Gospel of Madou

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
When he was translating a gospel of horse beans

493
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
has a comment

494
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
write to say

495
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
1800

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Dokei

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
this i think

498
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Impossible 1800 Daoist

499
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
this should be in the middle

500
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
he is missing a word

501
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
or super person this

502
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
one word missing

503
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It should be one hundred and eighteen hundred years ago

504
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Dokei

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
OK

506
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
so

507
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
this

508
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
We can probably imagine that

509
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
this He Jintai

510
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
should be

511
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
in the 19th century

512
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
this one

513
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that one

514
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that one

515
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The moment the eighteenth turned to the nineteenth century

516
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
OK

517
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
he officially translated

518
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
this new music

519
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
OK

520
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
what about old music

521
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I started translating a long time ago

522
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He flipped a lot of this old music

523
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
OK

524
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
text also disappeared

525
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Well said

526
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,200
In total he actually translated

527
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,980
If according to this Chinese volume

528
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,700
how to say this word

529
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,400
He translated a total of 36 volumes

530
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,100
But what about the 36 volumes

531
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,700
This roll cannot be brought

532
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,800
the book of the bible

533
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,100
Equal and close

534
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Because if the word in the Bible is written in English

535
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
It's called Bokeh

536
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Libbe in Latin

537
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,100
so

538
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,800
36 Chinese Rolls by He Jintao

539
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,100
is equal to this western bible

540
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,600
About 56, 7 Bokeh

541
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,600
ok

542
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,300
this

543
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,800
talking about being catholic

544
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sure you must know that

545
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,300
catholic this one

546
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,300
as far as

547
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,900
what you believe

548
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
this one

549
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,560
The so-called homeless big bible

550
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,880
OK Homeless Large Bible

551
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,680
What about the Big Homeless Bible?

552
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,760
It's very different from this Protestant Bible.

553
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,520
OK

554
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,840
The Big Homeless Bible has 73 volumes in total

555
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,880
OK

556
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,680
So he translated 567 volumes

557
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,240
These 36 volumes are equal to 567 volumes

558
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,040
Homeless Big Book, this Bible

559
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,080
In fact, only a small part remains

560
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,640
This one didn't turn over

561
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
OK

562
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,740
He is not only in a translation of the bible

563
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,560
He also commented on the Bible

564
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,340
OK Commentary Bible

565
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,620
so

566
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,920
Inside the 36 volumes

567
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,720
36 volumes

568
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,300
When I go to the academic association, I often say that when I go to see this one.

569
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,600
I found it was volume 36

570
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,420
uh how to say we come back

571
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,220
do the math

572
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,520
More than 1.5 million words

573
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,280
OK

574
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,080
More than 1.5 million words

575
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,340
how many money

576
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,840
how many money

577
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
When this agent completes this is at least 36 rolls

578
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
OK, it is still a difficult time to scrutinize

579
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
about the only way we can say

580
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
make a little guess

581
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Probably around 1805

582
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
why i say 1805

583
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
because in 1803

584
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
He Jinnai once wrote a letter to the Holy See, but the letter did not go

585
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Catholicism is different from ordinary Christian denominations

586
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Catholicism is a centralized and large system

587
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You don't understand anything in theory

588
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,400
I think I should get to the Holy See

589
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
there is the Holy See

590
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,580
Especially when the pope decides to say

591
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,180
can

592
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,000
OK

593
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
so

594
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,480
He Jinnaita

595
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,840
After reversing thirty-six volumes

596
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,280
he wrote

597
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,680
in 1803

598
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,600
He wrote to the Holy See

599
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,280
explain

600
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
Can I limit my subjects?

601
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,880
I dug it out now

602
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,080
Thirty-six volumes

603
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,880
OK

604
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
He Jinnai is very

605
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,960
I think he might be more

606
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,360
naive

607
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,080
he should know

608
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,720
The Magic Horse Church is actually

609
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,960
If i remember correctly

610
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,760
around 1612

611
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,960
OK

612
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,600
the pope

613
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,920
just ban

614
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,960
This is in various dialects

615
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,880
That is to say, the national languages ​​of various countries

616
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,320
to translate this nerve

617
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,080
only one nerve

618
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,600
Not Hebrew

619
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,040
Nor is it Greek

620
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,160
OK is Latin

621
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,820
So why did He Jinnai not gamble?

622
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,660
That is to say no gambling in the ban of 1612

623
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,020
This he went to China

624
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,660
he translates nerves over there

625
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,780
this is an interesting question

626
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,220
But I can't give you an answer

627
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,020
I can only say that He Jinnai's first one might be a little too naive

628
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,980
Because the Holy See has lifted the ban

629
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,140
Because it's been a long time

630
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:41,620
Now it makes sense to think so.

631
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:48,320
Because the few Western missionaries who were in Beijing at that time

632
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,660
In fact, they are under strict supervision.

633
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,620
OK

634
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,260
you can't talk nonsense

635
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,980
OK

636
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,620
You can only go to and from get off work every day

637
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
get off work

638
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,660
ok you are a painter

639
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,800
ok, then you go to this Ruyi Pavilion in Yueming Garden every day

640
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,440
to draw

641
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,240
What about painting culture?

642
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,940
you should go home

643
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,000
ok then you want this one to write back to this one's home country

644
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,840
ok your family and so on

645
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,240
you can't say like we write now

646
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,340
Write something and I will lose this mailbox

647
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,740
ok no such thing

648
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,940
ok, you have to send it to a unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs

649
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,440
There's nothing wrong with checking from there

650
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,980
ok of course

651
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,700
uh you didn't write this one

652
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,880
say now

653
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,240
uh its italian better than french

654
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,740
ok if you want to write in italian

655
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,540
probably no one over there will be able to check his italian

656
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Uh, but maybe go to another Jesuit

657
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,280
What does it mean

658
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,780
say something in it

659
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,680
ok finished speaking, if there is no problem

660
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
Oh, let this letter go

661
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,820
You can go back to this Italian area

662
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
In this situation, if you think about it

663
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,540
How many letters can he write in English?

664
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,220
Each letter is covered by this party membership

665
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,120
or every letter is checked

666
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,340
His English is actually very limited.

667
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,840
Once, once, there was a man named Detianshi

668
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:27,040
A Catholic missionary who forgot his nationality

669
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,060
He has not been taught

670
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,860
Sorry, this clear procedure

671
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,100
he took this one

672
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,100
This letter from several missionaries

673
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,500
I want to say, OK, I will entrust another Chinese

674
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,940
Because he is going to the EU

675
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,140
OK, I will entrust him, when this one goes to the EU

676
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,380
By the way, please send me this letter from the European Union.

677
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,260
send it, all right

678
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,060
This becomes a Jia Qingxiang

679
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
the very famous Detus case

680
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
OK

681
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Detianshi did it because of this

682
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
he was old

683
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
OK

684
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
sent this heat

685
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Go to the South China Sea to share hardships

686
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It took five or six years to return to Beijing

687
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So they were

688
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
in Beijing

689
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Although it is said that East, West, North and South Church

690
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But this kind of connection with the Holy See

691
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Actually not very strong

692
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So I miss Mrs. He Jin

693
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
she doesn't know

694
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
For example, the Holy See is

695
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Unban or not yet

696
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
she is in beijing anyway

697
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
she's fine

698
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
She came home after painting

699
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
except for a prayer

700
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll just be there the rest of the time

701
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
How to say

702
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
over there this translation

703
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Bible

704
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
This must also be correct

705
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
a very

706
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
a wrong concept

707
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I just say

708
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,840
the old missionary

709
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,040
It doesn't seem to translate this nerve

710
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,440
OK Protestants don’t understand this old religion very much.

711
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,160
OK, many scholars actually meet the requirements

712
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,200
This Protestant saying

713
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,080
OK I want to look at it from an academic point of view

714
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,280
Guxin's nerves came out today

715
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,440
We should say there is nothing wrong old teacher

716
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,400
Of course, this nerve has not been given rights and interests to complete

717
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,000
But someone from the old teacher had that motive

718
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,440
have that attempt

719
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,720
OK have that attempt

720
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,000
he wants rights

721
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,360
This martial arts Osaka this nerve

722
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,600
this nerve of their belief

723
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,640
ok so i figured this out

724
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,760
possible

725
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,000
The neuroresearch community

726
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,160
I need to go to the hearing for a while

727
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
the old idea

728
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
OK

729
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
just mentioned that is to say

730
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
because I really don't know

731
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
hello christmas when is this

732
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
How can I say it? It's hard to understand.

733
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
OK

734
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I can probably only speculate that

735
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
He sent this letter in 1803

736
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
With the traffic conditions at that time

737
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
In 1803, there were no booster ships

738
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
OK

739
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The booster ship may have come around 1820

740
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
OK

741
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
so he should be

742
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It should be this general this

743
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
normal ship

744
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
OK

745
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That

746
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
this letter

747
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
To pray from this pan-terrestrial tank of this Chinese offering

748
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
In fact, I will calculate for him

749
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It should be at least two years

750
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
OK for two years

751
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So even if he is 1805

752
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
OK

753
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
36 donations for his pan-terrestrial tank

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,560
but a little worried

755
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,240
OK

756
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,940
Give him another three years

757
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,040
so i this

758
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,480
I said lower limit

759
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,480
maybe 1808

760
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,080
how can i say maybe

761
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,040
to 1790

762
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,120
is almost a certain point in time

763
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,000
OK

764
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,320
That's because

765
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,360
He is in this period

766
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,000
In the past ten years

767
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,840
He turned the whole date over.

768
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,640
what about the new covenant

769
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,000
In fact, most of them are translated

770
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,840
OK

771
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,520
And the translation is quite interesting

772
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,840
i think we can take a look

773
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,840
This picture of the new testament is good

774
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,000
OK

775
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This is what we call Genesis

776
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
what we call genesis today

777
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,960
the word creation

778
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,560
I haven't done my research

779
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,840
but i'm going to answer

780
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
possibly from

781
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,500
Luewen turned around

782
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
OK

783
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
I don't know very well

784
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
OK

785
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
but

786
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
What about He Jintai?

787
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
I'm sure he's a bible

788
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
someone who knows very well

789
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
because

790
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,500
Today's biblical studies

791
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,500
research community

792
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
often think that say ah

793
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
this

794
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
this

795
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
What about Genesis?

796
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
There are actually two stories

797
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
pieced together

798
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
OK

799
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
That

800
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,000
What about He Jintai?

801
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
he put this

802
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
This Genesis

803
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,000
He is a brave protector

804
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
honestly

805
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
his genesis he divided

806
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,500
one knife two paragraphs

807
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,000
just cut in two

808
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
two

809
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
two volumes

810
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
OK

811
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,500
god made man

812
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
everything else

813
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He is called the gene of formation

814
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
OK

815
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Of course it turns into these two words

816
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
turned into heaven and earth

817
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
This saying should come from the Yijing

818
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Painted as heaven and earth or waist

819
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
this one from over there

820
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
After this human being begins to recover

821
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Create a variety of different carriages

822
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
utensils

823
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
etc

824
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Then this face-changing of human beings themselves

825
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Abraham's fingering and all that stuff

826
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
what about that part

827
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
It's called the Sutra of Creation

828
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
OK

829
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So in a sense

830
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I miss He Jinnai

831
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
He Jinnai is more sensitive

832
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Actually cut the bible like this

833
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't believe it after that

834
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
If he said that the preaching of the Roman Way

835
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
This copy of an Old New Bible

836
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
If there are people who know Chinese in the Roman Road

837
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I can't believe this one they will unify

838
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
This publication of this book

839
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
OK

840
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
He still burns him out

841
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
no matter what

842
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
we see

843
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
He Jindai

844
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
he this

845
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
new moon night

846
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Employment? It's about the same.

847
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
then this is

848
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We are all familiar

849
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So I edited this picture out

850
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
you can see

851
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
this

852
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
at first

853
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
At first it was

854
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
From martial arts to heaven and earth

855
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Then the earth is empty and bare

856
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
dark shadow

857
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
on extremely deep surface

858
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Holy Spirit

859
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
walking on water

860
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
this i think

861
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
If there are Christians doing this again

862
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
to this

863
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This paragraph should be

864
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
more familiar than me

865
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
OK

866
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Fighting dead is the Latin Deus

867
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
OK

868
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
In fact, it is the consciousness of God

869
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that's actually

870
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000

871
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,460
Nemesis generation this era

872
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,120
He is actually not supposed to use Shake Corpse

873
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,520
he used god

874
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,960
He should have used the word God

875
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,700
OK

876
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,320
Because it was still in the Ming Dynasty in 1627

877
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,160
in 1627

878
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,920
this

879
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,500
Some of the larger

880
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,160
The more important one is the Jesuit

881
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
For example, like Long Huangping

882
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,120
high character

883
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,320
Jin Yige wait for these Jesuits

884
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,040
When they were in 1627

885
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,960
they are in the family this one

886
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,480
Shanghai

887
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,600
Shanghai family place

888
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,680
where they meet

889
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,120
11 Jesuits

890
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
in 1627

891
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,480
Xu Guang's early days

892
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,280
Yang Tingwen, they are still there

893
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
they also practice

894
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,360
give opinions

895
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,400
they debate over there

896
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,180
OK

897
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,720
What are you arguing about?

898
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
OK, low big evil

899
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
How exactly should I translate

900
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
OK, how to translate

901
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Are you going to translate to this one

902
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Well

903
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
uh god

904
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
or translated as God

905
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
OK, uh, or translated into

906
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
uh, you just use

907
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
English translation

908
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
are you calling it

909
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Doos and Fighters

910
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
English is similar, or you want

911
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Hurry up and call Doos

912
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
OK, uh, I want

913
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
anyway, uh

914
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
this one two thousand years

915
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
These people reached the final conclusion

916
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
yes

917
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
uh, this, they have been

918
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
win, ok, that is to say

919
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
uh, they think this

920
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Doos should be translated as God

921
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
OK, that

922
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
What about Luo Wenning's faction?

923
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It was a failure because Luo Wenning

924
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This pie, then I am Chinese

925
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
There is no equivalent to this Doos at all

926
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
this concept of this

927
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
uh uh

928
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
name

929
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,000
So Meng Wanping insisted that

930
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Since there is no

931
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,500
Then it should be translated in a responsive way

932
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,000
OK

933
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's just that Meng Wanping doesn't

934
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
did not succeed

935
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
this He Jintai

936
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
possible

937
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
when he translated

938
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Maybe he has his own considerations

939
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
OK

940
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
When he translated this Deus

941
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
he always

942
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
still

943
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He followed Meng Wanping

944
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He translates as a Deus

945
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Translated into a Dou Shi Dou Sister

946
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
only when encountering some

947
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
When not the word Deus

948
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
He will switch to other usage

949
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
for example

950
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Deus

951
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The word Deus

952
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Dominus

953
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
In fact, it is the consciousness of the Lord

954
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
ok main

955
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the Lord

956
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the master

957
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,960
How am I aware?

958
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,160
Like Dominionist, he turned it into this group

959
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,500
Sometimes he is different into the upper group

960
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,700
this

961
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,160
he is all we know

962
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,800
Until now

963
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
first discussed in China

964
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,500
This so-called Teachable Grammation

965
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,960
the first person with a so-called very good question

966
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,560
Although it is said that Mohangnian had already started to debate in 1627

967
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,560
But this person who will discuss all the holy names

968
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,660
is the core station

969
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,660
he even

970
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
I don't like the ones in the middle

971
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:52,160
He's even in one of his teaching assistants for the Paleo Bible

972
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
He said

973
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,460
this

974
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,060
this Java

975
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,160
Whether you can still fire in a night

976
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,400
Or modern people change their name to Yahweh

977
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,960
He Jin told you

978
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,600
This Dos warrior has no tacit understanding of this name

979
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,440
In fact, the name is from the 16th century.

980
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,480
just synthesized a name

981
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,800
Protestants have been using this name

982
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,860
so you're in the old bible

983
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,960
The name Jehovah cannot be found

984
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:36,860
He Jin did a lot of this type of work anyway

985
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,940
So I said that within 1.5 million words

986
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,780
About a quarter of them are annotations

987
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,620
This quarter of the note is very important

988
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,460
Because after China succeeded Yang Maluo

989
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,500
Yang Marlowe's Straightforward Explanation of the Bible

990
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,840
that is not a complete bible

991
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,860
that's part of the bible

992
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,900
Bible Straightforward

993
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,800
After that, in a very large Bible

994
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Refer to a book with a lot of annotations

995
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,100
So I think this is

996
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,700
if i'm free that day

997
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,200
I want to write an article called "He Jintai's Theory of Lifting the Ban"

998
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
because I feel that some places

999
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,800
He Jintai may have told them the interpretation of the Church of Rome

1000
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
there is some distance

1001
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
he has his own opinion

1002
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Let alone coming to China

1003
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
It's unlikely that you don't have your own opinion.

1004
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,800
That text by He Jintai

1005
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,800
what is it like

1006
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,800
I think we'll look at this first

1007
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
"Holy Mother Hopes for You" Mo Zhimeng is ready

1008
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
This is the preface of his "No Spirit Sutra"

1009
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
This is also the prologue

1010
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
In total he wrote two parts of this preface to the Old and New Bibles

1011
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,680
He even how the Bible should be typeset

1012
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,480
We call typesetting today

1013
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,480
He made it very clear

1014
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,980
you want to add one line you want to add two lines

1015
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,980
you want a frame

1016
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
where to use small print

1017
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,480
In fact, he made it very clear in his preamble.

1018
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
But what?

1019
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,480
What I value most is the dream of St. Gerald and Ning Lonely

1020
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
this place

1021
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,480
St. Geraldine

1022
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
this may be unfamiliar

1023
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
non-religious people wait

1024
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
Non-religious people should be familiar with a name called

1025
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
Sanger Room

1026
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Sanger Room

1027
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
holy

1028
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
Jer Room

1029
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Anyway

1030
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,480
Shengre Luo Ning Lone is the Sanger Room

1031
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Definitely this one of the five big bibles

1032
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
How do you say this

1033
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Interested person

1034
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
ok

1035
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That Kowloon

1036
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
this

1037
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It is said

1038
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That Kowloon is a very good Latin guy

1039
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
ok

1040
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That

1041
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It is said that he

1042
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
When we start translating the Bible

1043
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well he is the same as this

1044
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
a very beautiful this

1045
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The problem with Cicero

1046
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
translate this bible

1047
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
ok

1048
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
ok

1049
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That

1050
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
this bible

1051
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Can you translate like this?

1052
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
this is a big problem

1053
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'll miss him later

1054
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Then anyway when he translates like this

1055
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
How long has it been?

1056
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Eh

1057
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
we say so

1058
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
one day he was sleeping

1059
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
ok

1060
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
in sleep

1061
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
god god nerve

1062
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,500
turned into an angel today

1063
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,000
just a few angels

1064
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,500
that's a whip

1065
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,500
You guys still have mace

1066
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,000
this philosophy

1067
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
then hit him

1068
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,500
Hit until you hit this mixed injury

1069
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,000
While beating him, he laughed and said

1070
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,500
You are the disciple of C15

1071
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,500
we're here for the shit

1072
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,500
come to get you

1073
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Just hit him with this

1074
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
as this bag

1075
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
nine people wake up

1076
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,000
Of course it hurts to be beaten

1077
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
wake up soon

1078
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,500
after waking up

1079
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,000
Those Angels are gone

1080
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Nine is Saint

1081
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
saint

1082
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,500
Catholic Fort the Saint

1083
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,500
translates to saint

1084
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,500
saint he feels pain all over

1085
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Maybe he also finds himself mixed

1086
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
there is that edge mark

1087
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,740
I fell out of bed wondering if he was sleeping

1088
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,340
OK

1089
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,340
anyway

1090
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,340
all in all

1091
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,540
the whole long time

1092
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,040
Only then did I realize that

1093
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,540
oh

1094
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,540
this translated bible

1095
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,540
I won't ask which kind of prettiest this one

1096
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,040
this problem

1097
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,840
style

1098
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
or style

1099
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,540
OK

1100
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,700
to translate

1101
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,540
OK

1102
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,840
Of course there is a reason for this

1103
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,640
OK

1104
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,380
Two appointments in the New Territories

1105
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,140
The interval of about 500 years in the middle

1106
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,640
What about the Old Testament era?

1107
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,880
Actually most people

1108
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,380
Don't say people like Jesus and others

1109
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,640
In fact, many people are shepherds.

1110
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,440
OK

1111
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,380
shepherd you expect him this one

1112
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,640
including the heretics

1113
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,380
OK

1114
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,580
How high do you expect him to be in this deal?

1115
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,740
Then they are here all day and night

1116
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,980
There's one that's sloppy, etc.

1117
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,760
OK Shepherd, boil water and grass but refuse

1118
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,000
OK, tell me how good this kind of education they can be

1119
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,800
I think this is a big problem

1120
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,000
OK so how to say

1121
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
uh this

1122
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So this is a date

1123
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Just ask everyone not to think of it as saying

1124
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Of course, it is a question as great as our Fourteenth Five-Year Classics.

1125
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
uh written stuff

1126
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Then it's quite, uh, how to say this?

1127
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The language of the book is quite reasonable.

1128
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
OK although I don't understand Hebrew

1129
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But to understand this uh

1130
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Just make an appointment, it is written in a language that is quite reasonable

1131
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
except for the whole

1132
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
middle two exceptions

1133
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
San Yongji and this

1134
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Uh, it's commonly known as locking our prince brother's

1135
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
OK

1136
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,280
part of this thing

1137
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,000
ok

1138
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,320
that is poetry

1139
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,240
that is poetry

1140
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,440
of course it's impossible

1141
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,240
Tata Tata

1142
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,640
too vulgar to write in this language

1143
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,300
The others

1144
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,440
this is recommended

1145
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,240
Wrong place to start

1146
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,240
actually follow

1147
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,640
not so

1148
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,160
That is to say, the style is

1149
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,640
are all comparisons

1150
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,400
lower level

1151
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,360
ok

1152
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,120
and you

1153
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,080
think about it

1154
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,080
when jesus was twelve

1155
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,360
just come out and follow one

1156
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,680
At that time, there was this teacher of the Tairen

1157
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,280
debate over there in the temple

1158
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:34,800
ok

1159
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,360
a twelve year old boy

1160
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,000
how smart is jesus

1161
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,160
Just think about a twelve year old kid

1162
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,680
we today

1163
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,000
Our twelve-year-old boy today

1164
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,040
you speak out

1165
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,360
what great words did you say

1166
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:47,920
ok

1167
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,160
jesus may be an exception

1168
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,240
He may speak of some of the greater

1169
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,600
these words come out

1170
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,640
But those of his contemporaries

1171
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,520
How can there be such a skill?

1172
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,680
so

1173
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,840
This part about this is actually quite reasonable.

1174
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,320
The so-called vulgarism

1175
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,040
ok this kind of question

1176
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,920
written ok

1177
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,120
It's hard to tell about the appointment

1178
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,320
What about the spirit of writing?

1179
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,760
varying levels of education

1180
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,960
ok, for example, the Gospel of Matthew, this Matthew

1181
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,160
Ma Dou La

1182
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,680
catholic horse beans

1183
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,120
ok horse bean gospel

1184
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,480
Ma Dou is a person with a very good education

1185
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,760
ok the Gospel of John that's another story

1186
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,960
john is a dreamer

1187
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,080
dreaming all day long

1188
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,280
one crashed

1189
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,680
ok and he's a crash

1190
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,800
So his text compares

1191
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,160
more vulgar

1192
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,080
ok, what about the letter collection

1193
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,080
Letters

1194
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,720
The biggest trick in the letter collection is Paul.

1195
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,000
ok paul

1196
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
ok paul this them

1197
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,000
Catholics don't teach Paul

1198
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,160
ok catholic another

1199
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
this lecture

1200
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
like the words of paul

1201
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Paul is a senior intellectual

1202
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
He was very well trained in monasticism

1203
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So Paul's epistles

1204
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
he wrote nine letters

1205
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Wrote nine letters to Canadians

1206
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
to the romans

1207
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
give where where where

1208
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
connecting the entire mediterranean

1209
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
all the way to australia

1210
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
nine cities

1211
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Christians

1212
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
string it together

1213
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
so actually

1214
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I should say so

1215
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
this catholic

1216
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Jesus didn't invent it

1217
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
not created by him

1218
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Jesus actually thought he was a

1219
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
How to say

1220
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
a prophet in Judaism

1221
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
This is his definition of who he is

1222
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
really take this catholic

1223
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,800
or to put the thought of jesus

1224
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,920
believers in jesus

1225
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,520
this person connected

1226
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,760
it's paul

1227
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,920
It was Paul's contribution

1228
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,360
So we often say that Paul is

1229
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,000
true founder of catholicism

1230
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,200
jesus is not

1231
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,960
OK

1232
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,760
then anyway what i want to say is to say

1233
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,560
paul he is actually a

1234
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,000
a man who is very well trained in rhetoric

1235
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,440
especially experienced

1236
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,840
The so-called judicial rhetoric

1237
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,560
OK

1238
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,440
This training in courtroom rhetoric

1239
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,240
in court like a lawyer

1240
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,160
able to talk to others

1241
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,280
debate with others

1242
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,000
OK

1243
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,840
He's been very well trained in this area

1244
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,080
So the Pauline letter is

1245
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,800
it is written

1246
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,800
How to say Wang Yang knowledge

1247
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,400
OK

1248
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,440
this one

1249
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,400
this kind

1250
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,800
this kind

1251
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,120
this reasoning

1252
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:57,720
OK

1253
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:58,560
debate

1254
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It's almost diabolical

1255
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,500
ok let you down

1256
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,500
make you feel say

1257
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Anyway, what you said seems to be the most correct.

1258
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,500
ok, so the wish is a bit more difficult to say

1259
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,500
It's different when you go to the Discrimination Register

1260
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,000
The discrimination record is actually made by the local one.

1261
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,500
this one this book

1262
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,000
Sorry, I have Tian Bishops here.

1263
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,500
I'm christian

1264
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,500
because i'm not a gangster

1265
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,000
I sometimes speak and compare

1266
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
From the point of view of our secular world

1267
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Discrimination record you all know

1268
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
The discriminatory record is only inside

1269
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
It's all a myth, isn't it?

1270
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
The issue of discrimination

1271
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
That style is quite low style

1272
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That is to say it is not very elegant style

1273
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
ok so wish it had this

1274
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
it doesn't have to

1275
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
it has elegance

1276
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Some are lower

1277
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
ok so this congratulatory belt

1278
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,560
He's pretty awesome

1279
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,380
When he met this Xinyue

1280
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,920
he will become a problem

1281
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,960
OK he will be a problem

1282
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,540
This is what we have been teaching students on the translation

1283
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,840
I am in the Institute of Translation Research

1284
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,900
Persevere OK

1285
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,220
Then I often teach students that

1286
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,560
You can translate consciousness

1287
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,400
It's just a basic job

1288
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,460
What you should really be doing is

1289
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,040
Translate people's questions

1290
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,080
Translate other people's style

1291
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,880
that's it

1292
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,940
To complete this job of this translation, let's say

1293
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:40,720
OK

1294
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,800
We have too much of this in foreign countries

1295
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:45,840
sinologist

1296
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,600
OK

1297
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,640
Whether Chinese or foreigners

1298
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,960
78 weeks after this was dug out

1299
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,800
After Du Fu was dug out again, there was no difference between Du Fu that week.

1300
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:55,800
OK

1301
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,800
What about us in Taiwan?

1302
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:59,340
same ok

1303
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,160
Then lose the round British 19th century romantic teacher

1304
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,160
Number kids19th century romantic teacher

1305
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,160
You learned this shirley from a 19th century romantic teacher

1306
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,960
After you translate it into Chinese

1307
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,760
Those three people are also a total of one person

1308
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,000
Turned out that the English style is gone

1309
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,920
You just pass the message out

1310
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,520
Then send this message

1311
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,600
problem didn't come out

1312
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,600
So how can you say your translation is a successful one?

1313
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,800
you turn to the end you will find

1314
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,000
if say you have some translators

1315
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,160
when he went on

1316
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,160
You find that what he translates is actually

1317
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,400
His translation of SARS Biya is quite anti-French

1318
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,240
That is to say, the first-class SARS Biya

1319
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,200
Follow him to read second-rate and third-rate Western writers

1320
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,200
The problem is the same style is the same

1321
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
this change

1322
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
it's a pity

1323
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
But it's hard to teach students

1324
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Let them fully understand this style

1325
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
how important

1326
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Naga Jinna is very clear

1327
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
this one person

1328
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
This dream that actually gave birth to Jerome

1329
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
this dream

1330
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
In fact, posterity later inspected this textual research

1331
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Jerome's dream

1332
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
actually sitting here

1333
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
he started this translation bible

1334
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
years ago

1335
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Ok

1336
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
So he actually translated the Bible with this

1337
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
it doesn't matter

1338
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
But in the end it will be our human ability

1339
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Ok

1340
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
this history of translation

1341
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Just take this Jerome's dream

1342
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Ok

1343
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Why use this with Jerome

1344
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
so-called general book

1345
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,800
Latin to translate the bible

1346
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,720
just combine it

1347
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,600
OK

1348
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,940
the useless one

1349
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,600
this bible

1350
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,400
This is called Homeless Big Ben

1351
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,360
this is chinese

1352
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,840
OK in English

1353
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,600
The Vulgate Bible

1354
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,400
OK

1355
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,540
The Latin word for English is called

1356
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,380
Knife

1357
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,080
OK

1358
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,440
this homeless man

1359
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,600
this bible

1360
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,560
where is the big homeless bible

1361
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,500
this

1362
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,900
no

1363
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,960
no

1364
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,860
this one

1365
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,860
how to say that

1366
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,360
similar

1367
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,360
similar to this one

1368
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:38,260
Plaintext

1369
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,060
OK

1370
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,160
Or

1371
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,760
similar

1372
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,860
don't speak plain language

1373
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,460
It doesn't even look like stereotyped essays

1374
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,260
OK

1375
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,060
it is totally used

1376
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:49,660
in the market

1377
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,960
those

1378
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,160
so-called peddling

1379
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,260
The so-called speculators who sell ginger

1380
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,160
OK

1381
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,660
It's the mother-in-law in the market

1382
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,060
them

1383
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
translate this bible in their words

1384
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
So five big bibles

1385
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The five big bibles are in the era of about

1386
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
around the fourth century

1387
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
this Yoshimaru

1388
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Tunnel fifth century

1389
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I don't know remember

1390
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Because after Yoshimaru

1391
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
until this

1392
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Probably around 1592

1393
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
In fact, the whole of Europe

1394
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
They all believe in the five major Bibles

1395
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Because this is the Church of Rome

1396
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
signed this bible

1397
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
you don't need to understand greek

1398
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
you don't need to understand spanish

1399
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but you have to understand

1400
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
you can read this bible in latin

1401
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
otherwise

1402
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
you don't understand latin

1403
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
You can at least pronounce that too

1404
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
So

1405
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,400
Translated five large Bibles

1406
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,000
is the translation of the Middle Ages throughout Europe

1407
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
until 1592

1408
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
At that time, it was called Kermit Barst

1409
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
he just thought

1410
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It seems that throughout the Middle Ages

1411
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:34,000
As long as Gutenberg invented printing in 1550

1412
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
before 1550

1413
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
In fact, what you read about Jiuwenteng

1414
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It's all this superbook

1415
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
It's all super on the central grape

1416
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Ultrabooks are a big problem

1417
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
some people more than one word

1418
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Some people have one more word and one less

1419
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
or not the whole

1420
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
gone, and so on

1421
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,400
how am i

1422
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,900
is there any such condition

1423
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,200
Can be long, conceivable situation

1424
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,400
In fact, most of them will have

1425
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,600
So in 1592 when

1426
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,000
This Climate 80

1427
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
He finally said no

1428
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,900
OK, this must be unified

1429
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,600
This one of the five big books

1430
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,800
How to say

1431
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,600
His ciphertext is not

1432
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,900
OK, so this one came out in 1592

1433
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,500
that latin family is called

1434
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:34,100
I Kadan Climateenum

1435
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,300
OK, the English translation is called

1436
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,300
Climate times

1437
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,700
vulgate

1438
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,500
OK, that is to say

1439
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,100
This is a Climate book

1440
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,100
Big Five

1441
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,100
Bible

1442
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,100
OK

1443
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,300
Then I can be 100% sure that

1444
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,300
He Qingpai

1445
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,500
translate the ancient bible

1446
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,500
must be based on

1447
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,560
With Gartham, Clementine

1448
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,600
but

1449
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,240
Even if it is this book, the so-called standard text, the Bible

1450
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,560
In fact, there are various Versions versions

1451
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,660
Some have gaps, some don't

1452
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,500
There is this one, with possible punctuation

1453
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,060
In fact, punctuation marks were rarely used at that time.

1454
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,880
this is late

1455
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,420
so

1456
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,340
in the end want

1457
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,740
If we do this today, then we do this today

1458
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,080
I already have 36 volumes of this

1459
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,620
this

1460
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,900
fruit new bible

1461
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,480
Then we're going to find this for the 36 volumes of the Guoxin Bible

1462
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,260
This is the first book

1463
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:43,780
ok

1464
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,600
It's not that easy

1465
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,360
ok

1466
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,700
Why is it not such an easy thing?

1467
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,260
actually

1468
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,820
The reason for this should be your replacement chief.

1469
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,580
ok

1470
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,660
The reason is this

1471
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,840
There are some libraries in the mainland

1472
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:04,600
OK

1473
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,140
Until now

1474
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,240
Probably not very willing to let you read his book.

1475
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,000
OK

1476
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,880
Whether it is He Jin, he has always lived in Beitang

1477
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,420
Bei Tang in Beijing

1478
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,740
Beitang is by the sea, that area, Peking University

1479
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,760
that area

1480
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,520
OK

1481
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,840
this North Tang

1482
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,160
Actually own a really good one

1483
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,980
The library is like our newer education before

1484
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,280
A pretty awesome library like

1485
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:34,560
Northern Tang Book

1486
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,100
Northern Tang's book dream

1487
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,140
actually exceeded

1488
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:42,240
Shumeng of Beitang, you let go of Shumeng of Beitang, there are quite a few of them

1489
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,320
The big price version of this

1490
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,360
Bible

1491
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,940
The Christian edition of this bible

1492
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,500
there are quite a few

1493
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,780
also super same

1494
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:56,060
even more

1495
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:56,820
OK

1496
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,320
Where is the dream in this book?

1497
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,840
clearly recorded

1498
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
but you have to take

1499
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
There just happens to be this very, very interesting coincidence

1500
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
i've been watching this

1501
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Previously this was a magazine published in Zhejiang

1502
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
It's called "Shangzi Compilation Library Journal"

1503
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
There is still a university in Japan called "Shangzi University", right?

1504
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Then this "Shangzi Compilation Library Journal"

1505
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It contains the special script for Northern Tibet

1506
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Then pointed out that Mrs. He Jin once had a heart attack

1507
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
This operation of the 15 cards of the magic guard

1508
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Of course, these operations will not be fun later

1509
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
When it's time for the tuition fee, it will take the class by the way.

1510
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So in fact, if we say that there is a way

1511
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Put this North Tibet by the way because those

1512
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
so much of this nerve

1513
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Let's match each other

1514
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
If the operation of these 15 cards

1515
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,120
if you are there

1516
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,000
So

1517
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,020
cooperate

1518
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,380
we all know

1519
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,540
Which book is He Jinjia based on

1520
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,320
this one

1521
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,020
Well

1522
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,620
clament version of this one

1523
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,380
Um

1524
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,600
The Five Great Ones

1525
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,400
OK

1526
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,060
Well

1527
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,140
But because

1528
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,060
Well

1529
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,060
Some

1530
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,340
Well

1531
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,160
some causes of noise some noise

1532
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,760
OK

1533
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,420
so

1534
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,220
You have to look for this bibliography in the Northern Collection

1535
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,380
He Jin’s all this specific version

1536
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:28,320
Well

1537
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,040
People in difficulty today from

1538
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:31,440
Well

1539
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,660
in ours

1540
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,220
Well

1541
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,620
Before Xu Jiahui in this continent

1542
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,680
Xu Jiahui didn't even know that he had a book called

1543
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,160
old and new biblical

1544
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:40,680
OK

1545
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,760
he has a herb

1546
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,040
called the Old New Bible

1547
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,280
Xu Jiahui doesn't know

1548
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,040
OK

1549
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:45,880
so uh

1550
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,760
How to say

1551
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:47,800
this book

1552
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,240
The basic problem is

1553
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,680
a quite

1554
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:51,600
big one question

1555
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,920
pretty good

1556
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,680
OK

1557
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
So

1558
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,000
Well

1559
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,280
You can still find out

1560
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,280
He Jinjia

1561
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,200
On some version issues related to the script

1562
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,540
This man is bold

1563
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:10,500
OK how to say

1564
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,800
He not only divides this creation into spirits

1565
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,400
and the spirit of creation

1566
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,000
A little bit more detailed on this preference

1567
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,500
He also has something different in this place

1568
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,800
OK, for example, Diamond King Jing is Liu Wang Ji

1569
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,300
OK Volume 10 has a total of 26 articles

1570
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,800
In fact, it is better than the Clementine version of the five elders themselves

1571
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,300
one extra

1572
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,900
His so-called bias is actually what we call dirty now

1573
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,600
One more OK

1574
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,000
That's because we built it because

1575
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
He Jin, there will be one shaya left

1576
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Chapter 38 of Leftover Essence

1577
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,200
Dirty beautician for this Hazakill

1578
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,600
He won it to the tenth volume of this diamond king

1579
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,300
dubbed into a drill

1580
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,100
drill articles

1581
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:29,900
OK, but He Jinhai, he can be honest, he will tell you, this poem, I got it here from this slow place, OK, this is what I think He Jinhai, I actually don't understand how this guy is so bold, he dared to cut your Bible, OK, he dared to cut your Bible, so even if you want to find this one with his,

1582
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:39,100
This Bible Zhang Jie, biased, biased, biased, is exactly the same as this Bible,

1583
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:56,600
I'm afraid, the first one is not easy, so what if you find the second one, OK, He Jinhai is actually very clear about why he wants to change these things, OK, so these are actually quite

1584
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,800
First of all, we are now waiting for sex,

1585
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,840
materials are limited

1586
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,680
Some koans in the biblical conference history

1587
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:08,440
so

1588
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,060
I see a lot of this bible to the end

1589
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:16,140
I now at least I now say this whole

1590
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:18,680
The last sentence

1591
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,780
This five-big bible in the Crano edition

1592
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,600
is to solve the first problem

1593
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:26,620
as of today

1594
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,420
largest common divisor

1595
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,180
OK

1596
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,780
This is about China National Investment Pavilion

1597
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,300
his this

1598
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,620
If he didn't open the last book

1599
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:38,920
Because all the books in Beijing are used later

1600
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,960
After 49 years, all rely on this

1601
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,520
This area of ​​China National Investment Pavilion

1602
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,800
he is not open

1603
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,080
OK like a baby

1604
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:46,840
OK

1605
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,920
we will always be

1606
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,000
This problem will never be solved

1607
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:53,760
OK

1608
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,300
itself is a public opinion

1609
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,620
So He Jinnai in a yes indeed

1610
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,340
There are some arrangements in the Bible

1611
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,840
yes there are some very very surprising

1612
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,940
surprise arrangement

1613
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:11,740
OK

1614
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,140
then the future

1615
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:19,640
What I pay more attention to is He Qingtai's language problem

1616
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,440
Because this is the first vernacular

1617
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,240
our nerves

1618
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,000
So when we get it, we must pay attention to

1619
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,140
vernacular these two words

1620
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,000
OK

1621
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,200
Then we say that we don't like the word

1622
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,040
it's a copy of this one

1623
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:35,700
The so-called Mandarin Bible

1624
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,700
People are because of He Qingtai

1625
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,300
the text he used

1626
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,000
actually quite

1627
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,400
you are familiar

1628
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,900
quite familiar

1629
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,100
you can say this

1630
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:48,800
OK

1631
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,400
and it has some

1632
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,500
Very

1633
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,900
very interesting special usage

1634
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,600
Here I first demonstrate that

1635
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Before He Shengtai

1636
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,840
also which catholic masters

1637
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,840
here's some translation of the bible

1638
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,340
This one is called

1639
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,840
Yuen Long Nok's One

1640
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,840
a missionary in spain

1641
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
in his 1636

1642
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,340
I wrote a book called Verses of the Bible

1643
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,340
but no

1644
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,340
Don't follow the subtitles

1645
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:18,840
OK

1646
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,340
this bible verse

1647
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,340
The national translation of the Bible is not here

1648
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,340
holy bible

1649
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:28,340
It's three pairs of the so-called

1650
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:30,340
bible study time

1651
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:33,340
This verse that everyone should read

1652
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:35,340
So the book of bible verses

1653
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:37,340
although very thick

1654
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:39,340
But

1655
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:41,340
it

1656
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,340
it only means probably

1657
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,340
fifty three

1658
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,340
About fifty-four weeks a year

1659
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,340
fifty three four weeks

1660
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:50,340
Fifty-Three Four Pasagis

1661
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,340
OK

1662
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,340
nothing more

1663
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,340
Then these Pasagis

1664
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:57,340
it will add some explanation

1665
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,340
this explanation

1666
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,340
Then it uses the word intuition

1667
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
But that explanation is still quite far

1668
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
OK

1669
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Yang Maruo translates this Holy Spirit Son's Day

1670
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
was in 1639

1671
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Before Yang Maruo

1672
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Actually Ai Weiwei translated this again

1673
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
The so-called incarnation of God is fierce in words and deeds

1674
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
This is a so-called gospel and technology

1675
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
In fact, this is the first book

1676
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
This first book is called

1677
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Wita Christi

1678
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
OK

1679
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Life of Christ

1680
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
OK

1681
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
holy son

1682
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
sorry for the harsh comment

1683
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
OK

1684
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Yang Maruo this

1685
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm sorry when Ai Weiwei translated

1686
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
this

1687
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
He said he dared not speak up

1688
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
OK

1689
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
because

1690
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
that book and this

1691
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
In this Holy Spirit he knew

1692
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
also lost this gospel

1693
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
OK

1694
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
because said album

1695
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
there is a little difference

1696
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So he said he dare not speak righteously

1697
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,000
In any case, he is still a text-to-text translator

1698
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,000
The time closest to He Jintai is Paris Foreign Mission Society

1699
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
A man named Bai Yusheng

1700
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
The book he translated is called "The Gospel of Facts as Unwilling"

1701
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:26,000
This so-called fact refers to the "Master's Blessings in Books"

1702
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
He deleted the repetition of "Fu Yu Shu"

1703
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Organize a non-overlapping turn of Jesus

1704
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
This is still Chinese

1705
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,000
only near too

1706
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
close too finally think

1707
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
according to him

1708
01:09:52,000 --> 01:10:00,000
He thinks I should learn English or not

1709
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,840
You shouldn't learn this sutra of love without meaning

1710
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,120
I have to be busy

1711
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,180
Because he landed from Macau

1712
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,740
What about after going ashore?

1713
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,780
started contacting this one

1714
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:13,300
Continue to learn the commissioner

1715
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:13,820
ok you

1716
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,160
In fact, the contact is the book

1717
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,760
For me, the above book is the one that should be changed to

1718
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,040
up in the sky

1719
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,060
ok

1720
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,100
That is to say

1721
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,360
It's a bible

1722
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,400
i don't understand him at all

1723
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,160
ok

1724
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,440
gave this annotation

1725
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,220
Sometimes I doubt it, just comment

1726
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,260
right?

1727
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,020
ok

1728
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:36,860
So writing a letter is certainly not that simple.

1729
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,140
a book

1730
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,460
The style of the book

1731
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,760
ok actually quite

1732
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,300
difficult

1733
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,060
ok

1734
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,100
then this

1735
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,120
this

1736
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,660
festival of sound

1737
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,220
Just use this to go to the book and go to the book

1738
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:54,780
Be your good Moz body

1739
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:56,320
to translate

1740
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:56,840
ok

1741
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,860
Learn from his book The Book of Voices to be honest

1742
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,540
I really doubt how many people can read it

1743
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:06,540
ok, that proves that there will be a problem involved

1744
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:10,700
Normal sound pronunciation, but rarely pay attention to say

1745
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,540
are you right or wrong

1746
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:17,340
ok, right or wrong, originally

1747
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,580
I should have been right

1748
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:23,340
ok, that's the right one

1749
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,980
ok, actually very

1750
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:29,320
A very off track concept

1751
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,680
ok, this is for

1752
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,600
In other words, this Chinese time translates the above Chinese time

1753
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,600
what should be timed with

1754
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,320
That's actually a very derailed question.

1755
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,560
Let me give you an example, because I don't understand

1756
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:46,560
I am not a bible expert

1757
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,320
I'm not, I don't understand Hebrew

1758
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:54,640
ok, my friend is Professor Li Zhichang from the Chinese University of Hong Kong

1759
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,960
I also invited him to this accountability office, this one to give a speech

1760
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,500
and play this river river

1761
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,240
OK

1762
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,740
He said this when He Heben opened

1763
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:11,380
Well, this god doesn't know how many days

1764
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,500
Created a head

1765
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,740
Because what we want to translate is called

1766
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,300
Sea Monster

1767
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,080
OK

1768
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,880
sea ​​monster

1769
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,180
A thing like this came out of this one

1770
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:23,680
right

1771
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,840
God didn't invent anything

1772
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,840
He'll say um, that's good

1773
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,500
OK

1774
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,800
You found out he said the monster came out and he also said um it's good

1775
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,500
OK

1776
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,500
Well

1777
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,800
did you react like that

1778
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,100
Just learned this everyone

1779
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,300
how to ask

1780
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,500
Do you just follow along?

1781
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,300
OK

1782
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:44,600
If you want to turn it according to

1783
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,200
I think the church will revolutionize

1784
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:46,800
OK

1785
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,800
uh no

1786
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,000
They don't dare to flip like that

1787
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,700
OK

1788
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,300
uh they use this uh

1789
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,200
how to say

1790
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,600
Uh, the tone is a bit more complete.

1791
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,000
Go get this Sea Monster

1792
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,500
The concept warms it up

1793
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,500
so that you don't feel so strong when you read it

1794
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,500
Holy land actually created a monster

1795
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:16,500
So this is the holy yin range

1796
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,500
In fact, the scope of Buddhism is almost the same

1797
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,500
often occur

1798
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,500
guru is guru in teaching

1799
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
not guru yu original text

1800
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Our general current concept is translation

1801
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
It should be Guru Yu's original text

1802
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
No way

1803
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
This word has never existed since

1804
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Until today, the combined practice book

1805
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
None of them are masters in the original text

1806
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
all masters

1807
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Including this big book

1808
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
while translating

1809
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Nine clouds in Jerusalem

1810
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
study at the university

1811
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
learn a western

1812
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
while in jerusalem

1813
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
bible

1814
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
OK

1815
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,400
St. Augustine

1816
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,700
Augustine

1817
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,500
OK

1818
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,600
Well in Rome this one

1819
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,500
As soon as I hear that he is translating this one, I will make an appointment.

1820
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,900
write a letter now

1821
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:14,400
This one went to Jerusalem and gave him

1822
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,300
what's in the letter

1823
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,000
The original text you are reading now

1824
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,300
If this subtogent of our faith

1825
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:22,700
OK

1826
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,700
This is the Greek word for

1827
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:26,300
OK

1828
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,300
if there is no bottom

1829
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,600
you can translate

1830
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,100
OK

1831
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,300
if there is a bottom

1832
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,200
please don't translate it

1833
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,700
OK

1834
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,200
you make this one wrong

1835
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:38,900
Let him be wrong until the end

1836
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,700
OK

1837
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,200
the bible is often like this

1838
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,900
because if you don't

1839
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,700
I'm really going to make this

1840
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,700
this this this

1841
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,300
education becomes this one

1842
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,500
there will be a minute hand

1843
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,100
OK

1844
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,000
if there is a minute hand

1845
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,300
That's what makes the church unrest

1846
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,200
In ancient times, the west was the orthodox education system

1847
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,300
church unrest

1848
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,100
will definitely affect

1849
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
to the issue of politics

1850
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
so this is a very big question

1851
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
So I often say this word stock since

1852
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Religious translation this support is

1853
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
The most should be to the original text should be the most

1854
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
The most faithful ok but

1855
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
no way ok is often the most unfaithful

1856
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
ok this this this

1857
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
how do you say this

1858
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
translate this

1859
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
the content of the problem

1860
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
but because of the content

1861
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Already framed by this teaching

1862
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
so generally

1863
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
translating this

1864
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
when the sound is actually

1865
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
What everyone pays attention to is

1866
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
what do i want to use

1867
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
style to translate the sound

1868
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
ok then some Augustine

1869
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
he wrote a book called

1870
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
on Christian doctrine ok

1871
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
because at this time

1872
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
he christianity has not yet appeared

1873
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
So I dare not translate him into tenure

1874
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I can only translate it as this Catholicism

1875
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It develops from Cicero's view the so-called free types of style

1876
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
This style divides it into three bodies

1877
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
There are so-called high-level questions

1878
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
There are so-called intermediate problems

1879
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
or intermediate questions

1880
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
There are also so-called low-level problems

1881
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
or the so-called flat problem

1882
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
These three styles do not actually represent

1883
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Which one is good or which one is bad

1884
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It only has the function above this function

1885
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
as i speak to you now

1886
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I can't this seems to be in

1887
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
The general is lecturing

1888
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
When asking troops to fight

1889
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I speak in a very, very high style

1890
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I can probably only use the kind of words that you can understand, which is more straightforward.

1891
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Let's talk about the old and the new Bible

1892
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So I actually use the third kind of problem

1893
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So I just accidentally ran out sometimes

1894
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
For example, draw something like this

1895
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
these three questions

1896
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
The bear tail problem is of course to move

1897
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
want one person

1898
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
The central problem is to make people feel like making up

1899
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
full of comfort and happiness

1900
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
the straight question or the low level question

1901
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
His purpose is to teach

1902
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
So most of us as teachers actually teach people

1903
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
It's all about quality

1904
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Although these three questions

1905
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Not that you are in the same article

1906
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Or in the same speech

1907
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You have always chosen a style to use

1908
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
you often know three

1909
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
will mix

1910
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
He Jinnai from 9M

1911
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
The concept of that dream is

1912
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
He has to use the third question to translate the bible

1913
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I'm hanging a new section here

1914
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Because the situation is a bit special

1915
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
a little exception

1916
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
He's bad for this little Marlowe

1917
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
My I56 uses 5A to apply

1918
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
parent number font

1919
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
use this

1920
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Use this variety show

1921
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
He Jinnai's emphasis on this article

1922
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
only say this bible

1923
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
What we should pay attention to is

1924
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
This truth in the Bible

1925
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,000
the word find or sentence

1926
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,760
In fact, God still has this blood spirit man

1927
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,260
Actually it doesn't matter

1928
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:06,160
OK, don't take it too seriously

1929
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:06,860
OK

1930
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,100
What is this Planes style

1931
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,960
What about quality issues?

1932
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,040
St. Augustine's definition is

1933
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,160
The statement is relatively peaceful

1934
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,560
more mature

1935
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,840
no such premature death

1936
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,760
He is closer to the masses

1937
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,500
So I said He Qingtai

1938
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:30,100
At least when he's translating in real vernacular

1939
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:32,660
He doesn't use Mandarin

1940
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:36,260
It is translating in Beijing dialect

1941
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,200
OK

1942
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,300
his translation is very

1943
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,660
Sometimes this, this, this, how to say

1944
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,000
After all, it is written exclusively for foreigners

1945
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,760
OK

1946
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,960
Often some of this writes

1947
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,400
there are some laws

1948
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,760
is to make ourselves very stimulating

1949
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,620
For example

1950
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,360
you translated that one word

1951
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,020
OK

1952
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:59,220
did i make a word

1953
01:19:59,220 --> 01:19:59,920
OK

1954
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,560
Then say the word war of this war

1955
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,660
His usage is the same as our current usage

1956
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:07,680
I'm afraid it's very different

1957
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:08,700
OK

1958
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,500
Feliz

1959
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,060
Feliz Dunn

1960
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,340
This Feliz Dunn

1961
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,360
Really come to fight

1962
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,380
OK

1963
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,480
About Abel and his parables come to fight

1964
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:21,240
Saiba

1965
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,260
OK

1966
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:25,860
I think there's a real battle here

1967
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,140
This battle is a

1968
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,960
Is a verb that does not care to explain in English

1969
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,520
OK

1970
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,840
Then let's fight Saiba

1971
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:37,160
And I used it as a verb, OK

1972
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:40,240
Actually we rarely use this one

1973
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:41,780
this

1974
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,600
Two usages of this actually we

1975
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:45,620
except dialect

1976
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,380
OK

1977
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,940
We rarely have this in Mandarin.

1978
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,060
Think of war as an OK that counts verbs but not verbs, we are

1979
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:55,340
fight

1980
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,100
right

1981
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,900
Fighting on both sides OK

1982
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
he doesn't talk like that

1983
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
he was in that era

1984
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
in the former home era

1985
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
he would say that

1986
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
St below

1987
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
yes

1988
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Sentifly

1989
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Colorful

1990
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
or Dediculate

1991
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
these two words

1992
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
he translates to

1993
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
holy

1994
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And you see a music added to the back

1995
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
In other words what is holy

1996
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
what word

1997
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
verb

1998
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
San Dang verb

1999
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
in Chinese

2000
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I

2001
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
in the knowledge of some

2002
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
almost never saw me

2003
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
saint can be a noun

2004
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
can make this a new word

2005
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But in our usage

2006
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
At least in the usage of Mandarin

2007
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It's not a proper verb

2008
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
But He Qingtai

2009
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
he takes him as a verb

2010
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
to use

2011
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
OK

2012
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,900
this is a very special place

2013
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:05,120
There are some words besides

2014
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,200
For example, if there are more than two characters, we call them words.

2015
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,000
OK

2016
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,540
Some of the applications used in ancient and modern times

2017
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:15,620
some of the more common words

2018
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:17,660
I put the Guina out for example

2019
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:19,960
the total one

2020
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,520
total of this word

2021
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,320
This word is our current way of speaking

2022
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,620
Mr. He's teaching is of common species

2023
01:22:26,620 --> 01:22:28,160
just heard

2024
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:29,180
OK

2025
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,480
I'm going to check Honglianmeng

2026
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,500
I just found out

2027
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,820
Mr. He did not make a mistake

2028
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,860
Red lotus dream is full of co-species

2029
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:37,620
OK

2030
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,680
So he did nothing wrong

2031
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,700
What about the snake?

2032
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,260
Snake is what we say in Taiwan now

2033
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,560
What about Hebei people?

2034
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,140
To this day, people in Hebei still hold a

2035
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,940
snake called snake

2036
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,500
Let's say again that I have an old minister from Hebei.

2037
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:55,040
maybe you will understand

2038
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:55,800
OK

2039
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,580
That

2040
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,360
help

2041
01:22:58,360 --> 01:22:59,900
they are quite

2042
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,260
OK quite

2043
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,780
Of course I also feel

2044
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:04,980
Are you so wrong

2045
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:05,720
OK

2046
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,560
So luckily there's a lot of this now

2047
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,920
Novel

2048
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,120
This one has electronic boards to search

2049
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,860
OK

2050
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,260
I look down

2051
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,540
Wow

2052
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,940
I have no knowledge myself

2053
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:19,520
not to come in without knowledge

2054
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,900
is quite right

2055
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:21,340
OK

2056
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,460
I'm pretty inside

2057
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,160
one year

2058
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,640
when you want to help

2059
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,720
it's almost

2060
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:29,420
Almost all of this uses the word quite

2061
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:31,860
There's this coolness in there

2062
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:34,380
This was originally from the book

2063
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:34,980
OK

2064
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,340
Kakindai

2065
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:37,260
it also uses

2066
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:37,860
OK

2067
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,660
Since it came out of the book

2068
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,860
Actually it doesn't necessarily mean

2069
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:44,020
This non-profit

2070
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:48,180
This Beijinger will only use this one

2071
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:52,780
I don't know if people in other places will use it

2072
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:53,500
OK

2073
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:57,060
Then this will actually be something we won't talk about.

2074
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:58,620
Then if this is taken as

2075
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,060
most people in the world

2076
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,400
It's back to the previous page.

2077
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,500
Tinnitus Heroes

2078
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,100
or Red European Dream

2079
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:08,700
The writing time of Hongoumeng

2080
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,500
In fact, it was the pre-agricultural era

2081
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,100
The biography of Wenkang's tinnitus heroes is more difficult to say

2082
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:18,400
Some people deduce him to these tariffs

2083
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:20,000
Someone said to go to Daoguang

2084
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,900
but no matter what

2085
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:24,300
Many scholars believe

2086
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:27,500
Tinnitus Heroes should represent

2087
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,900
Probably from Qiannong to Daoguang

2088
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,400
This is about a hundred years or so

2089
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,200
Beijing dialect in Beijing

2090
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:37,900
OK

2091
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:43,900
So I had to choose these novels

2092
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:48,400
To do well is a litmus test

2093
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,000
Check out this gold belt

2094
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,800
used some weird words

2095
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,900
is it right or wrong

2096
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,100
it made me realize

2097
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,000
he did use it

2098
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:11,840
OK, in other words, these words, in a sense, they should be some words commonly used by ordinary people in Beijing in this century

2099
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,980
OK, let's see the next one

2100
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:26,140
From this point of view, we can all say that when He Xingnai is translating, he prefers to use the so-called planning strategy.

2101
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,940
OK, this English is called domestication

2102
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:33,540
Planning means to follow the Chinese teaching method

2103
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:41,180
OK, but, sometimes this planning is really too planned

2104
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:49,880
OK, some people like their special panis, this pie

2105
01:25:49,880 --> 01:26:00,080
OK, IOR was in the birth of God, Yanqing fierce, in the early seventeenth century

2106
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:06,400
OK, he is taking this disease, this disease is a layer of disease

2107
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,000
The whole Panis is sick, because it is still called sick, right?

2108
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,600
OK, but what about He Jintai, he, super planned

2109
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,400
OK, he called it Mantou

2110
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:30,700
Ah, what about steamed buns? If you talk about this, he will continue to localize it.

2111
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,300
He just called him Bobo, OK

2112
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:39,400
So he has several kinds of this, this epidemic method, in fact, they are all similar to steamed buns

2113
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:46,600
OK, what about the ranan pancake that we now make?

2114
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,200
He simply put a layer of pancake, I don't know if pancake has words, OK

2115
01:26:51,200 --> 01:27:00,200
Then he was originally this, this, this, this, this, this so-called Cruce Do, this

2116
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
the word

2117
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,200
It means flat

2118
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,440
it is flat and thin

2119
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:08,440
I really don't know what a flat thin thing is

2120
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:11,340
Everyone should be more flat-faced steamed buns.

2121
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:14,840
so you're inside the last supper

2122
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:15,840
jesus said

2123
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,400
Jesus broke the cake

2124
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,900
Then give his picture say this

2125
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,100
This is my body

2126
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,100
this is my body

2127
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:26,400
What about this paragraph?

2128
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,100
He Jindai wrote it like this

2129
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,100
Jesus surrendered to this steamed bun

2130
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,100
Then what

2131
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,600
Divide the buns into pieces

2132
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,600
good at this his steamed bun

2133
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,100
OK

2134
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:39,600
where is jesus

2135
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,600
he himself

2136
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,600
Metaphor yourself as a business

2137
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,600
these two

2138
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,600
Doesn't he have Ling Wangtang?

2139
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,600
isn't it

2140
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,100
OK

2141
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,100
Gu Xin's voice

2142
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,100
Translate the words of Jesus

2143
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,100
I am a steamed bun of business

2144
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:54,100
OK

2145
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,600
i don't know this

2146
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,600
How did Beijingers sound at that time?

2147
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:00,600
but today we

2148
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Woke up today feeling weird

2149
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
that's even weirder

2150
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
this hunting king

2151
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
on this one

2152
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
originally a word called

2153
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
charcoal baked pancakes

2154
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
OK

2155
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
He Tiannai in his kings gold

2156
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Hunting King Ji, his name is Zhongwangjin

2157
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It is said to be a steamed bun of a living dragon and mouse

2158
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I can't cook though

2159
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,000
can't cook

2160
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
But I know that steamed buns are steamed

2161
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
He said steamed buns belong to mice

2162
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
We also know that this duck's he went

2163
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
he has many of these

2164
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
This kind of over-planning

2165
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,000
this sentence

2166
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
find it very interesting

2167
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Let's look at the next page

2168
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
OK

2169
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Another place to plan is

2170
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
this

2171
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
He Tiannai said that Tiandao

2172
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,000
The physics museum in this origin

2173
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
go paint

2174
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
OK

2175
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
in other words

2176
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,200
Qing Palace

2177
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,200
he actually

2178
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,200
not angry

2179
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,200
he is not good

2180
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,200
The language of the Qing court

2181
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,200
he is very familiar

2182
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:11,200
So inside the ancient and modern holy palace

2183
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,200
There is a Thai

2184
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,200
or the dynasty of the egyptians

2185
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,200
also often think

2186
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,200
some in here

2187
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:21,200
Up and down relationship

2188
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,200
so

2189
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,200
a Guo Wang

2190
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,200
or within a family

2191
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,200
richer family

2192
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,200
you see this one

2193
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:32,200
He Jin people will put the family

2194
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,200
this special character

2195
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,200
called master

2196
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,200
Those who do things for him are called slaves

2197
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:38,200
OK

2198
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Then what

2199
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,200
master of course

2200
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,200
Of course the slave must follow the master

2201
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,200
This is commonly known as auspicious

2202
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,200
OK

2203
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,200
I have to say hello to him too

2204
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,200
OK

2205
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
so these words

2206
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,200
you can see that

2207
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,200
that is

2208
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,200
He Jin gave birth to a new year's home

2209
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,200
Then his place is indeed

2210
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,200
also received a public year

2211
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Can't keep up with the impact

2212
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Not only this effect

2213
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
There is also the following effect

2214
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
we can take a look

2215
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
not a good question

2216
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
there is another

2217
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
not this

2218
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
no and not this

2219
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Just wait until you can't find it

2220
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
we now find

2221
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
let me talk

2222
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
ok

2223
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
anyway

2224
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
his

2225
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
his translation strategy

2226
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
basically

2227
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
if he can internalize

2228
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
or planning

2229
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
he can plan

2230
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What I was actually looking for was a

2231
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
so-called prison

2232
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
we just know

2233
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Our green stuff, this growth pack

2234
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
see too much

2235
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
we know what this is

2236
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
what diameter

2237
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Circle diameter is a term that is often heard

2238
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
In fact, circle diameter is a character of Qingcha

2239
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,640
There are also various ways of the circle diameter

2240
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:05,640
ok

2241
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:07,640
if it is

2242
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,000
There is a circle of people

2243
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
ok

2244
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,560
Foretell this and employ this

2245
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,160
you can go no problem

2246
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:17,800
a little house arrest

2247
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,120
next to you is a lot of water

2248
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:20,800
stand over there

2249
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,520
But this line is to monitor you

2250
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:23,200
ok

2251
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,720
this circle of people

2252
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,520
ok

2253
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,520
Then there is also this, use strong and low to get angry

2254
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:29,960
you ride in it

2255
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,320
you are not allowed to run around

2256
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,040
ok

2257
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:33,960
some are locked in matter

2258
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:34,920
you can't run around

2259
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,960
General Su Liyuan seems to be

2260
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,800
experienced these things

2261
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,000
so what

2262
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,680
From this Chinese form, he

2263
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,680
he created himself

2264
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,120
egyptians in

2265
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:46,560
sorry

2266
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,440
some people in egypt this

2267
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:50,200
quilt

2268
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:50,840
what

2269
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,760
means being forced to do something

2270
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,880
when writing some projects

2271
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:58,320
He invented this engineering circle

2272
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,120
ok

2273
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,000
that pair of gold

2274
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,760
prison circle

2275
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,160
He is buying now

2276
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,580
OK came across these in China

2277
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:08,700
this lecture

2278
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:10,680
Just translate it like this

2279
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,200
OK

2280
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,340
Well

2281
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,080
How to say

2282
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:13,880
Well

2283
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,320
Although this is a

2284
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,840
this one

2285
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,880
Well

2286
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,480
Um

2287
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:19,480
Compare

2288
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,240
close to this China

2289
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,080
A kind of

2290
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:24,200
translation method

2291
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,520
However, this translation method is already a language

2292
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,360
Well

2293
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,960
It's not just translating this language anymore.

2294
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,400
He is also translating culture

2295
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:34,120
OK

2296
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,000
Well

2297
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,880
so i say

2298
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:37,120
in here

2299
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:37,960
Well

2300
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,840
cusine bible this one

2301
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,840
this

2302
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,400
when he is thinking

2303
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,160
He Jinnai is thinking about this one

2304
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,120
how to translate when

2305
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,120
in fact already

2306
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,360
total

2307
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,920
already already

2308
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,600
is doing a

2309
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,200
Well

2310
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,760
this one of culture

2311
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,800
Transferred this question

2312
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,600
OK

2313
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,960
what about this question

2314
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,520
If this cultural transfer across state lines

2315
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,080
Actually

2316
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,840
is what we call modernity today

2317
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,880
this ring

2318
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:06,660
OK

2319
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:09,720
I dare not say this ancient and modern scripture

2320
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:13,560
How closely related to what we call modernity

2321
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,400
But at least I invented a term called

2322
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:18,440
dad called

2323
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,460
bottom

2324
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:22,020
Chen Feng's modernity in what he often said

2325
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:23,560
i think it should be ok

2326
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:24,320
OK

2327
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,620
I haven't written anything yet

2328
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,400
I spoke

2329
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:32,000
We have probably already talked about this bandon

2330
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,560
i think i keep talking

2331
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,100
because it's almost time

2332
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,420
I have been talking about a He Jintai

2333
01:33:38,420 --> 01:33:40,960
This ancient and modern scripture

2334
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:43,520
I once did a study

2335
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,840
is one this one clear one

2336
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,140
Missionaries called Marlowe

2337
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:50,180
a novel he wrote

2338
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:50,960
OK

2339
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,780
He based this on Cicero's

2340
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:55,040
The Republic

2341
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:55,820
OK

2342
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:58,120
That Skipio on the last side

2343
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
His housewife took him to heaven

2344
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Then look around the universe from the sky and see the earth

2345
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:16,000
An imagination of Cicero like this

2346
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:22,000
This vision of Joseph Marosell visiting Cicero

2347
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
wrote a novel

2348
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I haven't read this novel.

2349
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I only see superbooks

2350
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
i have a day

2351
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
once i wrote an article

2352
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
when reading at a meeting

2353
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
someone asked me

2354
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:46,000
What's the point of your research on superbooks

2355
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
This means that

2356
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Superbook is just a person

2357
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
copy a book

2358
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,000
It does not mean that the book had a great influence

2359
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,640
What is the point of your research on this ultrabook?

2360
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,340
OK

2361
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:08,600
I know your key is the so-called influence

2362
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,800
this question

2363
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,840
That Marlowe is another question

2364
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,040
actually

2365
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,800
That question is a big one

2366
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,240
OK Maloser affected financial love

2367
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,000
OK

2368
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,600
Superbook not engraved things

2369
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,840
For later Maloser was a Catholic missionary

2370
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,000
But what?

2371
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,140
But this one he wrote

2372
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:28,800
This one is not engraved

2373
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
dream no soil skills

2374
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It's a dream of heaven, a dream of heaven

2375
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:32,700
OK

2376
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:35,800
Meng did not have soil skills, but it affected the later Protestantism

2377
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,000
Guo Shili

2378
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:37,900
OK

2379
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,700
let's say this one

2380
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,000
this one milian

2381
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,500
some of their missionary novels

2382
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:44,700
OK

2383
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,100
that's full

2384
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,200
a terrible thing

2385
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,500
OK

2386
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,200
What about He Qingtai?

2387
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:55,100
He Qingtai This Old and New Bible

2388
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:55,900
same

2389
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,100
he is still

2390
01:35:57,200 --> 01:35:59,400
The first trainer is not allowed to take a tick

2391
01:35:59,400 --> 01:35:59,900
he does not

2392
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,280
Don't mess around

2393
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,040
ok

2394
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,860
The coach doesn't allow Kona to count.

2395
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:05,640
ok

2396
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,160
The coach is not allowed

2397
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,720
The coach has nothing to show others

2398
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,500
ok

2399
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:14,080
So around the year 181,000

2400
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,920
Just a little bit more relaxed Catholicism

2401
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,240
catholic or catholic room

2402
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,020
ok

2403
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,300
just take this

2404
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:26,620
He Jintai's ancient nerve

2405
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:29,440
The part of the welfare book inside.

2406
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,980
ok

2407
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:32,500
take it to guangzhou

2408
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:34,300
ok

2409
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:35,580
show this one

2410
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:38,900
The first Protestant missionary to China

2411
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,700
Robert Morrison

2412
01:36:40,700 --> 01:36:41,740
ok Morrison

2413
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,780
So Morrison was

2414
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:44,800
read this one

2415
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,300
Well

2416
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:46,340
this one

2417
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:47,620
archaic nerve

2418
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:48,900
at least he read

2419
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,700
welfare book ok

2420
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:52,480
but i feel like

2421
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,020
I'm afraid it's not just the welfare book

2422
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,820
Morrison's category of reading

2423
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:57,860
I'm afraid it's pretty big ok

2424
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:08,000
A bible later said to be the first master translation in China

2425
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
so-called holy book

2426
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
In fact, a large part of it was influenced by He Jingtai

2427
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
If you have read the sacred book

2428
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
The holy book is really read

2429
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,000
You will feel that the whole O mouth has reached the extreme

2430
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
That kind of O mouth is actually related to He Jingtai

2431
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I think I learned it from He Jingtai

2432
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Yihe Jingtai's wish is indeed not as plain as its old counterparts

2433
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
The old dissimilarity is vernacular

2434
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
First, because of the various divine and holy books I just mentioned

2435
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Their education level is related

2436
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So there are various problems that manifest

2437
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
where to choose from time to time

2438
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Just to learn the kind of words that are more awkward

2439
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
so where to choose this one

2440
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Well...

2441
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
The god has lost

2442
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
uh... or so-called psychological lost

2443
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
The rescue was lost, etc.

2444
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
uh...actually

2445
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
uh...been through this one

2446
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
and mentality of this one influence

2447
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
even with charitable intentions

2448
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
he's been affected

2449
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
It means that we are actually

2450
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
We actually have two postures in Paradise today

2451
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
catchy

2452
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
When I was a child there was another called

2453
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Cigarettes of Heart Paradise

2454
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
But it's not easy for everyone to see

2455
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Uh... if you have this mentality

2456
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Must be... antique

2457
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
must be very valuable

2458
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
then...we...

2459
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
What about the two poses of Paradise?

2460
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
not from china

2461
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Only Buddhism can use it

2462
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
The two poses of Paradise

2463
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Is there a paradise in China

2464
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
if you look for it in the world

2465
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
That's Leto

2466
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Tu Yang's picture

2467
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Letu

2468
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
inside to get involved

2469
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I don't know

2470
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,900
But he is indeed the whole of Christianity

2471
01:39:02,900 --> 01:39:08,100
That is to say, including Catholicism and Protestantism

2472
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,140
Christianity

2473
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:09,840
OK

2474
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,040
the whole of christianity

2475
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,200
Maybe there is a Nestorian in it

2476
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:13,900
OK

2477
01:39:13,900 --> 01:39:15,140
First

2478
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:16,040
this says

2479
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,300
Said that now I want to live in Paradise

2480
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:20,900
this place

2481
01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:22,040
he is the first

2482
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:22,940
OK

2483
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:27,840
Later, the name has been handed down like this.

2484
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,440
OK

2485
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:31,780
Inside Mirror is in when writing his Huayun dictionary

2486
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:33,780
He also got up with him

2487
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:37,080
Puridice is also translated as this paradise

2488
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,080
Clean it up

2489
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,580
Puridiso is

2490
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:40,580
Puridion

2491
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,180
OK

2492
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:45,580
The word "paradise" is true

2493
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:46,880
Yang Tianyu's earliest time

2494
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,680
In fact, he dare not translate

2495
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:49,580
OK

2496
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:52,780
he called it this

2497
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:54,380
Yang Tianyu ran to

2498
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:56,680
go down

2499
01:39:58,580 --> 01:39:59,680
Um

2500
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,180
maximum

2501
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
You don't need to find it, it's okay

2502
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
anyway, yang tingting is paradise

2503
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
paradise, paradise

2504
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
ok , he uses this

2505
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Bala Tisha or something

2506
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
transliteration

2507
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Because he believes that in Chinese culture

2508
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Not Christianity, Catholicism

2509
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
this concept of this paradise

2510
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
So, the transliteration transliterated

2511
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
ok, transliterated

2512
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
The later Catholicism is the knowledge of Paradise

2513
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
There are many ways to say this

2514
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
ok because later on for example

2515
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
In this deep area of ​​calm

2516
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
In fact, Paradise is divided into

2517
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
heavenly paradise with

2518
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
earthly paradise

2519
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And City Paradise

2520
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Paradise on earth is of course biting the present

2521
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Yidian Park

2522
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Paradise

2523
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
That's the place for the Shangdi Group.

2524
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
ok then they

2525
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:59,000
It is derived from this book in China

2526
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,240
For example, the saying of heaven

2527
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:06,040
OK

2528
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:06,840
So

2529
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,200
It's all this paradise on earth

2530
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:11,360
this trouble

2531
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,200
Yang Tianyu called him

2532
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,480
sorry heaven paradise he still calls him

2533
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:17,320
Araiso

2534
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,480
Araiso

2535
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,160
OK

2536
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:23,360
earliest time

2537
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:28,040
Luo Mingjian fought with Lima when they were in the 1580s

2538
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,600
Bring Paradise

2539
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Paradise on earth

2540
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:32,680
OK

2541
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,400
this

2542
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,960
Pavaiso

2543
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:37,000
Terry

2544
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:37,400
OK

2545
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:39,040
he moved him into

2546
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,640
buddhist country

2547
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,440
OK

2548
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:44,520
Buddha

2549
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,480
Buddha's country

2550
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,400
OK

2551
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:48,800
I tell you

2552
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,920
This is because your first time

2553
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,280
cultural first encounter

2554
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,440
when this is a new noun

2555
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,480
You do have so many

2556
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:57,640
so big

2557
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:59,240
this

2558
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,080
that kind of words

2559
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,400
the kind of struggle above

2560
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,800
how to translate

2561
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:06,840
You're really pretty good at finding out

2562
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,400
an appropriate translation

2563
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,600
Naga Jinna is great

2564
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:17,600
He calls a certain language a paradise

2565
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,320
Paradise down

2566
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:23,320
Well, Xinjiao also went down with Paradise.

2567
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:24,600
Old teaching needless to say

2568
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,160
Plaster of the Old Church itself has been

2569
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,000
must be paradise

2570
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,400
Heart Teaching from Morrison

2571
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:33,960
From Morrison to this Guslev

2572
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,840
It is the so-called national stone power statement

2573
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:39,640
wait these people are paradise

2574
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:42,000
Paradise to our heart Paradise

2575
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,080
still in Paradise

2576
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:49,400
So if you want to look at it from the words

2577
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:52,400
this ancient and modern bible

2578
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,640
marison may not have read it from cover to cover

2579
01:42:55,640 --> 01:43:00,040
But also affected to some extent

2580
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,760
This can be seen

2581
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:05,720
I don't have that much time

2582
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:10,200
Or one of my two essences is looking at each other

2583
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:14,360
I think it should be possible to say something more interesting

2584
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,240
OK

2585
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:19,720
Then let me talk about style at the end

2586
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,280
This style is OK

2587
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:30,040
There is a very important scholar in the West

2588
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,280
Called Erik Albach

2589
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,280
He said

2590
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:39,280
The more vulgar language in it

2591
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,720
more vulgar language

2592
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:43,560
to write

2593
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:46,120
doesn't mean you can't

2594
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:49,480
In this rather vulgar concept

2595
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,720
in this language to create some kind of

2596
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,720
sublime

2597
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:55,280
OK

2598
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,080
A feeling like spinning tail

2599
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,720
Spin Tail is a Westerner

2600
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,120
the most beautiful

2601
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
extreme word

2602
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
OK

2603
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Well

2604
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I'll be full of an explanation chest

2605
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,000
words to explain

2606
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
i need this

2607
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
another hour

2608
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
OK

2609
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Well

2610
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:12,000
i can only say

2611
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,000
From the two examples I quote below

2612
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
OK

2613
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
is using a very simple

2614
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
This one is written in Chinese and this one

2615
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
OK

2616
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
But what?

2617
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
here you read

2618
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
especially if you have to follow

2619
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,000
If there are words above and below

2620
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,000
you read

2621
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Your feeling is the feeling of chest and stomach

2622
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,000
OK

2623
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Well

2624
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,000
first example

2625
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
This is the third entry from Chinese

2626
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Well

2627
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
inside this

2628
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
this came out

2629
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,000
talking about

2630
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Well

2631
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Alias' question

2632
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
OK

2633
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Well

2634
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
at that time this

2635
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
this god this

2636
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Hear the prophet Alias

2637
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
this one is a bit

2638
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
when feeling discouraged

2639
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
god this one

2640
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
he out

2641
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
he is coming

2642
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,000
he appeared

2643
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
OK

2644
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,000
in the bible

2645
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Well

2646
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
sorry

2647
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:09,400
This He Jin Dali medical method is a burst of landslides and seas after the appearance of God

2648
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,680
strong wind and rain

2649
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,560
Then God is not in the wind

2650
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:17,200
After this storm

2651
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:19,640
It's the same as our list

2652
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:21,000
That's right

2653
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,440
God is not in this cave

2654
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,160
but then fire

2655
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,440
God is still not in this fire

2656
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,440
I added a word for him

2657
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:34,320
the day after the fire

2658
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,600
Correction

2659
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,840
sound of gentle wind

2660
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,880
there is not a word in it

2661
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:43,280
this is the kind

2662
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,080
the kind in the article

2663
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:49,000
Very high injury point Ya sooner or later

2664
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,400
But the feeling of God you read

2665
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,720
is a rather sublime feeling

2666
01:45:55,720 --> 01:45:56,720
very serious

2667
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,960
very dangerous sense of god

2668
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
OK, so the following example is

2669
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:07,000
It's Epsalom, which is very famous for this

2670
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
this son of david

2671
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Because he felt that this David would not pass the throne to him

2672
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
So he rebelled

2673
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Rebellion wins and loses

2674
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
When I lost, I was chased by David

2675
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
run after

2676
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Then Epsalom at the end

2677
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Epsalom rides this lol all by himself

2678
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
OK, he suddenly met David's soldier

2679
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Then this Luo Zi passed through Qiu Yi

2680
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,000
under the tree

2681
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:50,000
His hair got caught by a tree... a branch

2682
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
The one who rides Luozi is wrong

2683
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
OK, I'll pin it up and run ahead

2684
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Then, He Junnai translated a sentence

2685
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,160
In fact, this text is not so clever

2686
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,820
but read it

2687
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:06,640
The Epsilon

2688
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,940
that imagery becomes very large

2689
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,260
he said his body

2690
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:13,700
hanging between heaven and earth

2691
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:14,700
ok

2692
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:18,260
While reading this I suddenly remembered this

2693
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,380
such a legal

2694
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,240
translation is a kind of interpretation

2695
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,740
ok such a legal

2696
01:47:24,740 --> 01:47:28,780
In fact, the unfilial son of Epsilon has been

2697
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:32,200
translate it as if that

2698
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,520
how to say

2699
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:36,240
You don't bow your head like God

2700
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,600
There is no such thing as Shadan

2701
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:39,600
ok

2702
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:44,120
The imagery is very, very mammoth

2703
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:44,620
ok

2704
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:46,900
Then we see that there is nothing great in it

2705
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:48,560
this one word this one appears

2706
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,560
so

2707
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,900
this Obach

2708
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:54,120
he will say ok

2709
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,340
even if

2710
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:57,340
belong

2711
01:47:57,340 --> 01:47:59,340
Nic on the third level question

2712
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:00,340
ok

2713
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,160
You can actually create the feeling of the first episode too

2714
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:06,200
It's Xuan Wei's feeling

2715
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:08,000
I give myself these two examples

2716
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,840
I don't think I will mention the others

2717
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,640
Finally, I will report to you again

2718
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:15,240
I have just reported Protestantism

2719
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:20,640
Protestantism influenced by the Old and New Bibles

2720
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:27,200
Old teaching bibles until the 1960s one night

2721
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:32,200
Although they already cared about it in pre-Canadian times

2722
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:36,400
But after this ban and so on

2723
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,600
They have to be ordered by the Pope to translate

2724
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:47,400
So the old school did not finish the translation until the 1960s

2725
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:52,720
Everyone has followed the translated old teaching

2726
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:57,000
This Chinese version we call Shi Gaoben

2727
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
The author of the Poetry Gaoben is a

2728
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,740
a french italian

2729
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:06,640
I'm sorry, the priest of the Italian Accounting Society is called Lei Yongming

2730
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:07,440
OK

2731
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,700
Father Lei Yongming

2732
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:09,940
italian

2733
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,480
Father Lei Yongming

2734
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:16,000
When he decided to start translating the bible for employment

2735
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,540
sorry when the whole bible

2736
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:23,480
He is very good with a camera

2737
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:25,440
a friend

2738
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,480
OK

2739
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:27,580
camera at that time

2740
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:29,740
Probably a huge camera

2741
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,640
he ran to

2742
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:36,240
Not long after the end of the Anti-Japanese War

2743
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,640
He ran to Beitang in Beijing

2744
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:39,440
OK

2745
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,780
What are you doing in Beitang?

2746
01:49:41,780 --> 01:49:46,180
He took He Qingtai's manuscript

2747
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:48,040
take it all out

2748
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:51,680
it took a whole month

2749
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:53,740
they used their

2750
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:57,940
It must be a very bulky camera

2751
01:49:57,940 --> 01:50:00,080
Kacha Kacha cards one by one

2752
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Finally shoot it

2753
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
And bite it to this side

2754
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
This ding on one side

2755
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Ding Thirty Sides

2756
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Then Liu Yongming put the thirty side

2757
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
take him to live longer

2758
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,000
That is to say, go inside his church

2759
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
because he wants to translate nerve

2760
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
nerves he can drink in for reference

2761
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
so if you read

2762
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
You read the words of this ancient and modern nerve that you drink in

2763
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
You will find that the world knows each other

2764
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Because Liu Yongming has too many nouns

2765
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:42,000
They are all citing this ancient and modern nerve of drinking Qingtai

2766
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,000
So this nerve that has not been officially published

2767
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
it's not without impact

2768
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
it has a lot of influence

2769
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Both the Heart Teaching and the Old Teaching both influence

2770
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
For those of us who are generally non-religious

2771
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,160
We also often hang some, such as saints

2772
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:06,960
These names, the names on these religions

2773
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,160
etc

2774
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:09,840
I still want to tell you

2775
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,680
What about these nouns?

2776
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:13,400
OK

2777
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:15,920
Then because of this one of the old and new religions

2778
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,240
especially Protestant

2779
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,880
Uh, use the past

2780
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,960
OK and then it becomes as if

2781
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:22,200
S-A-I-N-T

2782
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:23,040
Sent

2783
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,280
as if it becomes

2784
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:26,000
uh bible uh sorry

2785
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,120
There is a fixed one in the dictionary

2786
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:30,960
One way to explain it is

2787
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,240
S-A-I-N-T

2788
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:33,000
saint

2789
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,280
OK it becomes like this

2790
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:35,200
OK

2791
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,080
uh i spend a lot of time

2792
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,120
uh 150

2793
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:39,840
This one of 1.5 million words

2794
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,800
uh this one this one

2795
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:43,680
Such a big book OK

2796
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:45,720
uh i see

2797
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:47,320
uh gave this one for 150 days

2798
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,760
Maybe I'm just talking about this one

2799
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,160
able to speak

2800
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,120
be clearer

2801
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:52,400
OK so today

2802
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:53,760
uh actually

2803
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,040
obviously keep one

2804
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,920
uh talk a little bit

2805
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,880
I just hope this one is right

2806
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,840
everybody this one

2807
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Whether it is language history or

2808
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
OK Shenjing translation is also good

2809
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
OK even linguistics

2810
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
OK

2811
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Let alone this comparative literature

2812
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Or in terms of teaching

2813
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
The contribution of this book is actually quite large.

2814
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
It is very worthwhile for us to study

2815
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
ok thank you all

2816
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Thanks

2817
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Thank you Professor Li Shixue

2818
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
we'll take ten minutes

2819
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
So there are probably only three or four questions

2820
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
keep it short please

2821
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Thank you Professor Li for your wonderful speech

2822
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
what i want to ask is

2823
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
a little bit of me

2824
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Of course I understand the content

2825
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
i have a doubt

2826
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
That is to say, he was in Beijing

2827
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I believe he should be able to see

2828
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
For the first time, most people can't read

2829
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
The second time I'm sure he'll notice too

2830
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
In fact, the life of ordinary people

2831
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Although the Forty-Five Classics are written in classical Chinese

2832
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
but everyone will

2833
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
can also read and sing

2834
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
even

2835
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Another one is to say

2836
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Even if you are a small person with four classics

2837
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
at formal gatherings

2838
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Classical Chinese is often used

2839
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,400
Then he observed these conditions

2840
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:03,900
why did you decide to say

2841
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,960
He must use such straightforward language

2842
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,520
come and translate his bible

2843
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:08,860
did he respond to this

2844
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:10,900
He may have observed classical Chinese in

2845
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:12,860
comment on the prevailing situation in Chinese society

2846
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:13,560
this first

2847
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,660
then again that is to say

2848
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:16,960
Did he see some

2849
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,100
Chinese vernacular

2850
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:20,960
vernacular-like text

2851
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,760
pretty passable

2852
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:23,600
Quite able to call people

2853
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:26,200
That's why he translated his bible like this

2854
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,260
Thanks

2855
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:29,060
Thank you

2856
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:31,060
this is a very good question

2857
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:32,820
let me this take me just this

2858
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:34,520
In fact, what should be said is

2859
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:35,560
guest in this world

2860
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:37,220
I really can't speak

2861
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:39,360
In fact, we have always had an idea

2862
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,960
thought that this jesus would

2863
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:43,720
came to China

2864
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:46,460
Only learning this classical Chinese can lead to upward development

2865
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:47,320
That is to say

2866
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:49,860
In the past, the development of the husband class was preached

2867
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:50,820
OK

2868
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:51,920
That

2869
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:54,320
it's a big one

2870
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,260
at least in percent of this

2871
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:58,220
forty to fifty percent above

2872
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:59,480
This is a mistake

2873
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:00,080
OK

2874
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,760
The Jesuits certainly wrote a lot of literary books

2875
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:08,420
But throughout the Jesuit tradition

2876
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:10,680
There are also many books written in vernacular

2877
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:12,120
also a lot

2878
01:54:12,120 --> 01:54:14,780
And there are many of these books

2879
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:16,940
Because of the understanding of the Chinese

2880
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:19,020
It's actually beautifully written

2881
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:24,900
Vernacular Novels of the Ming and Qing Dynasties

2882
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,940
is avoidable

2883
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,540
I think He Jinnai

2884
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:33,340
The first one, of course he was influenced by luck

2885
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:36,500
The second one I can't quite agree with.

2886
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:39,060
What you just said was in the pre-Canadian era

2887
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:45,320
Classical Chinese seems to be a dominant language

2888
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:47,500
a bully language

2889
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:50,020
what i was actually trying to say was

2890
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:53,740
I think that in the general middle and lower society of the pre-Canadian era

2891
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:56,460
The real language of power is vernacular

2892
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,980
OK is vernacular

2893
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:59,740
I can't only

2894
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,840
I don't mean this vernacular novel

2895
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,000
this kind of popular fiction and stuff like that

2896
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I mean, let's say

2897
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
The Victory News

2898
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
OK, Shengli Guangxun

2899
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Well, Shengli Guangxun, to be honest, this

2900
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
The original, the original thing

2901
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
If you haven't passed by Wang Youpu

2902
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Wang Youpu is a disciple of this Fangbao

2903
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,000
OK, without Wang Youpu

2904
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
He rewrote it into vernacular

2905
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
OK, there is another person

2906
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
There are two very popular books in total

2907
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
This one of Shengli Guangxun, they are called Guangxun Xie

2908
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
explain it, ok

2909
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It's all vernacular, OK

2910
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
The vernacular writing is also really good, OK

2911
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Without these, without these two vernacular texts

2912
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
That's especially Guangxunjie

2913
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:51,000
It's Wang Youpu's book, OK

2914
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I doubt this victory

2915
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
this victory, ok

2916
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
this victory, he

2917
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,860
To what extent can it penetrate into the hearts of the people?

2918
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:04,860
The in-depth broadcast is

2919
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:07,860
Make this Morison very

2920
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:09,860
Influence Morison

2921
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:10,860
deeply affected

2922
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:12,860
Morison would love to say

2923
01:56:12,860 --> 01:56:17,360
I will use this text from Guangxun to translate

2924
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:18,360
OK

2925
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:20,360
just it later this

2926
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:22,360
it came after this

2927
01:56:22,360 --> 01:56:24,360
Superstitious about this one again

2928
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,360
have to use

2929
01:56:26,360 --> 01:56:27,060
not document

2930
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:28,060
That means

2931
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:30,060
Thai is not good either

2932
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:32,060
Taibai is not good either

2933
01:56:32,060 --> 01:56:33,060
So it ends up taking

2934
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:35,060
subtext

2935
01:56:35,060 --> 01:56:36,060
OK

2936
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,060
this subject matter

2937
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:39,060
Let's translate this sacred book

2938
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:43,060
The subtext is written in the handwriting of foreigners

2939
01:56:43,060 --> 01:56:44,060
In fact, there will be no white

2940
01:56:44,060 --> 01:56:46,060
The kind of taste that the good country interprets

2941
01:56:46,060 --> 01:56:47,060
OK

2942
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:48,060
so

2943
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:51,060
The sacred book becomes one

2944
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:53,060
it's a mouthful to read

2945
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:54,060
one book

2946
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:55,060
OK

2947
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:57,060
I actually think this

2948
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:58,060
Well

2949
01:56:58,060 --> 01:56:59,060
Well

2950
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:00,060
rely on that

2951
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,020
He was affected by this dream of Jiu Zun

2952
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:06,860
In fact, the success of Wang Yepu's Guangxun Festival

2953
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:13,300
Also one, although he didn't make it clear

2954
01:57:13,300 --> 01:57:17,400
At least it was the prevailing social situation at that time

2955
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:18,500
he sees clearly

2956
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:19,720
because he can't follow

2957
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:21,440
because going to politics he

2958
01:57:22,060 --> 01:57:24,200
socialize with the upper class

2959
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:25,260
OK

2960
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:26,600
you can't date seven years

2961
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:28,040
you can't associate with nobles

2962
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,400
you want to date

2963
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:33,500
Then go to even give him this one special one fate

2964
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,000
scheduled to say

2965
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,700
You don't preach to the one above

2966
01:57:37,700 --> 01:57:38,200
OK

2967
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:42,800
You have to explain this Catholic truth to this world-class man

2968
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,800
nothing too big a problem with this

2969
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:45,500
OK

2970
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,600
i want these

2971
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:48,900
Of course it all contributed to why he

2972
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:51,800
in an era of pre-dragons

2973
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,000
He decided to use this vernacular

2974
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:55,600
to translate

2975
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:56,300
OK

2976
01:57:56,300 --> 01:57:58,700
Then I'll look at dating as a whole

2977
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:59,300
OK

2978
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,820
Probably this era of Limadou

2979
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:05,320
Limadou itself already uses the vernacular

2980
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:08,320
preaching to this lower class

2981
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:09,600
This is his more

2982
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:13,260
More time is spent with the upper layer

2983
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:17,720
So he also wrote that Catechism

2984
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:19,600
Q&A on transactions

2985
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:21,800
he wrote in vernacular

2986
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,960
Then you probably from this

2987
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:27,200
That's about 1605 or so.

2988
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:29,560
that book was engraved

2989
01:58:29,560 --> 01:58:32,160
you can look all the way down

2990
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,560
Seeing He Qingdai's era

2991
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,920
that jesus book written in vernacular

2992
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,960
There are more than fifty or sixty kinds

2993
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:40,680
OK

2994
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:43,720
If you want to search harder

2995
01:58:43,720 --> 01:58:45,280
Maybe there are more than fifty or sixty kinds

2996
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,600
OK

2997
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:47,840
i say the whole thing

2998
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:50,280
He Qingdai is the fifty or sixty kinds

2999
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:52,760
Or perhaps not only the fifty

3000
01:58:52,760 --> 01:58:54,560
some things we just can't see

3001
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,760
OK

3002
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:56,920
not yet visible

3003
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,040
OK

3004
01:58:58,040 --> 01:59:00,040
He wrote in these vernacular

3005
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,480
top performer

3006
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,080
he wrote the most

3007
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,400
most intentional

3008
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:05,320
And what?

3009
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,720
very very

3010
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:08,480
Interestingly

3011
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:12,400
This he is not like this traditional novel

3012
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:13,400
ok

3013
01:59:13,640 --> 01:59:15,440
What about traditional novels?

3014
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,440
vernacular novels have their fixed

3015
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:19,920
rhythm of speech

3016
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:20,880
ok

3017
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:23,480
this rhythm of writing

3018
01:59:23,720 --> 01:59:24,280
ok

3019
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:26,640
He Jinnai doesn't have this set at all

3020
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,640
the way he speaks

3021
01:59:28,640 --> 01:59:30,080
he writes articles

3022
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,160
sorry for the way this bible was translated

3023
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:35,080
like the way we write today

3024
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:38,000
We are actually speaking here today including me

3025
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,480
In fact, we all use the European topic

3026
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:42,760
speaking

3027
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:43,400
ok

3028
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,400
us

3029
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:47,360
not with the traditional

3030
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:48,400
Well

3031
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:49,520
Let's say this one

3032
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:49,840
Well

3033
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:51,560
The language in Western Europe

3034
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:53,600
Or the language in Hongaomeng

3035
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:54,720
speaking

3036
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,280
ok

3037
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,360
that language instant

3038
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,400
There is no way in the true biography

3039
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,040
ok

3040
01:59:59,040 --> 01:59:59,920
This article we

3041
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,200
Because there's going to be a rush to act

3042
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:05,200
OK

3043
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:16,760
Hello, thanks

3044
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:18,760
Thank you for the most extraordinary speech

3045
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,080
I actually have a question

3046
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:20,800
that is

3047
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,760
You said He Qingtai's vernacular nerves

3048
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:25,400
In fact, it affects the later

3049
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:27,680
That version of Loberto Morrison's

3050
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,440
to my limited knowledge

3051
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,400
I know Lobberto Morrison

3052
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,720
When he started to prevent the epidemic

3053
02:00:32,720 --> 02:00:34,640
he went to london

3054
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:37,360
Went to the British Museum

3055
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,320
copied one

3056
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,320
I don't know where it came from a nerve

3057
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,000
Then take him as the first book

3058
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,680
Then I met another person in Guangzhou

3059
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:46,520
A nerve gifted to him

3060
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,640
that's what you said

3061
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:50,240
It may be the version of He Qingtai mentioned

3062
02:00:50,240 --> 02:00:52,040
But they are generally

3063
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:53,720
It is still mainly in accordance with the

3064
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:56,160
The version in the British Museum

3065
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:57,000
I think

3066
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,240
I'd like to hear more from you about the ins and outs of this

3067
02:01:05,240 --> 02:01:05,940
Thanks

3068
02:01:05,940 --> 02:01:08,960
I certainly thought this one was supposed to be adapted to the right

3069
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:12,920
The impact on Doctor Cat should be a bit heavier

3070
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,920
because history says so

3071
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:16,760
That's what many people say

3072
02:01:16,760 --> 02:01:20,800
But when the text on the right

3073
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:24,280
There is no editor like this horse medical news

3074
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:26,640
you are so editing my words

3075
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:28,000
That's He Jintai

3076
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,400
He Jintai, he wants to Wen Baijiazai

3077
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,400
He can't have a gentle relationship

3078
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,120
ok

3079
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:37,040
He was also very uncouth when he was gentle with Bai’s family. This Chinese

3080
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:37,680
ok

3081
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:39,320
Not like vernacular, not like Wenyuan

3082
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:39,680
ok

3083
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:41,840
That's how Doctor Cat is translating

3084
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:42,480
ok

3085
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,240
Well

3086
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,560
this so

3087
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,320
Well

3088
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,360
I certainly can't say that this is a cat doctor

3089
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:51,080
Didn't receive this impact on the right side of this one

3090
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:54,200
I'm afraid that Dr. Cat's influence on the right side is quite big.

3091
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:55,040
ok

3092
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,280
But what?

3093
02:01:56,280 --> 02:02:00,120
He Jintai's stock gold body is also standing in front of Dr. Cat

3094
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,400
Because when Doctor Cat translated the Bible himself

3095
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:06,900
He himself listed several of his reference books

3096
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:10,500
The "Old and New Bible" is in this grade

3097
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,500
OK

3098
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,800
so i dare not say this one

3099
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:15,400
His influence

3100
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:19,600
The influence of the ancient and new bibles is so great that this one is bigger than the forty-one and two sides

3101
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:22,600
But it has an effect on the cat doctor

3102
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:25,800
At least my research so far

3103
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,300
as far as i know

3104
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:33,800
Let's compare their writing styles

3105
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:37,800
Perhaps it can be seen that Doctor Cat is more

3106
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:41,300
The 412 side of Pro is still more inclined

3107
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:45,800
the old new bible

3108
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:46,800
OK

3109
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,300
that takes a lot of time

3110
02:02:49,300 --> 02:02:50,300
OK thank you

3111
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:55,800
I think we are very thankful for this Christmas today

3112
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:57,800
I heard Li Sixue called

3113
02:02:57,800 --> 02:02:59,800
It turned into He Qingtai

3114
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Made a very in-depth and wonderful program

3115
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,000
thank you
