Actually, I know the words in Taiwan

67
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,720
Probably the two academicians

68
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,020
US National Academy of Medicine

69
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,120
ok let's go first

70
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,420
Warm applause to welcome the two academicians

71
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,420
Thanks

72
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,440
So if you don't mind, I just take off the mask

73
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
may be more clear

74
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Can you hear me from behind?

75
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,440
sure

76
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,040
First of all, thank you, Vice President Liu, for your invitation and introduction.

77
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
It's an honor to be here today

78
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,440
Just mentioned this Dean Wu Dayou

79
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I think everyone should probably be sick of him

80
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
understand to a certain extent

81
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,940
In my opinion it means

82
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,980
peak understanding of his tenure

83
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,980
Then when he Xie Ren, the two shows are breezy

84
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,980
his style

85
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,980
I think it can be said that we all have a style

86
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,980
So it is a great honor to be here today at a conference that bears his name.

87
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
inside a science lecture

88
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Let me share with you some things that I have always cared about

89
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,980
let me tell you the outline first

90
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,020
I briefly describe my personal background

91
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
Just now Vice President Liu mentioned

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,340
Let me go from math to biostatistics in public health

93
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,100
go from left to right

94
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,200
Then the combination of public health and medicine

95
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,640
Finally I want to share

96
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,140
this years

97
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,340
My own views on medical education

98
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,740
do some things

99
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
but i think maybe you guys

100
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,540
Years of work at the National Institutes of Health

101
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
So you may also care about this

102
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,740
Future trends in our healthcare sector

103
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,540
personal opinion

104
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,940
Finally I know there are a lot of young people today

105
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,940
even high school

106
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,740
And some young scholars

107
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,040
I want to share with you

108
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,840
some of my personal views

109
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,440
The medical education I talked about today

110
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,340
i guess i'm not a doctor

111
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,740
So maybe if you guys think I want to start with

112
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,640
A disease his mechanism may disappoint

113
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,540
I look at it from an educational point of view

114
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,440
So I think whole person education

115
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
higher education

116
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
When Taiwan's medical educator university

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So I want to cut in from these angles

118
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,500
I have loved counting since I was a child

119
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
So I think elementary school says

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,500
Just asked the principal to invite Mr. Rui to talk to us about new calculations

121
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,000
I found that I seemed to be able to answer them all.

122
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
also say these affirmations

123
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
good luck

124
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
I'll keep talking about this for a while

125
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,000
It's the teacher I met in elementary school, junior high school and high school

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
math teachers are good

127
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Keeps me interested without scrubbing it off

128
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,000
It's actually easy to grind

129
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,500
But let me keep going

130
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
i feel very grateful

131
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So my university went to the Department of Mathematics of Tsinghua University, where I was admitted.

132
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Went abroad in 1977

133
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,500
First go to a small school in the south for a master's degree

134
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,000
I didn't do well in college

135
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
play hard

136
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The only school that gave me a scholarship

137
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Gajin doesn't allow me to pay for it

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Then went to Seattle Washington University to study biostatistics

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We are reading this bio summary and don't need to do Post-Arts yet

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So I'm very lucky when I'm done

141
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
28 years before and after Johns Hopkins

142
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Central China Exchange

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
In establishment 1987

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
about half a year

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I noticed our Dali Hall

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Actually I'm like a Renovation

147
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
used to be full of old

148
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
looks great now

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There is also a year of lectures at the National Taiwan University School of Public Health

150
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
when the new School of Public Health broke away from the School of Medicine

151
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
At that time, I helped to become a program of biometrics

152
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
middle in state department

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Associate Dean of Course for Three Years

154
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Then retired in the US 12 years ago

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Ex-principal at Yang Ming University

156
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Then in December 2017

157
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I've been at the State Department until now

158
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
math and science

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When I was a child, I don't know if you have heard of

160
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Mathematics is the mother of science

161
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I've actually been listening to this since I was a kid

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,260
It may mean that our age is about the same generation

163
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,200
But I'll talk to him now when I get back

164
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,900
It seems that the old people have never heard of it

165
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,760
more senior

166
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,640
I don't want to say he doesn't want to encounter painful memories from the past

167
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,600
Even math is painful

168
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
no one admits

169
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,540
But in fact it is clear

170
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,240
In my opinion is a mathematics is the mother of science

171
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,540
I remember that our point doesn't seem to be very...

172
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
How about it

173
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
this car

174
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,900
So this is up and down too?

175
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,800
this is above

176
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,640
up and down

177
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,140
OK

178
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,200
i want to use this

179
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,800
good

180
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,700
Actually we are...

181
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,600
I remember that I majored in group theory in my sophomore year.

182
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
The depletion of junior repair

183
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,240
senior year geometry

184
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,100
In fact, it was very abstract at first

185
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,500
Learn more later

186
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,900
In fact, in many applications

187
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,140
Like group theory is basically

188
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,040
So the symmetry of a natural phenomenon

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So it's in chemistry

190
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I understand that he is explaining some of his phenomena

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There is also the theory of detachment, which is basically a combination of set theory.

192
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Understanding space, latitude, and the whole shift

193
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Like this is a phenomenon explained by the theory of detachment

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
set of dimensions

195
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Everyone has heard of Academician Yang Zhenning

196
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What is the practicality of the physics he did?

197
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Talking to Chen Xingsen who used to be in Berkeley

198
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What Su Xue taught is the field of dimensional set

199
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
In fact, his field is very important to him

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Explanation application in physics is a great help

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And of course we are now like these years of COVID-19

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We now have to look at the model we understand to make prediction

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
May be when will peak etc.

204
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Like these are mathematical I think a lot of applications

205
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Mathematics, I think since childhood, you have been saying

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Then there is him one is black and white

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This matter is yes or no

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Welcome to the proof that we seem to define

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
if A then B nothing

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
so no room for negotiation

211
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
welcome is no uncertainty

212
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a feature of mathematics

213
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
from its i think from the front

214
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Mathematics is because logic is emphasized in the process

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Logical thinking is very important

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
but to do things is to have principles

217
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
When this person is different

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Should it be principled or flexible?

219
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I personally think it is more inclined

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Some have principles and some follow

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
might be more appropriate

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This is my son Liang Chaogang

223
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm going to talk about math

224
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I made some to be a teacher

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Middle and high school teacher also works as a professor

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I want to emphasize this

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's not just math

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Maintaining interest in any field is not easy

229
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There are fields of interest

230
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Not difficult

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
It's not easy to keep going

232
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,440
And it's so easy to lose interest

233
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,520
my old

234
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,120
He also liked mathematics since he was a child

235
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,520
I remember when I was a child

236
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,280
I help him with his homework at night

237
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,920
he is very new

238
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,560
he wrote

239
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,480
he is the answer

240
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,720
He didn't give it in the middle

241
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,080
inside his head

242
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
so i'm going to see say

243
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
if there is an answer later

244
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,760
if not the same

245
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,320
do it all over again

246
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,280
If he writes the process

247
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,120
we will discuss clearly

248
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
this is one of his traits

249
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,640
then to high school

250
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,200
American high school four years

251
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,440
So it's ninth grade ten years

252
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,920
in the first and second year

253
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,480
He went home with a total complaint

254
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Said he was not interested in mathematics

255
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,160
He complained very deeply to the teacher

256
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,040
I don't think so

257
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,560
We are all two mothers and three thousand

258
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,680
we'll move over there

259
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
because the school is good

260
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,200
I think the teacher should be very good

261
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
Then one day suddenly

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,680
he brought home

263
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,800
the teacher said

264
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,360
He said our son plagiarized

265
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,760
we take this too seriously

266
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,320
we will meet him

267
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,480
also to understand

268
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,080
Later I learned that our children can talk

269
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,760
This teacher has actually

270
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,000
They maintained pre-calculus from the beginning of high school

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,160
This teacher no longer has this ability

272
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,080
So he has been reading from the book in class

273
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,200
or call them homework

274
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,640
If he is doing homework, he may see his paper and give the answer

275
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,880
He thinks his plagiarism

276
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,720
In fact, they'll know about his daughter herself.

277
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,240
There are also some racial discrimination in it

278
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,640
So then we do this interpretation

279
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,560
But what this tells us

280
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,000
The saddest thing for me is his grade

281
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,200
America uses ABC

282
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,480
I used to change A to C

283
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,360
I don't think so

284
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,800
it's that he's lost interest

285
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,520
This is the saddest thing for me

286
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,840
Then we will meet the teacher

287
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,880
They said he was originally from the United States

288
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,960
he's good

289
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
he won't let you say skip class

290
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
he is looking at your field

291
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
so he is good at math

292
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,040
maybe he's taller

293
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,920
At this time they said

294
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,960
You should go back to the front like this

295
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
then we will follow that

296
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,560
The leader of the mathematics team discussed with him

297
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,160
He said if you insist

298
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,280
let him say

299
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,360
you want to sign

300
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,000
Otherwise we are not responsible

301
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,160
we thought about it for a long time

302
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,760
my guy

303
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,960
We think we should let him continue

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It turns out that level

305
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
In the end, I met that teacher in the last two years

306
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
very good

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
let him engage in interests

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and not only that

309
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
how is his university

310
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Also select those math

311
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
we asked him

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What do you think of this teacher?

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know being a high school classmate

314
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Or what about the old high school?

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
we speak

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
probably spoke in high school

317
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
nothing nice

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
he kept saying

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
he speaks in english

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He said the teacher

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He knows what he is talking about

322
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is actually a very high complement

323
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
so this happened to me

324
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
on one's own child

325
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
a teacher without

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
remember can make him lose interest

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
but a good teacher

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
what can he do

329
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Re-realize

330
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and inspire him

331
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
able to walk the field

332
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So I guess this means

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Passion for teaching is very very important

334
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It is the influence of the Buddha world with or without eyes

335
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
it's a cause of conscience

336
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The impact is far-reaching

337
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think this resonates with everyone

338
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Later after going abroad

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Go to the Operations Conference to the University of Washington in Seattle that kind of Biostatistics

340
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
at that time

341
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This school for biostatistics should be one of the best places

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Biostatistics is basically an instrumental science

343
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We use a tool to help you to help the scientist

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It basically takes complex data from where to what

345
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Provided to life scientists to make a conclusion

346
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is simply like this

347
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So what's the biometrics challenge like here?

348
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
have a certain degree of inaccuracy

349
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
How can it be inaccurate?

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
maybe because of something

351
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We spend limited time

352
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I hope to finish this research in a few years

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So the sample size must not be enough

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What if the sample size is not enough?

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If someone else is doing the same, do 100

356
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sample 100 words

357
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The result may be different

358
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
has its uncertainty

359
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
In addition, the measurement error

360
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If we do epidemiological research like now

361
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Measure blood pressure, general physical fitness, do 30

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because you see, the same time is actually very short

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
There is its Veration in it

364
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
And is the amount itself really good?

365
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,200
Like we are now looking at whether smoking is related to disease

366
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,500
For smoking, we ask you how many packs you smoke

367
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
this is not very inaccurate

368
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,600
That's how accurate it is

369
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,100
So you have to measure it out of your urine

370
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,200
how much do you really suck in

371
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
So this in itself also creates some inaccuracies

372
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,100
In addition, our scientific knowledge is still limited

373
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Therefore, our conclusions may be challenged by others

374
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,300
So basically, so to face is to choose here

375
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,000
Then hopefully statistics can be used as a tool to assist scientists as well

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,900
Just to reduce the influence of this aspect on our conclusion

377
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
So we've all probably heard of the extra-mental space

378
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,600
So I'm going to watch this to know the height of the class

379
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,200
how many say i won't give you a number

380
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,800
I'll give you a space somewhere between this

381
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,600
So this is our statistical problem

382
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,900
Between biostatistics and mathematics

383
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,200
In fact, it was just a comparison

384
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,100
Just remembered I said that math emphasis is

385
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,800
no uncertainty

386
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
The stats don't

387
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
Without in certain, there will be no statistics

388
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,720
But what about the two

389
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,040
I think the statistical one is art

390
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
like we may be different collars

391
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,720
The same statistics may have different thinking

392
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,640
Do the same thing and see different interpretations

393
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,920
like a work of art

394
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,680
Maybe we look at it from another angle

395
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,920
So this same interpretation is not the same

396
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,440
But for us studying mathematics is our tool

397
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,640
as statistics are to scientists as a tool

398
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,840
So we have to make good use of statistics

399
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,360
I hope that some good tools will be developed

400
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,360
So biostatistics are important to human health

401
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,720
I want to be simple in twenty four seasons

402
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
I will list three points first

403
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,720
This may just more or less reflect

404
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,320
The research I am participating in is more

405
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,600
The first in the evaluation of new drugs

406
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,560
Benefits for patients with chronic diseases

407
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,760
Is it Efficacy

408
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
Then this is a field of statistics

409
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,160
Called survival analysis Survivor Analysis

410
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,080
This background is like this

411
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,440
Twenty four seasons I want to go through

412
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,280
After the end of the twenty-four seasons war

413
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,840
At that time the common people

414
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,520
Start off richer

415
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,120
So everyone eats well

416
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,600
A lot of food is more like the beginning of McDonald's

417
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,440
So many of these chronic diseases include cancer

418
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,680
Including that heart disease and so on

419
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,640
So a lot of new drugs happen

420
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
developed

421
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
So do clinical trials

422
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Generally, if you often experiment

423
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
people with the same disease

424
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,320
Divide it into two groups at once, right?

425
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,480
One group was treated with a new drug

426
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,280
possible control group

427
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Let's see if the new drug can live longer

428
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,320
sounds simple doesn't it

429
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,680
how many days does each live

430
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,880
Taking an average is the so-called T-Test

431
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,960
Maybe you have heard

432
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,360
where is the problem

433
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,560
The problem is that the disease

434
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,160
may live long

435
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,520
But I may within three years

436
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,360
like finishing this research

437
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,320
So within three years

438
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,120
how is he

439
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,840
alive

440
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,760
i know what

441
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,160
he lived at least three years, didn't he

442
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,240
then this may be longer

443
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,040
another thing maybe when i come in

444
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,340
probably left after a year

445
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,080
then i know he lived at least a year

446
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,280
like this so-called cancer

447
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,640
to shadow people

448
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,880
So this is becoming a

449
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Survival analysis becomes a when

450
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,200
From 1950 to 1970 was a very red

451
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Many doctoral dissertations come out of this

452
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,200
i want to show you

453
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,900
Here is an example

454
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,800
it's breast cancer

455
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
it is not a clinical laboratory

456
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
It means three different kinds of elegance

457
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
I want to know if it's some kind of elegance

458
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,800
it survives better

459
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,600
look like this

460
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
for example it looks like this

461
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,800
just a few months later

462
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
how likely is it to survive

463
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,000
Probably around 60%

464
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
used here

465
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,720
This is a so-called

466
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,400
Curtain Maier

467
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,800
this article

468
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,200
This article 1958

469
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
these two are totally on their own

470
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,000
do not recognize

471
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,900
self-developed

472
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,900
At the same time put that paper

473
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,100
review to this journal

474
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,200
As a result, the editor-in-chief of the journal will

475
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,500
combined into one

476
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
write an article out

477
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,200
is very classic

478
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
In other words

479
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,500
Just came out 30 years ago

480
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,800
There, a statistical method was developed

481
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,700
what is the theoretical basis

482
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,000
A group of statistical offices in the Nordics

483
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
to be found in the eighteenth century

484
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,640
At that time, some of the French

485
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,940
they are gambling words

486
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,340
There is a process called Possess

487
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,840
Stochastic process

488
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,140
How to predict the next step

489
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,440
That's called Modengill

490
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,740
The result can be used

491
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,600
So here is an example

492
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,900
Basic research is very important

493
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,140
You don't know when you will definitely need it

494
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,540
But what might the research you're doing now witness?

495
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,440
some new discoveries of yours

496
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,140
This is actually a very important concept

497
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
then back to the second

498
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,480
The disease is still unknown

499
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,380
Every medicine will still work

500
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,300
So everyone should understand

501
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,780
and it will be expensive

502
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,280
Is that from a prevention point of view?

503
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,380
Hope to find out the risk factor soon

504
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,280
can be prevented from happening

505
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,640
so this is an epidemic

506
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,080
risk factor

507
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,180
Then hope to be able to enter as soon as possible

508
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
For example, if you find that smoking is serious

509
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,480
Is that the way of guarding?

510
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,680
It is to encourage everyone not to smoke

511
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,480
Or already smoked this way

512
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
A health education so that everyone can quit smoking

513
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Then how to find this risk factor

514
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,680
This epidemiological approach

515
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
an example of this

516
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,800
A practical example of this research done in France is

517
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,680
stone road cliff

518
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,560
Back then they had a hypothesis

519
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,960
The hypothesis is whether it has something to do with drinking and smoking

520
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,720
So this kind of smoking him

521
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,200
Drinking divides into two groups of people

522
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,880
Is this sick or not?

523
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,920
Divided into six groups of different ages

524
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,960
because what age might be like

525
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,280
getting older

526
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,560
This drink may be more

527
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,680
As we get older we also know

528
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,440
The risk to Shidaoya is relatively high

529
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,640
so he's basically a disruptor

530
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,680
So if you take this into account

531
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,840
This is relatively simple

532
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,800
but think about it now

533
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,600
Many diseases may have several risk sites

534
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,400
how to think about

535
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,560
So this in the 1970's era

536
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,240
is a very red field

537
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,560
this is main this is

538
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,360
Bressel and Day

539
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,080
this is my thesis

540
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,120
Professor Michinoshima

541
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,040
I'll mention him later

542
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,280
with a book they're writing

543
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,320
is a very classic book

544
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
The third is back in clinical trials

545
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
in 1980

546
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That's when ez disease was discovered

547
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Then do clinical trials

548
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
but it will take a long time

549
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
so at that time

550
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There are many comparisons in ez disease

551
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Relatively high knowledge

552
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They went to the US FDA

553
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
to ask why it took so long

554
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Why can it be faster

555
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
can make a decision

556
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Do you want to pass

557
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
At that time also found

558
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
There is one in ez disease

559
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Called BioMarker

560
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
biological indicator

561
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
It's in the blood pressure

562
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
CD4 anti

563
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
If your CD4 antibody keeps dropping

564
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
you're probably going to get ez disease

565
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So think about it

566
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
My research may say

567
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
less than a year

568
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
blood drawn every two months

569
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Your CD4 antibody

570
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
look at new drugs

571
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Is it to reduce the speed you slow down

572
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Like this is called Prinimposed Design

573
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So now in Body

574
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
is very popular

575
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
This is a study I have participated in

576
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,600
This is with schizophrenia

577
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,400
It is a study related to visual debugging.

578
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,300
Everyone measured several times

579
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,800
See if it's a new drug

580
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,300
will make it the severity of the disease

581
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,000
can slow down

582
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,600
The main thing here is that Vice President Liu just mentioned

583
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
it's me and my colleagues

584
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,800
Articles in Huffman 1860

585
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,600
It is now becoming a regular use

586
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,500
This data analysis

587
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,300
OK

588
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,600
so these few

589
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,900
I want to give a few examples

590
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,100
Biological Education of the Twentieth Century

591
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,900
Actually plays a very important role

592
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,000
Assist scientists to be able to deal with some

593
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,500
I want to cover important health-related issues

594
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,300
this is for me

595
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,500
but i think about it

596
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,800
This is my first breakpoint in the production of drugs

597
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,600
Because at that time to study biometrics

598
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,700
just know

599
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,500
The love of mathematics does not need to give up

600
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,100
you can still like math

601
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,500
But it can be translated into human health

602
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,700
raised above attention

603
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,700
develop new tools

604
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,500
This is a way of no return for me

605
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,600
In fact, it doesn't matter if I remember back then

606
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,700
Biometrics is still the same

607
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,800
If the market is very red pharmaceutical factory

608
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,300
He wants you to be a root forest researcher

609
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,500
to develop new drugs together

610
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,700
he can't you do research

611
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,800
So he pays you more

612
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
school is already low

613
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,100
So absolutely sure that's what I'm trying to say

614
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,200
I am interested in research

615
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,300
So make a decision to stay in school

616
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,200
This is what I just said

617
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
Why did you measure it several times just now?

618
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,600
Why traditional methods cannot be used

619
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,700
Traditional statistical methods assume that

620
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,300
There is no correlation between the two data

621
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,000
I tell you this is blood pressure

622
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Can you disassemble another blood pressure

623
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,600
you can't tear it apart

624
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
But if the same person is measured several times

625
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,900
The last time the amount was 140

626
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
take a guess next time you guess probably

627
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,700
You are going to 145 and 110

628
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
guess which one

629
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,500
140 for sure

630
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,900
Because of its so-called correlation

631
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,300
You can see that this is a very strong correlation

632
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,700
So this becomes a

633
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Some new statistical methods

634
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,640
to deal with this problem

635
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,240
the one i just mentioned

636
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,080
In fact, the director of the three fields just now

637
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,920
he is involved

638
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,200
He is a

639
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,840
He's a biometric with this attitude

640
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,920
Pioneer

641
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,280
It's a pity to do charity in 2015

642
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,400
February 2016

643
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,000
At that time I was already in Yangming

644
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,280
in that play

645
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,480
Department of Biostatistics

646
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,400
Organized a Memorial for him

647
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,040
that day he said to do

648
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,080
Celebration of Norm's Life

649
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,800
He's No. 1 Norm

650
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
I go there to participate

651
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,480
I am from Special Central Taiwan to participate in

652
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,680
That day was a lot of his friends

653
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,040
his student

654
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,520
And family members are telling some of their old stories

655
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,600
many very touching

656
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,160
I found that I didn't know him well before

657
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,840
because he is famous

658
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,560
and he is serious

659
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,600
I don't usually dare to touch him.

660
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,240
But that time I knew a lot about him

661
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,640
in the process of coming back

662
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,160
I use me to lose

663
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,200
I have more than 3000 now

664
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,240
many facebook friends

665
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Many of them are Yangming students

666
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,080
I just write him down

667
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,580
It's also a memorial

668
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,240
then a good friend of mine

669
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,740
He's on my show and he posted it

670
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,180
People's poems set people's faces

671
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,440
No random admission of students without meritorious service

672
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,040
poem doesn't have to precede address

673
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
address needn't be worse than poem

674
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,580
he said over there

675
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,640
Just how many of them that day

676
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,000
his friend said

677
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,740
This famous professor

678
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,940
You can imagine he must have taken a lot of students

679
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,440
no

680
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,640
He was between twenty and thirty years

681
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,880
Only accept about ten students

682
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,280
I am the fourth

683
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:33,680
Why

684
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,440
he will be very suspicious

685
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,680
He wants you to find the topic yourself

686
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
So most people don't dare to look for him

687
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,580
he won't say

688
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
able to overcharge students

689
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,780
can have more articles

690
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,840
he's not like that

691
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,340
he has a high

692
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,080
high standard

693
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,780
no merit

694
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,280
I did it with him then

695
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,940
Then I will find the topic myself

696
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,180
Then I will find the paper myself

697
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,980
come and see for yourself

698
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,280
But he also every week

699
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,480
discuss with me

700
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,680
But one day he found

701
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,680
he felt already

702
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,020
he can't go

703
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,880
He has no way to help in that field

704
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,840
He told me to talk to a teacher in the math department

705
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,400
go with him

706
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,800
Later, I was asking the internal teacher

707
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,840
The internal teachers are also very good

708
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,040
math teacher

709
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,280
it was summer vacation

710
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,140
he just told me

711
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,000
They don't see each other during summer vacation

712
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,200
this is my home phone number

713
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,600
call if you need

714
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,140
I will come the next day

715
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,940
so this kind

716
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,700
That is to say, this academic pursuit

717
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
care for students

718
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,200
I was a graduate

719
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,140
to follow

720
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,500
Back to me and our profile professor

721
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,340
follow him

722
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,880
I have an article written

723
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,180
I said I hope you will do it together

724
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,340
he said no

725
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,040
He said I didn't contribute much to you

726
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
He said you should find another

727
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,680
That was the original introduction

728
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,380
I told the guy

729
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:40,680
don't want

730
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,740
I because of you

731
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,380
You find an article very interesting

732
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,140
this style

733
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Actually it affects me

734
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,780
pumping students after hopkins

735
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,840
I think I

736
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,040
Didn't help him

737
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,640
I just say

738
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,180
hang yourself

739
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,540
don't use me as a slogan

740
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,840
You can get more than one ackenagement

741
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,080
there is no need to suspect disciples

742
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
When I arrived in Hakeng

743
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
i just followed me

744
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I just mentioned that article by Liu Puxiang

745
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Our 1986 publication

746
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Generally, this total article will be about thirteen years later

747
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
will slowly be affirmed

748
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Turns out we were affirmed within four years

749
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Then at the annual meeting

750
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Invited to lecture for a day

751
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
we teach four lessons

752
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
half an hour per class

753
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
we two take turns talking

754
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I was actually held in that hotel that day

755
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
More than a hundred people

756
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
early in the morning we went to the front

757
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I look back

758
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
made the first row of water

759
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
professor

760
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I was taken aback by this scene

761
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The first one is our master

762
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
he came to listen

763
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and the students are talking

764
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
remind me

765
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
This means to live and learn

766
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The second is that he can't say

767
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
because i am a teacher

768
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
It seems to be listening to the students

769
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
seems to have no face

770
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I think this is a

771
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I think it's a very friendly demeanor

772
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,880
He told his friends that he likes to climb mountains

773
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
he has skis

774
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,800
He conquered the Matterhorn when he was 16

775
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,200
It's interesting to say that he went to the Department of Forestry at the beginning of his university

776
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,880
Later, I experimented with business

777
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
They have to climb a mountain to study math

778
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,400
Do you think this is a strange idea

779
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,200
If he is like this, he can climb to the top of the mountain and sit down and read a book

780
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
So he is a very special

781
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,000
then he is a leader

782
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,600
senior leadership

783
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
what are you talking about

784
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
After hearing him say that, he found

785
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
That colleague is always in the front according to his picture

786
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
he walks ahead

787
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,600
I'll think back to the inside of his office

788
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,800
He put a piece of paper on it

789
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,200
There is a leader who follows his path

790
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
he is totally one

791
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,600
So the research he did was very forward-looking.

792
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,200
You can see this should be very arrogant

793
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,400
no

794
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,000
Because he likes to climb mountains

795
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
he whole world

796
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
run to many places to climb mountains

797
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,300
So he talked a lot with the local residents

798
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,800
go to a lot of chat

799
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
to understand each other's culture

800
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,700
I will remember when I was reading to him

801
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
He talked to me about things in Taiwan

802
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,200
he is very focused

803
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
he's looking at you

804
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
very focused

805
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,900
he for anything

806
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
He therefore he is very humble

807
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
very respectful

808
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,600
It's a pity for me

809
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,900
when he was alive

810
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
no chance to learn more

811
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I can't think of the next opportunity to share with you

812
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
From vital statistics to public health

813
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,500
what is public health

814
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Public Health

815
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't know what public health people think

816
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,900
Is it from the toilet and then wash your hands

817
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,200
It might be the idea that the comparison arises

818
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,100
In fact, public health is a field

819
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
A discipline is a maintenance

820
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
or really enter the field of health

821
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,600
What he emphasized

822
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,300
emphasize a few important

823
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
compared with medicine

824
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The doctor is my responsibility

825
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
for my patients

826
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
best care

827
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
A certain group of public health officials

828
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
like a smoker

829
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
this group

830
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Is he more dangerous?

831
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
so shall we do something

832
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
do some sanitation

833
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
to change his behavior

834
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Therefore, in addition, public health emphasizes prevention

835
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hope to say sooner

836
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
can prevent him from getting this disease

837
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
In addition to that

838
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
After this time

839
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I hope that some policies can be introduced

840
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
For example, after the health education

841
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
let the community inside

842
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Everyone can quit smoking

843
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
so this is very important

844
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
public health emphasis

845
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Inside the School of General Public Health

846
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
There are four main axes

847
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Biostatistics and Epidemiology

848
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Additional Health Policy

849
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
sanitation

850
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
but i remembered

851
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I think the group is healthy

852
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
probably higher than public health

853
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He remembered because of hygiene

854
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
will compare that

855
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
The concept of washing hands

856
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
actually because of health

857
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
more positive thinking

858
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
let me say this by the way

859
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
there are several nouns

860
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,240
public health international health and global health

861
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,200
The epidemic in recent years

862
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,440
I think you may have heard

863
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,240
global health matter

864
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I actually think that global health and global health

865
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,880
is a trend in the future

866
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,600
what it emphasizes

867
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,200
Peer-to-peer care for each other rather than selfishness

868
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,400
In fact, public health, international health

869
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,800
This feeling of being private is

870
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,200
developed country

871
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,040
I'll take care of your undeveloped

872
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,080
Don't be weak and have no resources

873
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,880
I'm here to help you

874
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,000
actually not

875
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,400
some may occur in undeveloped countries

876
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,280
But because of what happened to them

877
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,200
If he provides the information

878
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,880
Let these worlds reciprocate

879
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,280
So it's an equivalence concept

880
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,680
so i'm going

881
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,640
I think it's called global health

882
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,240
this is the right idea

883
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,160
But back to this new crown pneumonia

884
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
I also saw one thing

885
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,680
even so

886
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,600
I don't know if you feel it

887
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,920
In fact, what is the weak difference?

888
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,080
still stand out

889
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
You are now seeing several vaccines being developed

890
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
how about a few rich countries

891
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,640
How much to buy at once

892
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
They have the money to hang on

893
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,340
countries like africa

894
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,680
finally they give them

895
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,300
For the one he probably didn't know about them either

896
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,980
The sanitation system is no way to do that

897
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,600
This vaccine can be distributed to various places

898
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,640
So in fact, I think there is still a long time

899
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,140
a long way to go

900
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,540
I will give a few examples now

901
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,100
public health

902
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,340
In fact, playing a very important role

903
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,080
Like it's COVID-19

904
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,380
This is the actual data

905
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,640
In this situation it should be 2010

906
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,180
How much in 2010

907
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,640
2010

908
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,940
blue 2019

909
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,940
just how much it should be

910
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,740
109 to 108

911
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,080
what is this

912
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,680
You see this compared to the previous year

913
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,880
Has the number of patients with flu decreased?

914
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
because during the epidemic

915
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,600
In addition, the number of severe cases of influenza has also decreased a lot.

916
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
This is the number of outpatient visits

917
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
What is this because the pneumonia caused by the flu is reduced

918
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
how to explain

919
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
This flu has nothing to do with COVID-19, right?

920
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But what do you all have in common?

921
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
wear mask

922
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
In fact, wearing a mask is actually because everyone sees

923
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
In fact, this will play a very important role from the perspective of prevention.

924
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Not only so long virus

925
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The long virus is almost like a child before the age of 15

926
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It starts to rise almost every April and May

927
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You look at this is the front this is 2020, 109 years

928
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
This is the average of the previous 5 years

929
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
what do you see

930
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Does it keep going up until April and May?

931
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The result is not up and down

932
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
what reason

933
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
when everyone kisses

934
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
including children

935
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and thus get this

936
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,080
This and that long virus may be much less

937
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,880
However, their numbers in Singapore this year seem to be higher than usual.

938
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,400
Because the epidemic seems to be calming down now

939
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,880
because of negligence later

940
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,600
So many things still need to be

941
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,280
nothing is absolute

942
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,320
I will give another example

943
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,080
This is a study done at the State Department

944
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,280
Have you ever heard of lung cancer?

945
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,280
There is a drug called IRISA

946
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,520
Then ten years ago

947
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,280
They did a US study

948
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,640
how did you find out

949
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,520
The same person with lung cancer is not everyone

950
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,600
useful for this drug

951
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,520
Or find a mutation that may be related to a certain gene

952
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,880
It is related to EGFR

953
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,080
If that mutation is valid today

954
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,760
If it doesn't, it won't work

955
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,640
But the words of the United States

956
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,880
They just have this mutation and only 10 percent of it

957
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,400
As a result, our State Department research found that

958
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,760
In Taiwan, many of them are volitional

959
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,600
different culture

960
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,760
different races

961
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,120
We have almost 50% of the mutation

962
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,160
and there is this

963
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,780
He works without a suggester

964
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,340
So after this research develops

965
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,040
We'll go to the NHS for advice.

966
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,500
So then they changed their policy

967
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,500
Originally, this Erisis was the third line

968
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,940
or become tuned to the front line

969
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,380
Because it was found that for this virus

970
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,380
He helps these patients

971
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,440
So this is an example

972
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,980
is what we just said

973
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,780
The importance of public health groups is policy

974
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,440
Here is an example

975
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,640
Only current affairs can suggest a policy for the government

976
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,580
join the common people

977
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,880
but at the same time

978
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,380
This new drug is slowly emerging

979
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,580
what will happen

980
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,780
drug resistance

981
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,380
So we have a research institute for crude drugs

982
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,380
on the development of new fourth-generation drugs

983
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,280
so simply say

984
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,140
State Department Research We Do

985
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,640
In fact, a hope that can have a scientific effect

986
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,940
Can have social or policy effects

987
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,680
In addition, there is the effect of production and education

988
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,080
Here is an example

989
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,540
Well, I just talked about public health

990
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,380
make a brief introduction

991
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,080
I will talk about

992
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,560
That is, we are going to talk about medical education today

993
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,600
From my point of view, public health

994
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,160
My wish is that I never had any contact before

995
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,460
To the United States have a public health

996
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,500
then to medicine

997
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:16,140
This is Johns Hopkins' founding dean of the School of Public Health

998
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,700
Call Winnon Welch

999
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,560
He was the first dean of the School of Public Health for ten years

1000
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,900
That name is School Hidging and Public Health

1001
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,440
I'll give a simple explanation later

1002
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,240
He used to be the dean of medicine

1003
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
However, during the tenure of his dean, the dean of medicine discovered that

1004
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,840
In fact, there are many diseases

1005
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,240
use existing drugs

1006
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,240
Still can't make him heal

1007
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,540
So he went to Germany to learn

1008
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,540
Come back and bring back the concept of prevention

1009
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,340
So set up this academy

1010
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,940
called Hidging

1011
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,240
Hidging later this after I went over there

1012
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,940
The teacher in the doctor is discussing

1013
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,140
That means removing Hidging's name

1014
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,740
Why

1015
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,040
When I think of Hidging I think it's washing my hands

1016
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
actually you might

1017
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,500
look at that dictionary

1018
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,400
In Germany by sea

1019
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,300
yes there it is a

1020
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,600
Science that maintains health

1021
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,000
It is a very profound noun

1022
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
when the former governor of new york

1023
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
Mayor Michael Bloomberg

1024
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
He donated a lot of money to the School of Public Health

1025
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,700
Then the name was changed

1026
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,300
It becomes Broomberg School

1027
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,800
Pobby House

1028
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,000
So this Haijin disappeared

1029
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,600
Anyway

1030
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,700
This is the founding dean

1031
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,400
He founded the School of Public Health

1032
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,800
Since 1916

1033
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,000
Harworth is America's second 1923

1034
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,300
Both public health schools are

1035
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,000
Funding system of Rock Fair Foundation established

1036
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm going to talk about this

1037
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,000
in 1970

1038
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,300
There is a Pisper University professor

1039
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,500
he wrote a book

1040
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,900
He challenges the appropriateness of the medical-public-health dichotomy

1041
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,300
Because there used to be only medical school, right?

1042
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,800
Now pull out a school of public health

1043
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,900
seems to become

1044
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,700
This medical school is responsible for diagnosis and treatment

1045
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,100
Prevention and governance of public health

1046
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,200
He does his Challenge

1047
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,100
He thinks the dichotomy shouldn't be done

1048
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I personally agree with his approach

1049
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This does not keep the public health students back

1050
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
No, because I think it is very important for public health and hygiene to be taken seriously

1051
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But in the process, we should not look at this matter with a dichotomy

1052
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I want to give an example

1053
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's a pity that he passed away not long ago

1054
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
At this time we were in the United States as pediatricians for our two young children

1055
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
If you live in the United States, you will see a pediatrician regularly for vaccinations when you are young.

1056
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
or something

1057
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
this one , he ' s a good example

1058
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I think healthcare workers should be on the front line of prevention

1059
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Rather than medical staff who are only responsible for the entire order and treatment

1060
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
This is the second child, Tony Leung, he got married in May this year

1061
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
What I'm trying to say is that the story I'm telling is about him

1062
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
We had just moved to

1063
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Later it was the principle of that school

1064
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
good school district

1065
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
let's inquire

1066
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Just like this Dr. Michael May

1067
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
to make an appointment with him

1068
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
to meet him

1069
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
we took two kids

1070
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
That's five years older

1071
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
The second child is just over a year old

1072
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
that this one

1073
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
don't forget the pediatrician

1074
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
He saw our boss and asked him

1075
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
you don't ride a bike

1076
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
America is bigger

1077
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
so everything is ok

1078
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
just ride your bike outside

1079
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Our boss said yes

1080
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Then guess what he asked next

1081
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
do you wear a helmet

1082
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I was still a little surprised

1083
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
still stuck in the old concept

1084
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
In fact, he is in practice proper health

1085
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
he reminds you

1086
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
you don't wear mouth push

1087
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Actually what he said

1088
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
may be more effective than parental

1089
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
After two or three years

1090
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
one day

1091
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
our second

1092
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
he from the outside

1093
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
play outside

1094
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
he comes in

1095
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
he has more than one foot

1096
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Our name is skateboard

1097
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Do you have

1098
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
do you know that

1099
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
that climbing board

1100
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
he showed us

1101
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
The front part of the helmet is so long and thick with a sunken

1102
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You can think about what's going on, it's obviously off balance, what about the head

1103
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
hit that side of that place

1104
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
If you think about it, if it didn't wear a helmet over there, it would be an injury

1105
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The influence of the family, and the entire society, may have to undergo surgery, which will have a great impact on the whole

1106
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
But I think because of its relationship, it suggested that it has to do it

1107
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
I think it's a physician don't forget, I think it can do a lot in prevention

1108
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It does another thing, and the same dick

1109
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
How about when he was young we lived in two or three years old and I lived in him watching TV

1110
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Blink like that over there, we'll tell him to stop

1111
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
He used it at that time, he said I can't help it, I can't help it

1112
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Later we heard the boss Bao Bao said that we went out together, and the two of them sat in the back

1113
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The boss heard his brother's side

1114
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
because he can't control

1115
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
So we heard a few words from him saying he can't help it

1116
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Let's go see this Dr. Michael May

1117
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
After he listened to my name

1118
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
say right away

1119
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,000
What is it like to refer me to Halhus

1120
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
This does Therese syndrome

1121
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
This is a French doctor who invented it

1122
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
This Discovery this new this

1123
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
this syndrome

1124
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Then go see this Halhus

1125
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It is also well-known in the United States in this field.

1126
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Then he let us show him

1127
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
After he listened to our description

1128
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
He said right away he was Therese syndrome

1129
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Then he asked us this

1130
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
one thing for our kids

1131
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
He said when you were at school

1132
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
He is about five or six years old

1133
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
when you were at school

1134
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Did any of your classmates come and cancel you?

1135
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
because it seems weird that you do this a lot

1136
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
he said no

1137
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
He said why did I ask

1138
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
If there is, I will prescribe medicine for you

1139
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
If you can, don't open it

1140
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
if not we don't drive

1141
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
We fell in love with him when he was in first grade

1142
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Let's talk to the instructor about his situation

1143
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
help us pay attention

1144
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
If a student has this situation

1145
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
To let us know what we see is dealt with

1146
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
So I put it here to say

1147
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
This is actually called preventive medicine.

1148
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Pirrandian Medicine

1149
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
what is the doctor doing

1150
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
say prevention above

1151
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
by talking to patients or

1152
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
or the interaction of different people

1153
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
able to play this preventive role

1154
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
ok then i think

1155
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Next, let's go to the medical side

1156
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
then i want to spend some time talking

1157
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
past ten years or so

1158
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I see some of this myself

1159
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
some things i thought about

1160
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
and did something

1161
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
roughly divided into these

1162
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Mainly talking about the 7 years and 4 months in Yangming

1163
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
some of the things i do in medical education

1164
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I said in advance that I did not say

1165
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
mechanism of a disease

1166
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I look at it from the perspective of holistic education

1167
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
The first lecture is the explanation of medical education

1168
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
this is

1169
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Bill Richardson he did it for five years

1170
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I've had four principals in the 28 years I've been there

1171
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
all from outside

1172
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,500
This is a field he does is

1173
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:14,000
Public Policy Public Policy

1174
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,500
After he became the principal, he formed a committee

1175
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:22,000
Examining the Pros and Cons of Hopkins Medical Education

1176
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
he himself is the chairman

1177
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Johns Hobkins School of Medicine in the United States

1178
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,500
is part of the second school of public health

1179
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,500
But he didn't say it because he thought it was the best

1180
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,500
and how about going

1181
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
think that means

1182
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,500
just let him go like this

1183
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,500
He also asked outsiders to come and inspect it for us.

1184
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,500
what can be improved

1185
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,500
He made a lot of conclusions

1186
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,500
One of them I remember very clearly is that

1187
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,500
One of the conclusions is that

1188
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,500
The medical students he trained

1189
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
Don't forget that America is a university

1190
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:56,500
After the fourth year of school, after graduating from university

1191
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,500
is a good course of treatment

1192
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
but not a good course

1193
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Do you understand what this means?

1194
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
That is to say, they may because they have enough knowledge

1195
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So think of the patient's origin as a what

1196
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
an entity

1197
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
One 11 Machines

1198
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
To diagnose what disease a person needs

1199
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Instead of forgetting what his object is

1200
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
is a human disease

1201
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I think what the patient sees

1202
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
eye-to-eye interaction

1203
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It is this I to I contact that is actually very important

1204
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Make you feel sick

1205
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
In fact, they feel that there is a lack of

1206
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
so they made a decision

1207
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
when they recruit students

1208
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Generally, students are recruited when masters

1209
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
after they are students

1210
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
they changed to junior

1211
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
After junior accepts you

1212
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
you are sure to come

1213
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
When he was a master, he encouraged you to seek

1214
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
many humanities courses

1215
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
I hope to cultivate your humanistic quality

1216
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
This is what they do

1217
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
This has a certain degree of influence on me

1218
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
his thinking

1219
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,700
Before I talk about medical education, I want to talk about whole-person education

1220
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,800
why say this

1221
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,500
Because just talking about it in Taiwan is not an afterthought

1222
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
So our medicine is also a university

1223
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,000
Then our university now emphasizes whole-person education

1224
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,200
So it's possible to do both

1225
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,000
i think it's a challenge

1226
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
What is holistic education

1227
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Today I talk about the meaning of university education

1228
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,300
why is it important basically

1229
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,300
It is equivalent to say that the transition from adolescent to adult

1230
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,800
Or from being young and ignorant to being able to enter the society

1231
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,300
Before this one, I think it is an important training

1232
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,300
In fact, in addition to professional

1233
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,300
Be a person and know how to live

1234
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,300
Ability to lead and be led

1235
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,300
In fact, the cultivation of ability is actually very ignorant of knowledge.

1236
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,300
In fact, the cultivation of ability is actually the most important part of university.

1237
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,300
That emphasizes that the scene is whole-person education and Listic Education

1238
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,300
For example, I used to say that at Hopkins

1239
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,800
We are all graduate students in public affairs

1240
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
no university department

1241
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,800
so we don't have a lot of contact

1242
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So I told my boss who is the one who likes mathematics very much

1243
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Everyone, take a look at the two of us. He is also at the University of Washington in Western Asia like me.

1244
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Later, I practiced the same degree in biostatistics only 30 years later.

1245
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
It’s just that everyone has noticed that my doctor’s castle is better than that one

1246
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It is because I decided to return to Taiwan to be the principal

1247
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I bought a very expensive one for this graduation ceremony

1248
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
His rental is very thin

1249
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
But I think I appreciate my older son

1250
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I think we've become very good friends now

1251
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I think he was the same age when he was growing up and he was much more mature than me

1252
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
So at that time I wanted to know more about this holistic education

1253
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'll discuss it with him

1254
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
He studied mathematics for four years

1255
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
He didn't do well in his first or second year because he was in the army in high school

1256
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
He works very hard and gets good grades

1257
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
He participated in many activities when he was a junior

1258
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
In the society as the president of the society

1259
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Apply for that, apply for that Xiebo Proposal

1260
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,400
Fight for funding

1261
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,900
One of their activities is to go to Taiwan

1262
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,000
The kind of parents and children like us

1263
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,600
Huang Tang wants to run that night market

1264
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,000
He writes Presentation like this

1265
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,900
His grades have dropped

1266
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,800
I'll talk to him

1267
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,400
Do you think you will feel a little regretful

1268
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
He will not

1269
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,800
He thinks his experience is very important to me

1270
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,600
Better grades than this school's leave course

1271
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,800
I think that is more important

1272
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,000
this first

1273
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,300
Then when he was four years

1274
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,700
he decided to go

1275
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,000
At that time, what is now called the bubble economy

1276
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,500
That is, financial investment is very popular

1277
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,800
he wants to go into the field

1278
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,100
But he didn't even study economics in college

1279
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,100
nothing class

1280
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:39,900
not repaired

1281
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,000
I happened to be in Taiwan at that time

1282
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,600
I'm in a bank when he comes back

1283
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,900
do an intern

1284
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,000
every day

1285
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,500
But go over there and help pour tea

1286
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,600
Help to set up the projector

1287
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,500
then go back later

1288
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,100
then he applies for a job

1289
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,100
The one called capital one is for that credit card

1290
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,500
That is to go to this field

1291
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,400
go to interview

1292
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,400
This was given to him

1293
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And he got a master's degree in mathematics in the same four years of university

1294
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,700
Give him a salary of 50,000 for five years and give him 60,000

1295
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,100
So we're going to discuss why people give you this

1296
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,800
willing to invest in your

1297
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,900
One I think after all the Happens school has a good reputation

1298
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,800
Probably the students are not too bad

1299
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,000
The second one is good at math

1300
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,900
So he does some analysis inside

1301
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,400
also make predictions

1302
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,100
But I don't think it's the main thing

1303
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,900
I think they also watch your interactions with people

1304
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,800
Also, do you have the ability to acquire new knowledge?

1305
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,700
I want him to share his college experience with him

1306
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,500
I want to impress them with this aspect

1307
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,400
So after I listened to him

1308
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,200
I saw a so-called student education

1309
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,600
bring out a direction

1310
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,300
It's actually very helpful for me

1311
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,000
I say that

1312
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Just mentioned the combination of medical education and university

1313
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,600
because at the same time

1314
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:53,800
So in the process

1315
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
Medical education should emphasize that

1316
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,900
Discussion on the Literacy of the Original Text

1317
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,900
In the future, you still hope that soldier will grow from youth

1318
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,400
Does he have the heart

1319
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,320
and caring between people

1320
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,600
I think it's all very important

1321
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,000
When the other is to be able to find out

1322
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,200
i want any field

1323
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,320
We hope that students can find out their interests

1324
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,800
bring out his former abilities

1325
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,220
So I think these are the most important things in this university

1326
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,640
is where we should be concerned

1327
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,500
Then I'm talking about what I do

1328
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,320
That is to say, everyone, if there are high school classmates here

1329
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,100
think about it

1330
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,140
If you go to study medicine

1331
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,920
In fact, the field is very broad

1332
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,080
he can do clinical work

1333
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,500
The family will make up for the public

1334
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,600
Because the desire for power for the patient

1335
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,640
Medical Education Cultivates Excellent Stamina

1336
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,720
It is also possible to engage in medical research and explore the universe for a salary

1337
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,320
You can also work in health administration in this Ministry of Health and Welfare

1338
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,860
be an administrator

1339
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,980
The chief doctor and division can implement the policies of the members of the congregation

1340
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,060
Of course, it can also improve the level of medical treatment in the biotechnology industry

1341
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,600
So the road is very wide

1342
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,880
a little bit below

1343
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,400
Thanks

1344
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Have you heard of He Wenyong's name?

1345
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Have you ever heard of Luo Dayao's name?

1346
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Both of them studied medicine at university

1347
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
One is Northern Medicine, the other is Chinese Medicine

1348
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
What happened afterwards?

1349
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Because they are writers, because they are musicians

1350
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I see these medical students are very good

1351
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
many talents, one is

1352
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Take a year off to study drama

1353
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I want to encourage them to go down this path

1354
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
It's important that they keep their interest

1355
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Back to this point, no matter what field

1356
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I think a few key concepts

1357
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
To save the motor, we must put the basic

1358
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
call it up

1359
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
The second is to say

1360
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
We want schools to guide them

1361
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Let their interest go out even more

1362
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
find the interest to go inside

1363
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So in my first year

1364
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Yangming City was established in 1975

1365
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I think it was because

1366
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The birth of the National Defense Medical College and Beirong

1367
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
can be established

1368
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
In my first year there, in addition to familiarizing myself with the environment

1369
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Because I looked at each other before

1370
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Very very unfamiliar with Yang Misi

1371
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,500
Also in order to prepare for the application for the five-year 50 billion plan

1372
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,000
I mainly did two things

1373
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The first one is PPL

1374
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
PPL就Problem-based learning

1375
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,500
This is very common in medical education

1376
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,000
Expansion of the content of the case

1377
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Reorganization of Second Foundation Course Confirmation

1378
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I put it on

1379
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,500
PPL course is basically a small class

1380
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Beginning with Harvard University in the United States

1381
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,000
Their small class starts from the third grade and the fourth grade

1382
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,500
about ten people

1383
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,500
what about them every time

1384
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,000
It is based on the organ

1385
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
not a disease

1386
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
it could be the lungs

1387
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
or the kidneys

1388
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,500
Organ as the main axis

1389
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,500
every semester

1390
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,000
they have eight to eleven cases

1391
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,500
Let's discuss each case

1392
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,500
after discussion

1393
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500
be able to learn more about the situation

1394
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,500
then i noticed at that time

1395
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,000
I didn't know these before

1396
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I think they emphasize the mechanism of healing

1397
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Diagnosis and Treatment

1398
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
it's all important

1399
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But I think they overlooked something

1400
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
prevention

1401
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,480
In fact, in terms of training the computer

1402
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,840
They were trained to collect literature

1403
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,940
oral presentation skills

1404
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,540
because of this increase

1405
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,880
But I don't think they

1406
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,340
Put all the precautions in

1407
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,140
So I was at that time

1408
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,940
The Institute of Public Health speaks

1409
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,780
so they spent a year

1410
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,700
Atmospheric discussion about what happened next

1411
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:17,900
put this lesson plan inside

1412
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,240
just add this

1413
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,340
plus prevention

1414
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,040
And there are students involved

1415
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:22,740
i think so

1416
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,640
The whole is more complete

1417
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,440
So I feel very happy

1418
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,080
I want to talk about Yang Ming

1419
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,080
then there are other opportunities

1420
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,080
Go to Yangming and talk about my major

1421
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
So there's a chance this can be used

1422
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,520
basic course planning

1423
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,320
Foundation Course

1424
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,820
Even if it should be the most defensive MENTAL

1425
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,320
should be the most basic

1426
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,080
So then I was in the first year

1427
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,320
Take time with that time to be responsible

1428
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,320
A Highlander Dean of Foundation Studies

1429
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,620
and the provost

1430
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,320
In fact, Xu Wanzhi is the provost

1431
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,520
let's discuss

1432
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,020
Let's first set out what is the basic course

1433
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:57,620
It is mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and information

1434
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,660
Then we set a few principles

1435
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,060
course

1436
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,540
Should be a small team

1437
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,900
Don't forget that there are more than 100 people

1438
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,640
that small team

1439
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,100
In addition, if you teach this physics

1440
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,980
Should be a physical PSD deal

1441
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,100
like my college math

1442
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,940
But I don't think I can teach crisis points anymore.

1443
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,900
because i've been away for too long

1444
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,300
I don't understand some of its flavors

1445
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,540
so be professional

1446
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,240
Then additional advanced courses

1447
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,980
I think young people need to be challenged

1448
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,280
There are options that need to be able to be challenged

1449
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,400
There are many students in it

1450
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,200
High school may have taken the crisis score

1451
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,200
what he needs

1452
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,000
advanced to accept his challenge

1453
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,540
In addition, I think

1454
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,940
There should be experienced teachers

1455
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,400
Because basic courses like this

1456
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,640
It's so easy to lose interest

1457
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,600
to keep you interested

1458
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,240
Even more difficult to generate interest

1459
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,600
So we set these principles

1460
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,100
Then follow along to teach

1461
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,400
like physical words

1462
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
we have photoelectric lock

1463
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,340
and this volunteer

1464
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,800
So many teachers are physics PSD

1465
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,140
chemistry not to mention biochemistry

1466
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,880
they are also

1467
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,040
that math

1468
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,800
Our Yangming Medical University has no Faculty of Science and no Faculty of Engineering

1469
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,900
So then we asked

1470
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:07,700
I found out that Central University is also very good at teaching

1471
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,500
We asked him to teach the wiki score for the medical department

1472
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,100
Later I found out that I was a school girl in Tsinghua University

1473
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,700
Dean of Faculty of Science in Tobu

1474
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,800
I heard that he is very interesting about education

1475
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,800
I'll ask him to be the one who unblocks the Wikipedia

1476
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,300
I share this story with you

1477
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,900
he is willing to come

1478
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,600
He said that because of his general words

1479
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,800
You can work part-time for four hours a week

1480
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,000
But because he can only work as an administrator for two hours

1481
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,500
But he insisted that a moment should be three credits

1482
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,700
I totally agree

1483
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,500
But he only took two credits for this

1484
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,800
the terminal fee

1485
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,400
Yes, he insisted on three credits.

1486
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,500
then he will say

1487
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,200
I probably won't be able to teach in my second term.

1488
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,300
But let me introduce you to a junior to pick me up

1489
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,600
So a year later I asked both of them

1490
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,300
Thank them on the one hand and listen to their thoughts on the other hand

1491
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,700
This is my school girl Zhu Qiping

1492
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,800
He told me that I had already taught his junior not to come

1493
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,600
I want to continue teaching

1494
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,700
Why

1495
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
He's combining Wikipedia with the current book of modern times

1496
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
He said I think I can pay more

1497
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
There can be a lot of room for improvement

1498
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
You know it's a good teacher when you hear it

1499
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
He didn't come here to hang out

1500
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
what he demands of himself

1501
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
The second one, he said to see the student's remark

1502
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Then looked at the students

1503
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Of course, there may be some things that have been said and heard

1504
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
maybe head down

1505
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Raise your head when you talk about something new

1506
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That kind of longing for new knowledge

1507
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Your current teacher must be very

1508
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
He said I will continue to pay

1509
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
i said no problem

1510
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Then your student can come

1511
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Other departments can also submit

1512
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
The result of these two classes

1513
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
The evaluation of the medical department

1514
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
one year is the first

1515
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
one is the first one is the third

1516
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So I use this to talk to that medical teacher

1517
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
don't use this excuse to say

1518
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
These are my benchmark classes

1519
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
he is not interested

1520
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
no

1521
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
In fact, did you pay well?

1522
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
you pay well

1523
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
they will be interested in learning

1524
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
is really very important

1525
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I'm going to talk to some students in the process

1526
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Medical students and medical teachers to explain

1527
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
In the future, our students will be trained as outpatients.

1528
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Why should I learn Vicky Finn

1529
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm going to explain to them I mean the first

1530
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Wikifin mathematics is to train you to analyze

1531
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
The ability to logic is a good way

1532
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
i think no matter what

1533
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I wonder if I have the ability

1534
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's actually very helpful to you

1535
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
The second is also the ability to acquire new knowledge

1536
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
His basis may be to show that you are for you

1537
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You have the ability to acquire new knowledge

1538
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Thirdly, I said that some of the medical department may study medical engineering in the future

1539
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Department of Medical Engineering at Haltor University

1540
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
He taught Lemon Math

1541
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
so i think we did it for a reason

1542
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Later I thought that I also convinced many

1543
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The heads of other departments are all willing to accept this matter

1544
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Simultaneous education

1545
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Going back to what I just said about Dean Harto

1546
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Shaw long Bue Richardson what they do

1547
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I think it's humanistic

1548
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So I also spent a lot of time understanding

1549
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
what a general education course basically is

1550
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
because i see it as a

1551
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It is possible to broaden horizons through this upbringing

1552
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
and the way of dialogue with people

1553
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I think a cornerstone of whole person education

1554
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I think it's very, very important

1555
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
When I was in my third or tenth year

1556
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'm starting to worry about things

1557
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I think it should be changed to three credits

1558
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Two credits are not enough

1559
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It's the Qing court ordering water

1560
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
There is no way to show in-depth

1561
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I think it's three credits

1562
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Give the opportunity to be a middle school student that learns

1563
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Cultivate a concept of secondary school learning

1564
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
a legitimate interest in this

1565
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
so it may take more time in the future

1566
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
invest in this

1567
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Might be a Hobby too

1568
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So at that time, I and a dozen of my medical arts classmates

1569
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Discuss that they agree

1570
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Students, their classes are very heavy

1571
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
they agree

1572
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Then I told the dean of life

1573
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Because the senior teachers are also very supportive

1574
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So at the beginning, I said to teach two courses first.

1575
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
The result is not half done

1576
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I'll explain to you later why it's not half done

1577
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
But my personality I am

1578
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Do not give up

1579
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Let's share with others what we do

1580
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
when to understand the problem

1581
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
The first thing we do is

1582
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
That's the National Science Council

1583
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
The chairperson at that time was Zhu Jingyi

1584
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
He is also the vice president of Zhongyuan

1585
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
He is very familiar with Dean Wen Qiwu

1586
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
He convinced Dean Wen Qiwu

1587
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
That is to say, the Central Plains Institute

1588
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I want Central Plains Humanities

1589
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
The institute decides

1590
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
In fact, the words of the Central Plains

1591
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
In fact, university education

1592
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
many places to invest

1593
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
so they just agree

1594
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
he helped us in congress

1595
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Get a research proposal

1596
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
There are very few such training universities

1597
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
NSC research projects

1598
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
with this

1599
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Twenty researchers

1600
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
with special researcher

1601
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Some academicians opened

1602
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The second course

1603
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
They don't have a second class

1604
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It's a second class

1605
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
we have teaching assistants to assist them

1606
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Then what

1607
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Let us learn to open six doors

1608
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
colleague's course

1609
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
that's when we made a decision

1610
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,500
We also arrange cross-examination for students to come to the House of Representatives

1611
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,500
It's not the easiest way for a teacher to come to our side

1612
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,000
We want students to come to the House

1613
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
This is the highest academic hall in the country

1614
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Let them feel the atmosphere of the House of Representatives

1615
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And it should be Lianjin Publishing House at that time

1616
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
He also said that he hopes to publish textbooks

1617
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
teacher if textbook

1618
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Think about education

1619
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
there really are no good textbooks

1620
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So this is a thing we did

1621
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I think it's a very meaningful thing

1622
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
come back here and talk

1623
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Why did I just say that pushing the three studies failed?

1624
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Because I know Yangming's department

1625
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
There are many departments

1626
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
They are all certificates

1627
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
If you get a certificate, you must do an internship

1628
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
So the practice class is very important

1629
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Caused exclusion of general education and basic courses

1630
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
In fact, at that time, some schools said

1631
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
one day and a half a week

1632
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You want to be empty, you can't line up that other

1633
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
must be general knowledge

1634
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
How do I see it

1635
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
those teachers are sneaking away

1636
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
just plug this

1637
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So the general education class time becomes much less

1638
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
So at that time we said to open two courses

1639
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
two classes

1640
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
what is three credits

1641
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
The third, fourth and fifth quarters are the fifth quarter noon

1642
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
or seven eight nine

1643
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
just what is that

1644
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And finally another class

1645
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It's actually hard to do that

1646
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
so what then

1647
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
understand the problem in this place

1648
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
and hours

1649
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Are there too many classes in this period?

1650
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I asked them that they were actually Mando

1651
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
but i will understand

1652
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
kind of like nursing

1653
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
some of their other private schools

1654
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It was during this period that he was able to tell his parents

1655
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I want to collect your tuition fee

1656
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
is it really necessary

1657
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
not too late

1658
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I remember at that time I was talking to a member of the Examination Institute

1659
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
This examiner is Hu Yupu

1660
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
he also cares

1661
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
He especially once they went on a date

1662
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Went to Yangming to discuss

1663
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I also understand the key

1664
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
professional association

1665
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
They just insist on that many hours

1666
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
just above this period

1667
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
so what do we do then

1668
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I will discuss with President Xi

1669
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
We promote the consistent concept of four plus one five years

1670
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
If it is five years, you can have a double degree

1671
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Just have a master's degree

1672
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
In this case, more than one year

1673
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
can reduce crowding

1674
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Then we also know the students

1675
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
we all our school

1676
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
what we should do propose different options

1677
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
give him a chance to choose

1678
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So we see that there are three different tracks

1679
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
He will probably be willing to go clinical

1680
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Because it may be going round

1681
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
or walk in the health administration's

1682
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
So three different tracks have different courses

1683
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So we make arrangements for this

1684
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
but said a restriction

1685
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Guys, maybe I didn't know at the time

1686
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
The university law says that your knowledge can directly advance to a Ph.D.

1687
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
this is allowed

1688
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Masters can go directly to Ph.D.

1689
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But knowledge cannot lead directly to a master's degree

1690
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
So this is stuck in

1691
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,440
so i can't say when you come in

1692
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,440
let me tell you how

1693
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,940
I just said yes after four years of training

1694
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,840
Come back after you graduate and finish your fifth year

1695
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,840
Then I went to talk to the Minister of Education

1696
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,540
Hope to change university law

1697
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:12,980
I just left after that

1698
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,880
no more

1699
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,140
This means I think

1700
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:18,440
we use this way to change

1701
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,800
In fact there are several

1702
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,740
just a pharmacy

1703
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,140
In foreign countries it is four plus two

1704
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:22,840
this is better

1705
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,900
In six years, I think there will be no crowding out

1706
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:26,900
for technical courses

1707
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,900
exclusion from concurrent courses

1708
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,200
Let's talk about the importance of talent development

1709
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,100
In fact, from a medical background

1710
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,800
Actually working as a doctor in a hospital

1711
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,800
There are also great advantages

1712
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,700
Why

1713
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,700
because he does clinical

1714
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,500
He can interact with patients

1715
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,600
he can look inside

1716
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,800
There are some scientific hypotheses

1717
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,900
there's nothing we can do

1718
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:51,100
we are in the office

1719
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,700
I didn't come into contact with patients

1720
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,100
If there is no one like him, you can identify some

1721
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,200
Some hypocysis that may be important

1722
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,300
because you want to do clinical

1723
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
To be researched, to be patient

1724
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Then he is a doctor, what can he do?

1725
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
to persuade patients to participate

1726
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So it's actually a medical background

1727
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It is very important for flushing

1728
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
When I was in Yangming, I was a labor student

1729
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So after you read it, you have to come

1730
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Six year construction cost

1731
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So after reading, after working hard

1732
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
It's almost thirty years old

1733
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So later, at that time, I seldom went abroad to study

1734
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Then the wages stopped

1735
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So we want to say that they should be encouraged

1736
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Able to walk Bunong Road

1737
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
even go abroad to give birth

1738
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
so thank you so much

1739
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
a kind person

1740
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You may have heard of Mr. Yanliang

1741
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
he is very

1742
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
a very different philanthropist

1743
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
He donated 440 million

1744
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
more than ten years

1745
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
For clinicians in Beirong

1746
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
With Yang Ming's medical students

1747
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
so that they can go abroad for a short time

1748
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
two months

1749
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
In the laboratory of a top university

1750
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
go for an internship , or do a trainee here

1751
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I happened to be at Washington University at the time

1752
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,640
We have arranged for four places

1753
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,340
It is very difficult to let them go

1754
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,280
after they go back

1755
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,140
they share

1756
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,240
since they came back

1757
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,240
they don't complain anymore

1758
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,280
I used to feel very hard

1759
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,280
go over there and see them

1760
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,940
those same medical students

1761
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,040
They worked hard, please read Paper

1762
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,940
Let's read an article this week

1763
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,040
He reads seven articles a week

1764
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,400
and discuss it early

1765
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,200
i want this for them

1766
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,340
is an extension of the entire field of view is helpful

1767
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:27,640
In addition, the long-term term is MD PhD

1768
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,700
We are called Hybrid

1769
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,400
MD is Yangming

1770
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,500
But his Percis in Hopkins

1771
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,600
We can provide another five years

1772
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,200
2 million per year

1773
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,700
let him go out

1774
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:41,900
So now there are many students

1775
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,300
Because it's here to practice Percis

1776
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,400
because i see many students

1777
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,200
is really very interested in research

1778
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,100
Maybe the relationship between his parents wants him to go

1779
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,500
Going to medical school will be fine in the future

1780
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,400
Faculty of medicine can see in the future

1781
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,200
In fact, he said in his heart that it was research

1782
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,300
I think we've given the opportunity

1783
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:56,600
let him go this way

1784
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,500
so i'm going to say

1785
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,900
school whether university high school

1786
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
When we work, we must provide opportunities and challenges

1787
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
let them take up the challenge

1788
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
and then let them put their money to work

1789
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
i did one thing

1790
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
It's the principal Yuan Yue

1791
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
We live in the principal's dormitory

1792
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
that living room is big

1793
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
At that time, we first went to see them and said

1794
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Do you want to separate it to make a suitable

1795
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
we say no

1796
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
i want to say

1797
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Hope to be with my classmates every month

1798
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Our class is far away from the principal

1799
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
the last friday of every month

1800
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Students register online

1801
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
go eat and chat with them

1802
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I want to know more about them from the inside

1803
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I also want them to think about some

1804
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
They may have our own experience abroad

1805
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
share with them

1806
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I am very grateful that my wife is willing to participate together

1807
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
We also because of engaging with students

1808
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
we feel

1809
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I feel younger too

1810
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
because with young people

1811
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So we will be here in the past or seven years

1812
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
we special fifty times

1813
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
from six o'clock in the evening

1814
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
sometimes it talks about twelve o'clock

1815
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Some students are still unsure

1816
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Very

1817
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
very easy to talk to

1818
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
i think the second time

1819
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
One student left first

1820
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,300
I'm already desperate for this school.

1821
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,300
now it seems that means

1822
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,500
what do they want

1823
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,000
would you like to listen

1824
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,800
He also knows what they say

1825
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,700
we may not hit

1826
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,000
but you are willing to listen

1827
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
this is what they want

1828
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,700
And for me it's also learning from each other

1829
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,500
These young people are really good

1830
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:19,300
I think I can learn a lot from them

1831
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,000
And we I want to speak as a

1832
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,200
is to solve the problem together

1833
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,800
It's not about you and us

1834
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,900
I said I don't like listening to your jokes

1835
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,300
no we are one big family

1836
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,900
Let's solve problems together

1837
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,700
I will do a logic here

1838
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,900
It is we who are bound to learn from the light

1839
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:37,600
Then if the teachers in our own school

1840
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,600
including the principal

1841
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,400
not to make him feel that you care about them

1842
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,000
How do you learn to care for your own patients from them?

1843
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,200
So I think our Yangming's actually

1844
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,200
Now it should be Yangming Jiaotong University

1845
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,300
I was still Yangming

1846
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,900
so i got used to calling it

1847
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,200
Yang Ming's Mentor Production Department did a really good job

1848
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,000
then i didn't participate

1849
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,500
But I use this way

1850
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,700
I use this interaction between principals and students

1851
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:57,700
i just say by the way

1852
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,800
I think I saw the old man talking to young people

1853
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
In fact, mentors and luggage IQ are very important

1854
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
they all need this

1855
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Now this entire video expansion tube

1856
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Then there are many choices, but sometimes you will be confused

1857
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
need us to care about them

1858
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I think this part is actually very important to me.

1859
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I have a lot of stories to share with you

1860
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I want to talk about

1861
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Today at National Taiwan University

1862
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Of course this administrative job

1863
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I want to share a few thoughts I saw

1864
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
The first one is medical and neutral universities

1865
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I'll talk about why I said it later

1866
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
In fact, in the United States or Europe

1867
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
A good neutral university

1868
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
is good medicine is a positive correlation

1869
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
like harvard on the east coast

1870
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Harpkins Yale West Denver

1871
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Duke of the East China Sea and the University of Washington

1872
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
they both have medical schools

1873
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
So to improve SCI

1874
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Then follow the high ranking

1875
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Actually this was in 2010

1876
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Mainland China does this

1877
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
This is a combination of swarm universities and medical universities

1878
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Combination of Peking University and Beijing Medical University

1879
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
become a university

1880
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
That's mainly to say that it looks like this

1881
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Because the medical ranking score SCI is relatively high

1882
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
This allows for ranking comparisons

1883
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Then I think this is entirely caused by the cause and effect

1884
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
not for this reason

1885
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
but because medicine can play

1886
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Much like a bridging or bridging role

1887
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It can be set up with different people

1888
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
engineering management mathematics

1889
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Let's take an example

1890
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
medical humanities

1891
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
medical engineering

1892
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
hospital management

1893
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
biochemistry etc.

1894
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
In fact, medicine can play

1895
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,000
very important role

1896
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
So I think a Chinese Arts University

1897
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
able to lift up

1898
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
this is very important

1899
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I will tell you this is what you have seen recently

1900
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That is to say, how many universities

1901
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Including Xinhua University

1902
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
is my alma mater

1903
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
The medicine they established

1904
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I know the medical community is very sensitive to this

1905
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
have different voices

1906
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
think they are from this

1907
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
buckle his point of view

1908
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
But I don't look at it from this angle

1909
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
i am from a university

1910
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,500
Because if China Camp University can go up

1911
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,500
I have medical school that will play a big role

1912
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:09,000
So I really support them in establishing this medical school.

1913
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,500
The Department of Medicine should be the Department of Post-Medical Medicine

1914
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,500
The myth of the research university

1915
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,500
What about research universities?

1916
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,500
It is a mission that focuses on cultivating research talents

1917
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,500
It emphasizes knowledge discovery

1918
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:27,500
Unlike other universities in general are called

1919
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Knowledge transmission is provided to students

1920
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
In fact, with American personnel

1921
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,700
America's major Harvard

1922
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:38,500
Princeton was originally following the British system

1923
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,500
It is knowledge transmission

1924
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:45,500
Founded in 191876 at Harp Kern

1925
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:50,500
At this time, they sent a group to Germany to learn Buddhist scriptures.

1926
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:54,500
They are studying the German model is knowledge discovery

1927
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,500
So it is the first research university in the United States

1928
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,500
this book is that

1929
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,300
Vice President of Columbia University

1930
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,840
what he writes is what he tells

1931
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,700
A look at the impact of research universities on the United States

1932
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,140
found that in fact

1933
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:11,900
Improve human health

1934
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:13,440
quality of life with great attention

1935
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,900
possible school studies

1936
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,640
After industrial integration

1937
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,040
to the whole health

1938
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,800
such as health insurance

1939
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,200
That Health System

1940
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,700
wait there are new drugs

1941
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,740
Actually plays a very important role

1942
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,500
OK

1943
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,340
I'm going to say that

1944
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:28,000
research university

1945
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,600
as the main field

1946
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,000
But this is different from the general university education.

1947
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
objects are different

1948
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,400
A Holistic Education and Professional Education

1949
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,800
the two are different

1950
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
it takes time

1951
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,600
i will say it

1952
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,800
I see domestic

1953
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,700
Many of our research universities now

1954
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,200
even use this excuse all the time

1955
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,800
I am a graduate university says

1956
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:50,600
I just do research

1957
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,800
so teaching is secondary

1958
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,400
It's definitely an excuse

1959
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,300
I think it's completely a matter of cause and effect

1960
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,800
research-based education

1961
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,500
The counter-responsibility of education is heavier

1962
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,200
because at that time

1963
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
School education Talents cultivated

1964
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
The purpose is different from the purpose of the talents cultivated by the research institute

1965
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
So that means you should put more effort into it

1966
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I was in Hawkins for 28 years

1967
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
America's No. 1 Research University

1968
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
i never felt say

1969
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
We are a research university so teaching is not important

1970
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
we need to spend a lot of energy

1971
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I am in charge of Gradure Program Director

1972
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
A new course designed with a lot of effort

1973
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
To train well and attract good students

1974
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
In this regard, I think that in our country

1975
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I think there are still many places that need to be reviewed.

1976
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The third is the opinion of the guests of Taiwan Higher Education

1977
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
This is my personal opinion, just listen to it

1978
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
I want everyone to talk about the challenges of higher education in Taiwan

1979
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I think it's natural to think of declining birth rate

1980
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Too many universities, not enough money

1981
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
It's not easy to recruit and follow, it's a fact

1982
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
But I think the more important question

1983
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
It should be more than this

1984
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I think it's false equality

1985
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,840
Everyone has the funds for military battles

1986
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,940
In fact, many things are not false equality

1987
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,200
That false equality is instead a

1988
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,540
everyone lost

1989
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,440
In addition to that

1990
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,480
In fact, there are so many schools in Taiwan

1991
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:15,280
In fact, there are three different

1992
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,240
One research type and one technical type

1993
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,280
one is teaching

1994
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,480
Like Feng Jia, Donghai, Dongwu, etc.

1995
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,380
They cultivate different talents

1996
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,580
Cultivation is the middle element of society

1997
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,080
You are the so-called Libro in the United States

1998
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,080
It's actually different

1999
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,680
I think before

2000
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,580
There are different research funding

2001
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,580
Because their missions are different

2002
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:34,820
There are different research mechanisms

2003
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,320
Different indicators are right

2004
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,120
Then about seven or eight years ago

2005
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,080
get this deep root plan

2006
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:44,320
I think it becomes a big pot of rice

2007
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,020
break it all up

2008
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:51,760
I think this is a very wrong idea

2009
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,120
then we went for it

2010
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,320
Later, at that time, we talked about research-type

2011
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,320
these three words

2012
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,560
Or top universities can't use it

2013
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,060
because it hurts other people's feelings

2014
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,440
I think it's a false fair idea

2015
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,080
an attitude of

2016
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,440
Also I think it's the whole process

2017
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,000
Many do not have very long-term plans

2018
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,880
first aid

2019
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:09,940
did not think carefully

2020
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:11,740
Just put out a policy

2021
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,340
Of course, I also think it is very important

2022
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,140
It is the maintenance of the University's autonomy

2023
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:18,000
A few years ago, I saw that National Taiwan University was elected

2024
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,200
I think that's pretty clear

2025
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,800
is to see a political intervention

2026
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,940
Recently, National Taiwan University plagiarized

2027
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:26,140
So I think

2028
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,680
i see it

2029
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,780
They held at least this time

2030
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:33,360
Just be sure to be the media

2031
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,420
what that or the official

2032
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:36,680
Various people say they are holding on

2033
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,580
things to do

2034
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,120
maintenance of the maintenance

2035
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:43,280
I think this is actually a very, very important thing

2036
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,380
ok finally i want to talk

2037
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:48,980
our heterotopic domain

2038
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:49,980
some future trends

2039
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:51,080
I want to make two points

2040
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,480
One is precision health and well-being for the whole people

2041
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,280
A remote and smart medical care

2042
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,480
This may have something to do with all of you to a certain extent.

2043
01:18:59,480 --> 01:18:59,980
general health

2044
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,840
The scene means that now we see not only Taiwan

2045
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,640
This trend exists in many countries

2046
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,440
Reasons for a super-aged society

2047
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,400
Chronic diseases trigger continuous growth of health insurance benefits

2048
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:11,900
right now we

2049
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,640
I think it was our ten or twenty years ago

2050
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,240
The so-called 400 billion is now 800 billion

2051
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:19,000
birth rate continues to decline

2052
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:22,740
This means you look at it

2053
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,140
2010 2023

2054
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,040
This one in Taiwan is male and female

2055
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,700
what about people over sixty five

2056
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:31,600
increase in agglomeration

2057
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,700
It has now reached this has been more than sixteen

2058
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,100
percent in 2025

2059
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,800
The likely prediction is 20 percent

2060
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,600
That's the so-called super-aged society

2061
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,100
What do you guys see?

2062
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,200
Ten years after 2008 2018

2063
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,400
Our Taiwan Mortality

2064
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:48,300
Cancer Remains High

2065
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,100
what is the second

2066
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,200
Cardiovascular

2067
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,260
Hadids

2068
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,800
If you look at cancer

2069
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,600
He can be said to be twenty-eight

2070
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,600
Twenty-eight two percent of the past lives are cancer

2071
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,800
And what about health insurance payments?

2072
01:19:58,800 --> 01:19:59,900
that's not one sixth

2073
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Taiwan's birth rate has been falling

2074
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,000
From 1995 to now

2075
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
At that time, there were 15 out of 1000

2076
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Reality becomes 7.7

2077
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
not only

2078
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
this is more exciting

2079
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
how have we started

2080
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Deputy growth

2081
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
It was last year. How has it been since the year before?

2082
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
The number of deaths and the number of births have crossed

2083
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
The number of births is lower than the number of deaths

2084
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I just said this

2085
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
so already started

2086
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
This is the death toll

2087
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
with that number of births

2088
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
what about this

2089
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
This means that

2090
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Decreasing birth rate and aging population are more obvious

2091
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
So maybe by that 2070

2092
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
so the han award is early

2093
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Actually it's not that early

2094
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
what about that time

2095
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
young adults may be in

2096
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,600
so mirage so an old man

2097
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,560
may not be enough people to go

2098
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,000
It's his problem to raise

2099
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,400
so this is us

2100
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,560
I want to confront him with serious questions

2101
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,760
i don't think i have time today

2102
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,200
I just want to say that our countrymen

2103
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,000
Doing a Wei Fu think tank

2104
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,360
we propose the idea

2105
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,960
Precision Health

2106
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,000
not just medical

2107
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,360
medicine machine is a piece

2108
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,400
this is all soul

2109
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:25,760
From child to adult to adult

2110
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,960
prevent from that

2111
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,160
really preventive diagnosis

2112
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,720
Early diagnosis, treatment and care

2113
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,680
With this Digital Health

2114
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,720
with different high-tech

2115
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:36,880
There are also different fields

2116
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,920
may be at home

2117
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,720
may also be at the clinic

2118
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:40,880
or a different hospital

2119
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,760
How do I hope to provide

2120
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:45,280
more precise care

2121
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,160
here is a talk

2122
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:52,160
if you start earlier now

2123
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:52,680
how can i

2124
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:57,080
His medical cost will drop

2125
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,280
The later the start, the easier it is to rise

2126
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,080
Also not

2127
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,540
do it later

2128
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:05,380
The likelihood of this incurable disease also increases

2129
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,680
So I think this emphasizes this concept of prevention

2130
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,640
and how

2131
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:09,980
the sooner you start the better

2132
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:11,780
Future Trends

2133
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,600
I think long-distance and smart medical care are a piece

2134
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,780
the cause and effect

2135
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,180
I think it's because Chen Xiang gap is a

2136
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,500
The doctor did not check

2137
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,400
The Chen Xiang gap in Taiwan is actually quite large.

2138
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,840
still a serious matter

2139
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,880
Of course, with the development of high technology

2140
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,840
And so even that COVID-19

2141
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:30,280
this zero touch

2142
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:33,040
For example, my doctor doesn't want to interact with patients.

2143
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,080
an extension of the concept

2144
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,540
So there is this distance and wisdom

2145
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:38,540
from this side

2146
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:40,440
So shorten the Chen Xiang gap

2147
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,580
Accurate and personalized medical care can be implemented

2148
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,580
Can reduce the risk of infection

2149
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,280
But I think many things are two sides of the same coin

2150
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:48,780
I think we're saying don't forget

2151
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,440
Will this be the loss of this soldier game?

2152
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,080
I guess I don't know if you guys say

2153
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,740
I'm going to see a doctor and if I talk to him

2154
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:57,640
This face to face he and I are very

2155
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:58,740
very common tell me

2156
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,040
I might be better off with a doctor

2157
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,600
I don't think this kind of atmosphere can be replaced in a long distance

2158
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,000
As I just said I do I contact

2159
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,600
And if you are not careful, what will happen to cause the gap between rich and poor to widen?

2160
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,800
Because these rely on a lot of high-tech words

2161
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,400
We prefer whether the local area already has the capability of 5G

2162
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,600
So many things are two sides of the same coin

2163
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,600
this is an example

2164
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:28,600
What our State Council recommends is that there are still Miaoli and Taitung in South Australia.

2165
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
What are the first two points?

2166
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,200
Yes, that old man is also good

2167
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,400
What kind of sickness did you go to the health center?

2168
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,400
And then maybe by Bidong Medical Center

2169
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,400
Then travel a long distance to help him diagnose and treat him.

2170
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,800
We are providing a medical car in Taitung

2171
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,000
to his home to provide this service

2172
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,400
This may be a very important trend in the future.

2173
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,400
Finally, I think what I just said

2174
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,800
I know a lot of young people here

2175
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,800
I am here

2176
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I left Yangming six years ago

2177
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,480
Before, of course, the principal had this support at the graduation ceremony.

2178
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,000
In 2008

2179
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,440
because i left first

2180
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,800
so i have facebook

2181
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,600
I have Facebook to share with the outside world after graduation

2182
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,080
So I'm here to share with you

2183
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,080
I remind them that a humble

2184
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,400
I see a lot of young people are often like that

2185
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,880
Pride South Center

2186
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,320
Selfishness is often one's own worst enemy

2187
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,920
I see them because they are all excellent

2188
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,480
so the world is playing let them go

2189
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,480
not us playing let the world go

2190
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,360
Also I think a self star is very important

2191
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,220
Often the line between cleverness and wisdom

2192
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:43,560
i see too many smart people coming

2193
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,360
in Hobbkin

2194
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,160
You see teachers and students are very smart

2195
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,480
Back to Taiwan too

2196
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,580
But when I saw some, he stopped to a certain extent.

2197
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,480
Because I don't think they can

2198
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,020
He's smart and useless

2199
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,920
Instead it becomes a misuse

2200
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,520
He starred because of lack of ego

2201
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,020
This is actually the self star

2202
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,600
so-called wise man

2203
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,920
Positive thinking

2204
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,500
Often a motivated crew

2205
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,560
i am in America

2206
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,680
habken is the one

2207
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,000
The host of the drama I went to along the South

2208
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,400
He did not do a good job in research

2209
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,400
But the flying boobs are huge

2210
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,140
He sees things as positive

2211
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,140
For example, look at

2212
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:14,940
he likes to drink

2213
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,280
like a glass of wine

2214
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,340
If it is full

2215
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,840
Look at what the positive people say

2216
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:19,640
half full

2217
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:21,580
half empty when you say negative

2218
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,540
totally depends on how you look at things

2219
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,320
then i think he gave me

2220
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,220
this is great for me

2221
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,420
When I arrive at Yangming

2222
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,580
when some colleagues look at me

2223
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,420
as if you see things head on

2224
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:31,380
I actually believe I've been greatly influenced by

2225
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,920
rather than being caught by a kind of thing

2226
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:33,620
think over there

2227
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:35,920
you can't fix that's a

2228
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,160
negative energy

2229
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:37,860
For you

2230
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:40,160
It's not good for your surroundings

2231
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,300
dare to try

2232
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:42,700
don't be afraid to fail

2233
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,560
Because this is the one I invited Hou Wenyong to give a speech

2234
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,160
He just wants to try his dream

2235
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,740
If he hadn't made a decision

2236
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,260
he is willing to invest

2237
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:53,600
he was just thinking

2238
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:54,980
if i do in the future

2239
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,080
how

2240
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,380
There is another meaning here

2241
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:58,580
Dare to try

2242
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,400
Now at Yang Ming Club we will give the results

2243
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,000
there are

2244
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,760
Both are 78 points

2245
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,600
90 cents what?

2246
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,700
I later changed it to ABC

2247
01:26:09,700 --> 01:26:11,700
Because we're not as emphatic as they are

2248
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,800
These things

2249
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,840
that time that

2250
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,700
What's the difference of 0.5 points?

2251
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,000
what am i lower than you

2252
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,200
because that's what you do

2253
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,600
Of course you don't imagine seeing

2254
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,100
become

2255
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,800
during my exam

2256
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,900
I dare not write

2257
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,700
I'm afraid of being wrong

2258
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,000
what happens in this situation

2259
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,700
Unknowingly put your model

2260
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,400
That creativity will be frosted away

2261
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,700
unwilling to try

2262
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:34,400
just think about this

2263
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,200
may not be right

2264
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,200
I am

2265
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,200
my own thoughts

2266
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,500
Write down my Feelings

2267
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,700
so i tried this

2268
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:41,800
i think it should be

2269
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,900
Especially Nation is helpful

2270
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,900
During the past few years at the State Department

2271
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,400
I think these two are speaking to me

2272
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,800
deep understanding

2273
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,400
The State Department says a mission-oriented

2274
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,800
We have a lot of contact with the government

2275
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,100
Then I think it's a bit of reluctance

2276
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,500
never give up

2277
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,900
Often the thin line between success and failure

2278
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Our last year we were fighting for a special budget

2279
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
that would have been

2280
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,000
what we strive for

2281
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
There are applications for three days on May 1st

2282
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
I was later told that we were not

2283
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I will not give up

2284
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
so I

2285
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I will follow

2286
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Director of Correlationism

2287
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
then explain to them

2288
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
why i don't help

2289
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
The result is won

2290
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
i won't do it

2291
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
none of us do

2292
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
just accepted

2293
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
just no

2294
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Here is an example

2295
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I think as long as you think it's right

2296
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Try your best

2297
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,000
something at the end

2298
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
It's not about the result, it's about the process

2299
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
In fact, none of them are you Try your best

2300
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
you have become your best

2301
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
you have a clear conscience

2302
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I want to share this with you guys

2303
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Encourage each other

2304
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
in the end i thought

2305
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I think it is very

2306
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
is to treat people with sincerity

2307
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
This bag is honest and sincere and you are honest

2308
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
often mutual trust

2309
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
The cornerstone of mutual trust

2310
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Over the years I have been involved in many

2311
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
The vaccine during this epidemic

2312
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
what to negotiate with foreign countries

2313
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Including going to OEM and

2314
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
that pre-purchase

2315
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I feel great

2316
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
The one with AZ

2317
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,400
We never knew an Englishman at all

2318
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,600
we build trust

2319
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,900
Then he took the initiative to let me know many things

2320
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,200
Then it can actually help us a lot

2321
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,100
So I said I completely believe in this mutual trust

2322
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,900
It's very, very important to build

2323
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:14,600
as long as you are sincere

2324
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,000
make people feel that you are sincere

2325
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,100
can do it

2326
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,500
so a conclusion

2327
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:22,500
I'm at Tim today from math to medicine

2328
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,200
I want to lay the foundation stone of mathematics

2329
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:25,100
actually very important

2330
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,200
But don't and don't encourage

2331
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,000
This thing has to be done step by step

2332
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,700
This laid foundation is a stone

2333
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,600
a tree stacked it

2334
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,900
Of course mathematics leads to scientific application

2335
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,500
Be sure to take it step by step

2336
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,800
I still believe that mathematics is the mother of science

2337
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:45,200
If the application of mathematics can be used in different fields

2338
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,400
That often doesn't mean

2339
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:49,000
just jump in

2340
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
take time

2341
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,600
like i spend time

2342
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,700
my vision for this

2343
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:54,900
so i'm in hacker

2344
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,200
I am most to blame

2345
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,100
There are two half days in each week

2346
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,900
one is the spirit of discussion

2347
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
It's their genetic research on April 4th

2348
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,300
we all discuss

2349
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:04,500
read the paper together

2350
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:08,000
So my clinical and genetic review of April 4th

2351
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,400
I actually have a certain degree of knowledge in this area

2352
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,000
because we all discuss

2353
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
and step by step

2354
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
then go back to college

2355
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I think it is the inevitable mission of the university to cultivate talents like

2356
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,200
The key to attaching importance to medical education and keeping pace with reality

2357
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,000
I'm talking about, for example, we are now

2358
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
In the past, I think that medical education emphasizes on cultivating

2359
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Right in the hospital is the disease called Q

2360
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,500
Actually now it's like an old man fell and broke his hip

2361
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,000
The hospital mobilized for surgery, that was a start

2362
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:45,500
Is there a community that can assist him before returning home?

2363
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:49,000
be able to rehab be able to get back to yourself

2364
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,500
It's actually a whole set

2365
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:55,000
And university teaching, I think medical teaching also needs to be revised.

2366
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
In response to future trends, there is an urgent need to be located in the pet mother

2367
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
we need to be able to understand

2368
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
It is what we observe that we need to look forward

2369
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
What is the one that will appear?

2370
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
advance deployment etc.

2371
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It's what we want to see, should we wait until the end

2372
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
that was too late

2373
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
The last thing I want to talk about is the routine teaching teacher township head

2374
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Never forget the original intention

2375
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I just mentioned that I see a lot of college teachers

2376
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
The research teacher thinks that I have to do research

2377
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And forget that the main purpose of the university is to cultivate talents

2378
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
don't use that as an excuse

2379
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And Dang is not willing to spend time with students

2380
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
including one for teaching and one for education

2381
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
the two are different

2382
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Education includes some courses that I set up

2383
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
some specifications

2384
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Teaching is that this course can arouse students' interest

2385
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Then I think everyone must not forget

2386
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
This is the original intention of our university

2387
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
thank you all

2388
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Thanks

2389
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Academician Liang Principal Liang Principal Liang

2390
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Very informative and very moving speech

2391
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
So now is the time for you to ask questions

2392
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
we have prepared some gifts

2393
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Thank you, Dean Liang, for his wonderful speech

2394
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Let me start off by saying that I really want that

2395
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Academician Liang has the opportunity to be our Minister of Education

2396
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Minister of Health and Welfare, even better, he is the blessing of Taiwan

2397
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,000
So my question, a lot of questions, but I'll start with one or two

2398
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
that is

2399
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
From a logical point of view, it is

2400
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Medicine, as far as we know about Taiwan

2401
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
doctors can make a lot of money

2402
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
That's great. It can cure your illness.

2403
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
From the point of view of prevention

2404
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Everyone is healthy and they have no money to make

2405
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
So what? I guess it's an institutional issue.

2406
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
how about the system

2407
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
design can go to boot

2408
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Guidance is that doctors are willing

2409
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Let's start with the management of the hospital

2410
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
wish you good health

2411
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
instead of wishing you sick

2412
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
But if it's very powerful, help you heal

2413
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
right

2414
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
This is the first question

2415
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I'll be the first

2416
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
good

2417
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I just proposed to Vice President Liu

2418
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
just after finishing talking

2419
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
i am more than happy to stay

2420
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
tell everyone if

2421
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,000
some problems

2422
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
because time is still limited

2423
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
so or say

2424
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
ask each one

2425
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
or up to two topics

2426
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
If needed

2427
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,000
if there is more

2428
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
we can talk again

2429
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,000
i just asked so consistent

2430
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
very real problem

2431
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
preventive mechanism

2432
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
i may be to the doctor

2433
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Then I don't have a job

2434
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
what to do

2435
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
i think

2436
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
this is impossible

2437
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
there is no single answer

2438
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I think I can think of these two

2439
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
One is in the health insurance payment

2440
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Actually we didn't do it

2441
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
That is to say, it can encourage hygiene

2442
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
If you do good hygiene

2443
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Tell him smoking is bad for David

2444
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Then you can also pay

2445
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,000
This is a

2446
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
i understand did

2447
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
But it's very unreliable

2448
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,000
no effect

2449
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Here is an example

2450
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
I think it can be done this way

2451
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
let there be an incentive to make them work

2452
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
In addition, I think it is humanistic

2453
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Do you want to forget you no matter what

2454
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Are you part of society?

2455
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
whether you are a doctor

2456
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,000
You are a construction worker in the workplace

2457
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
They're all part of society, right?

2458
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Yes or no

2459
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
That should be seen from the whole big letter

2460
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
don't just look at yourself

2461
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
If you have such a mind

2462
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
will do it

2463
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
then we'll be forever

2464
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
It is the institution that built the insurance

2465
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
keep eating it

2466
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I'm wondering now

2467
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
these points

2468
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
But I have come into contact with many

2469
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Actually there are

2470
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
i'm happy to be there

2471
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Yang Ming more than seven years

2472
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
interact with many students

2473
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I'm glad to see

2474
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Many people go to the field of public health

2475
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,000
build that health system up

2476
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
i think i think there is hope

2477
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
good

2478
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,380
if there is still a problem

2479
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,160
after we finish the speech

2480
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:08,080
It's the lady behind the raised hand

2481
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,280
Good evening

2482
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,080
To my understanding

2483
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,500
Education today

2484
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:22,380
seems to focus on the pedagogical side

2485
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:23,880
and

2486
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,080
it seems to me that

2487
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,080
they go more for

2488
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,340
what comes afterwards on mercenary

2489
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:37,120
grounds than the knowledge level

2490
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,520
So how do you try to improve on that

2491
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,840
especially in countries like

2492
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,020
in Asia

2493
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,720
I mean the part of you say

2494
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,020
it seems to emphasize more on

2495
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:51,080
pedagogical the teaching side

2496
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:52,080
Okay

2497
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,020
You want me to

2498
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:56,100
� straight

2499
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,780
deinen can't speak Mandarin

2500
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,180
you

2501
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,860
ok you use yours

2502
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:03,220
Kenyuan

2503
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:05,720
Then I think I can use Chinese

2504
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,220
so that we can compare

2505
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:11,160
I don't think it's just medicine now

2506
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:16,000
It is no longer possible to rely solely on traditional teaching methods

2507
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:20,720
So in fact for Kenya all kinds of different

2508
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,520
Like PBL, I just mentioned that Problem-based learning is a way

2509
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:26,160
just totally unconventional

2510
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,920
it's in a room

2511
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:28,880
just a table

2512
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,680
Then there is a blackboard for everyone to discuss

2513
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:33,780
That is to say, this interactive

2514
01:35:33,780 --> 01:35:36,020
This way is actually very important

2515
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,180
Instead of tradition is teaching one

2516
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:40,320
is one to many

2517
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,320
this is very important

2518
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,180
So I think everyone needs to change this concept.

2519
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:48,320
it is possible to do

2520
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,180
again at the same time

2521
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:51,180
I also want to say by the way

2522
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,180
That is to say, what we often hear is Mux

2523
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,480
have you heard this

2524
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:56,680
what is that called

2525
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,640
just record it first

2526
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,440
Is it called Mux

2527
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,040
what is Chinese

2528
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Do you know what I'm talking about?

2529
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
The teacher may record it first

2530
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
a lesson

2531
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
a course

2532
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Then you can provide

2533
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
i think

2534
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
This is an example

2535
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
we use high tech

2536
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
But don't be high tech

2537
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
driven by high tech

2538
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
You have to use take advantage

2539
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
high tech can offer to you

2540
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
but not the other way around

2541
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
because i feel like that mox

2542
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
for its what's advantage of having a mox

2543
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
是 for those who

2544
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
for those who may not

2545
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
he might not be that better

2546
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
well prepared

2547
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
see before

2548
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
watch this video

2549
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
or see it later

2550
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
unforcement

2551
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
is helpful

2552
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
but not replacement

2553
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
especially in medical education

2554
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
I am I to I context

2555
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
interactive

2556
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
this conversation

2557
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
then i will

2558
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
the whole introduction

2559
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,240
conversation to me

2560
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Well, Dean Liang, thank you

2561
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
you first

2562
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Dean Liang, thank you, the police have spoken

2563
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I want to ask you is

2564
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
You mentioned several times in your speech

2565
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
It's about research

2566
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
i want to ask

2567
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
As a researcher

2568
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
the most important thing is

2569
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Except that he loves his own research

2570
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
This topic also has maintain

2571
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,000
other than his interest

2572
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
usually required to have

2573
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:32,000
other traits or something

2574
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
During your teaching career

2575
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I am

2576
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I can say that the most important thing is

2577
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
find interest

2578
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
we were

2579
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I was before going abroad

2580
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,000
How many years ago did that go abroad

2581
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Before 1974 and 1954

2582
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
At that time it was computer science

2583
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
most popular time

2584
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
many people go out

2585
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
No matter what I read, I read computer

2586
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
work early

2587
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,000
but i think again

2588
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
After he finds someone to work

2589
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
his every day

2590
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
can he

2591
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Are they happy?

2592
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
is he doing what he wants to do

2593
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
So I think interest is very important

2594
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I just mentioned our field

2595
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I can go to work in a pharmaceutical factory

2596
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
I choose to do this

2597
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
because I am interested in research

2598
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
But don't think I'm like this

2599
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I said don't go to the drug factory

2600
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Actually, I was thinking later

2601
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
people who work in a pharmaceutical factory

2602
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
He actually contributed more directly to mankind than us

2603
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Because working with Condition

2604
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
develop a new drug

2605
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
so

2606
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
everyone does different things

2607
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
but no matter what

2608
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
find out what your interests are

2609
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I think it's the most important

2610
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
that interest can be cultivated

2611
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
that can go first

2612
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
So be sure to open mind

2613
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
to understand

2614
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
no presupposition

2615
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:42,000
then talk to different

2616
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
can arouse your interest

2617
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
that interest is important

2618
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
then the second

2619
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
i would actually like

2620
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I think this some mentality

2621
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
that is to say

2622
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
that's easy to say

2623
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
means don't be afraid to fail

2624
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
as i just said

2625
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
we must

2626
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,000
We all go through setbacks

2627
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I asked Vice President Liu

2628
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
well done

2629
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
I think it must be in the middle

2630
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
I also encountered this time

2631
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,320
this paperberryjack these

2632
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,880
But as long as you feel that what you want to do

2633
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,480
to pursue

2634
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,480
At the same time, we must open mind

2635
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,320
to discuss with different people

2636
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,000
I just said that the head of my department

2637
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,080
He obviously didn't do it

2638
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,400
But he is a very good mentor

2639
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,880
Like when I wrote the first grant

2640
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,520
write it out to others

2641
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:26,400
I send that to NH

2642
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,760
Actually what is that title?

2643
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,480
He listens to me

2644
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,040
He gave me a good title

2645
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,040
Then we write paper

2646
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,760
If some comments

2647
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:35,680
i don't know how to respond

2648
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,720
he gave me good answers

2649
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,080
So mentoring is actually very important

2650
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,600
i think some young people

2651
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,040
This is also what I think in the senior

2652
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:43,480
we are going to roleplay

2653
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,960
one unit

2654
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:46,240
if you wish him well

2655
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:48,280
you want him young to get up

2656
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,360
So our role is to develop young people

2657
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:54,400
So I was influenced by the head of the department

2658
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,760
So I'm more experienced

2659
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,640
i play this role

2660
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,560
I mentor young people

2661
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,560
only two left

2662
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,600
I happen twice

2663
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:07,400
The two of them started their business and can take PSC students

2664
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,000
Don't think you can be a professor

2665
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,200
you are still in the old time

2666
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,200
So I see students looking for me

2667
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:16,000
Because I am now a senior and I have this reply

2668
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,200
I just said I'm coming with this one

2669
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,200
supervised you

2670
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,400
I'm going to take her as your manufacturing professor

2671
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:27,800
Throughout the process I wanted to take

2672
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,000
In the beginning we brought together

2673
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,200
I provide her with reference on how I can interact with students

2674
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,600
I will ment her again

2675
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,400
Then the first person asked the student what happened afterwards.

2676
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,600
he published articles

2677
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,400
My colleague asked me why I wanted to help co-author

2678
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:44,700
I still think of what my professor said at the time

2679
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:46,200
I'm not involved

2680
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,800
i don't want

2681
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:51,400
the first young professor

2682
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,400
Now the head of the department

2683
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:55,600
I think it's the other way around

2684
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,900
I encourage each other with senior people

2685
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:59,900
Have the heart to be willing to train young people

2686
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,500
Young people must have a heart

2687
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:03,100
feel nothing

2688
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:06,600
Didn't say it was an ugly question

2689
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,100
It seems that I feel very shameless

2690
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,600
no such thing

2691
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:11,900
Would you like to go to Open Mind

2692
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,400
to ask different questions

2693
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:17,100
The other is to participate in Seminars in different fields

2694
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:19,000
Don't just cling to your lab

2695
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,800
or your institute

2696
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,400
hear some other fields

2697
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,300
good to know

2698
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,900
Only your vision will collapse

2699
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:28,600
Maybe one day because of listening to him

2700
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,800
This handles bypassing

2701
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:34,100
Therefore, the two sides can cooperate better

2702
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:35,400
time relationship we are now

2703
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:41,400
last question

2704
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:44,000
Maybe the microphone must be on

2705
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,960
Is there anything

2706
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:46,700
What statistical software are you familiar with?

2707
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:48,900
Or learn about business databases

2708
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:51,500
An environment that allows you to avoid chest risks

2709
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,000
Then genes live younger

2710
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,300
what environment to avoid

2711
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,500
dangerous environment

2712
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:57,900
chest risk

2713
01:41:57,900 --> 01:41:59,300
chest risk

2714
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
that is...

2715
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
very advanced environment

2716
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
very advanced environment

2717
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
blood in blood

2718
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Danger

2719
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
dangerous environment

2720
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
i context i have nothing

2721
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
that is

2722
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
avoid here

2723
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
let's talk once

2724
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Are you familiar with any statistical software?

2725
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
or business database

2726
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
A bloody environment can be avoided

2727
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Then genes live younger

2728
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
live younger

2729
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
actually

2730
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Taiwan now

2731
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
In recent years the government has promoted

2732
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Health big data integration platform

2733
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
is to put different

2734
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
big data combined

2735
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Not just health insurance information

2736
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
like that

2737
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
they also have that

2738
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
our cloud

2739
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
take that imaging

2740
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
can all be put together

2741
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Now just more and more

2742
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
if put together

2743
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
has been more and more

2744
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
more and more

2745
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I will be more prosperous

2746
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
but i think it is

2747
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I don't know if I have

2748
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
answer you like this

2749
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I said young

2750
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I think it's new

2751
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I just said that our principal has an appointment

2752
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
In fact, we are with young people

2753
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
we actually think

2754
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
My wife and I both feel that

2755
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
he only talks about us

2756
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
We are young at heart

2757
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
we will not age

2758
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
But we feel young at heart

2759
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I think that is the most important

2760
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Finally, the big data you mentioned

2761
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I just express

2762
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
my own opinion

2763
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
This is completely personal opinion

2764
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
we all talk now

2765
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
data science or something

2766
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
I have some reservations about this

2767
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I think too much emphasis on data

2768
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Data is part of our science

2769
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Our collection is the answer to your questions

2770
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
you better ask

2771
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
what question do you want to ask

2772
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I think this is the most important

2773
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So I should make a result

2774
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I don't know how to explain it in the future

2775
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
what was the original question

2776
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
I don't have a main answer like this

2777
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I just want to say that you mentioned big data

2778
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
We have a lot of data

2779
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
now facing this

2780
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
As you can see, it's just a matter of sight

2781
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
This is actually

2782
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
many things are not

2783
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
two sides of one body

2784
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I think both parties need to understand

2785
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Why is it important

2786
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
But from another point of view

2787
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Because making good use of big data can improve human

2788
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
health helps

2789
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I think this goes for both

2790
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
have to take care of

2791
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Our data definitely has

2792
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Big data definitely has

2793
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I'm here to remind everyone

2794
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
When you use it, ask first

2795
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
what question do you want to answer

2796
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I think this is the most important

2797
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
i think there are still many questions

2798
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
But we also have to

2799
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
come to an end

2800
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
advance notice

2801

2805

common momentum

2806
