Good night to many of my colleagues

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It is my pleasure to be here today to host our feast of knowledge today

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Then you can see it from here

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Today we are led by researcher Xu Yaru

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Tell us about the Modai earthquake and tsunami

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think we may have to wait a while to explain this topic

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then let me introduce our keynote speaker today

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Dr Koh graduated from the Department of Earth Sciences, National Central University in 1997

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
is a very young and brilliant scientist

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
After he finished his Ph.D.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Once worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Returned to Academia Sinica 11 years ago in 2006

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
From assistant researcher to assistant researcher

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,960
The researcher just became a political researcher two years ago

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,000
Wait a minute talks about his field of study

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,320
Mainly use this global satellite island navigation system

45
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
This is the GPS on everyone's phone

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,320
use this signal to observe the entire surface of the earth

47
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,360
deformation of the crust

48
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,440
And our research on geodynamics

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,280
So the results of these studies

50
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,960
can tell us something about earthquakes

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,480
About the tsunami caused by the earthquake

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,320
Mainly this is the last generation

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,840
This term will be explained later

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Dr Xu's research

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,240
We will invite him to serve as the main award today

56
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,640
yes he has had a lot of good results lately

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In 2010, he was awarded the Young Scholar Research Writing Award of the Academy

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,440
This is a domestic research for young researchers

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
Most of them are compared with the one who just started

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
either teaching or research

61
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,960
It is just starting to say that young scholars are more outstanding works awards

62
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,960
In 2012, he won the Memorial Award of Mr. Wu Dayou from the Ministry of Science and Technology

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,960
This is also a special award especially for young researchers

64
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,960
In 2017, this year won the Wu Jianxiong Academic Foundation

65
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Taiwan Outstanding Female Scientist Rookie Award

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,960
And this year there is also a Geological Society of the Republic of China

67
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Wang Hanzhuo Dissertation Award

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,960
This is all in the geological world and the earth science world

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Most likely to be one of the late picks in the younger generation

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So we are very happy to have Dr. Xu today

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,400
give us some introduction

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,800
He is at the Institute of Earth Sciences of the Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine

73
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,400
So for this earth science research

74
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,200
And the thing about earthquakes that we are all most interested in

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
We all know that earthquakes are

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,400
It's something we can't avoid

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
often come across

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,600
but for this

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,800
If it happens, there will be great disaster or damage

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,400
So we hope to say that in this study

81
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
be able to understand a little bit more about earthquakes

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,800
maybe one day

83
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,200
We can be able to predict or at least

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,800
Some understanding of these can save them from harm

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
able to minimize

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
So okay, I won't waste everyone's time anymore.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
Then please give warm applause

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,000
Welcome to our today's keynote speaker, Dr. Xu Yaru

89
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Thanks

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,400
First of all, I would like to thank Vice President Zhou for his introduction.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,300
And thank you very much

92
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,300
It's "The Wind and Rain of the Hat" who came to listen to my speech

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,800
So today I'm going to target my past 10 years

94
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,200
Some research done in the screen generation to report to you

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
I will report the main words

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The cause of this screen generation earthquake

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,300
and a mechanism by which it occurs

98
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,000
and some of the associated hazards that it caused this tsunami

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,900
Then how do we use some of the current observation methods

100
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,800
To understand the area where this large earthquake may occur

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,800
Then use some relevant references for follow-up disaster prevention and mitigation work

102
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,700
First of all, the first question I want to ask is

103
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,500
Why We Are Studying the Great Earthquake of the Screen Generation

104
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,600
That's because the big earthquakes of the screen generation usually have a large scale

105
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,700
And the range of its rupture is quite large.

106
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,300
For example, in 2004, the scale of 9.2

107
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,500
This earthquake off the coast of Sumadawa

108
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,000
The earthquake itself has a different rupture length

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,400
over a thousand kilometers

110
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,800
And then he himself because of his mistake

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,000
has grown above the seabed

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,200
So he created a big tsunami

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,920
This tsunami is in addition to

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,800
tree surface beat Yaqi Province

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,560
caused a lot of casualties

116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,960
He spread thousands of miles away to Thailand

117
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,920
also caused many casualties

118
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,360
The earthquake killed a total of 250,000 people

119
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,800
So this is full

120
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,120
this damage

121
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,800
It's actually quite impressive

122
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
In other words, it is 2011

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
This earthquake off the coast of Japan with a scale of 9.0

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,160
What about the earthquake?

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,040
Although the Japanese government has expected that

126
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,320
there will be such an earthquake

127
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,360
But I didn't expect the scale of this earthquake

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
much higher than they estimated

129
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,040
so you see

130
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,480
In fact, in their coastal city

131
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,560
There are already enough so-called tsunami walls

132
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,280
The height of this wall is about 7 meters to 8 meters

133
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,040
But what about the unfortunate tsunami?

134
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,160
Far above this tsunami wall

135
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,520
The slope height that can be defended

136
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
and then slow down here

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
These many areas in Japan

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
caused many casualties

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,500
In addition to the damage of the tsunami itself

140
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Also because of the earthquake

141
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
The nuclear disaster that caused this Fukushima

142
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,000
The Fukushima nuclear disaster actually caused some harm to the entire ecology

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,500
just the longer one

144
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
long-term process

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,500
There is a way to counteract such damage

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,500
Japan because they are among the people for

147
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Earthquake disaster prevention work has been done thoroughly

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
So although its seismic scale

149
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,000
is also close to 9

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But its casualties were probably only 16,000

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,500
With this number of people, about 250,000 people were killed or injured in the earthquake

152
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
In fact, although it is an unfortunate large

153
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,000
Earthquakes in addition to triggering these tsunamis

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's actually caused by strong vibrations on the surface

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
it will cause some landslides

156
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
This is the time of Wenchuan Earthquake

157
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
these landslides

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
These villages under this mountain

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,360
also caused many casualties

160
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,920
This is the 2016 Yumoto earthquake in Japan

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,760
Some landslides near Aso volcano

162
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,560
If the landslide flow is said to block the river course

163
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
Yanse Lake

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,400
If Yanse Lake breaks its embankment

165
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,480
In fact, it will also cause great harm to the downstream residents.

166
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,800
In addition to the strong vibrations of the earthquake itself

167
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,640
It will also cause some older buildings

168
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,720
or the island tower of some poorly constructed building

169
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,920
For example, the island tower of the Weiguan Building in the 2016 Meinong Earthquake

170
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,400
Although these are land earthquakes

171
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,960
But because of the big earthquake on the screen

172
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,840
if it happened at the edge of the land

173
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,480
all these possible disasters

174
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,280
Big earthquakes can happen on the screen

175
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,080
The next thing we learned about the big earthquake on the screen

176
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,280
possible harm

177
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,400
We just want to understand it and study it

178
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Then today I will tell you

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,500
Let me introduce you to this process

180
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
what about first

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,800
I will first introduce the plate theory

182
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,100
Because it is closely related to the screen strip

183
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,700
Then we introduce

184
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,500
One way the crust of the screen strip deforms

185
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,200
Then how do we use modern or

186
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,700
different methods of observation

187
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,900
To understand the deformation of the screen with the crust

188
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,700
Then what

189
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,200
How to inversely calculate from this observation of Dibao

190
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,500
The Situation of Chinese Americans at the Fault Level

191
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,900
Then I will introduce

192
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,000
Two screen strips near Taiwan

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,300
They are the Ryukyu screen belt and the Mara screen belt

194
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,200
what next

195
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,800
Because most of the screen strips are in the sea

196
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,500
So we need to monitor other than on land

197
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,200
In fact, we also need to monitor the deformation of the seabed

198
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,400
So I'm going to introduce you to the deformation of the seabed

199
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,300
Then we will have a little summary at the end

200
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,100
what about first

201
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,400
Let us first introduce the plate theory

202
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
Because the scientists actually warmed the

203
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,100
what did they find

204
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,600
On this eastern coastline of South America

205
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,000
and

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
fly some of the west coast

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,620
It seems that this protruding place and this concave place

208
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,500
These two can be pieced together if moved over

209
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,840
So what do you say?

210
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,960
scientists are thinking

211
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,840
Hey, are these two continents very close?

212
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Were they linked together in ancient times?

213
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,240
As for the doctors, they started looking for a lot of geological evidence

214
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,040
to see the possibility

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, first of all, they will take a look at this ancient creature.

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Discovered South America and Flying Facts

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,500
They have the same species that had the same creatures in ancient times

218
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
What if at that time

219
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,000
South America and Fei Zhongge's One Atlantic

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There is no way this species can spread

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So the first condition for their species to spread

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,500
That is, these two continents are connected by Piling

223
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,500
So they based on the distribution of these ancient organisms in different five continents

224
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:59,000
Then try to piece together what dimension these continents were in in the past

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What about the other words?

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
There is also some evidence of paleoclimate

227
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
For example, the direction in which a glacier is moving

228
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,000
or from these three-pentagonal directions

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then go to the previous time 300 million years ago

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
In fact, the situation in the mainland is like this

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That is, the five continents are connected together in the world

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,500
But now they are a separate

233
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
So scientists started to understand

234
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
In fact, the plate itself is for drifting

235
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
it is for exercise

236
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,000
The new land may be in the central and deep city

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,500
Mainly because there are some radioactive elements in the ground and below

238
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,000
can provide some fun

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So the new land may be in the central and deep city

240
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Then move slowly to the sides

241
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
that's why

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Just move to the side

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The sun is cooling down at once

244
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It increases in density after cooling

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,500
After the density increases, it will slowly sink

246
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
And then finally the screen is under the continental plate

247
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, this actually has the above when we boil water

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,500
If there is a paradise below

249
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
Then the water will move to both sides

250
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
which is similar to

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
In the process of cloaking the oceanic crust

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
friction with the upper plate

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And then there's what's called an earthquake

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's why there are many big earthquakes in the Era

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
that's why it happened

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If we look at the past over 4000 years

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Distribution of Earthquakes in World History

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can see that red represents the number of casualties

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
More than 1000 people

260
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yellow is probably the number of casualties between 100 and 1000

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Other colors are relatively minor earthquakes

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You can see that the major earthquakes are around plate boundaries

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
For example, along the perimeter of the Pacific plate

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Then the South Park of Eurasia

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Near the Sanda Trench we just talked about

266
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
In fact, there are quite a few earthquakes here.

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But because there are relatively few people living here

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So the casualties are not as heavy as in other places

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is also the distribution of historical tsunamis

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Probably also the distribution of historical tsunamis over the past 3600 years

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There are many causes of tsunamis

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
it can be triggered by an earthquake

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Can be erupted by underwater volcanoes

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
or caused by landslides under the sea

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If it is caused by an earthquake

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It is displayed here in a circle

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you can see that is to say

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Most of these catastrophic tsunamis

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In fact, they all revolve around the Pacific plate.

280
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
nearby

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Circum-Pacific Seismic Belt

282
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it's happening here

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
After we learn about some of the behavior of screen strips

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's see if it's on screen

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How did the crust of this place deform?

286
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
here is a

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
sorry

288
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
ok , sorry , let ' s broadcast like this

289
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,600
This picture depicts the deformation behavior of hidden tendrils

290
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,800
You can see that the oceanic crust is slowly creeping down

291
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
But because it is a fault because of the relationship between the underlying layer

292
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,400
moshaleh effect it belongs to the state of doing

293
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Then it can continue to move in a deeper place

294
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,800
The cryptic effect is going on all the time

295
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
So in places closer to the trench

296
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
this is the place

297
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,000
The entire continental crust will be arched

298
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,600
You can see there is a reference station GPR station here

299
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,500
inland direction movement

300
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,900
until this station reaches the maximum displacement

301
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,200
Energy accumulation has no way to accumulate more energy

302
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
it produces earthquakes

303
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,400
If the earthquake breaks out to sea it creates a tsunami

304
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,800
and caused a lot of casualties

305
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,600
after the whole gag is over

306
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Energy starts to accumulate again

307
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,600
Then start the cycle of the next earthquake

308
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,600
This is the lattice deformation of the screen strips we often see

309
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,100
So in a place close to the sea structure

310
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,600
It will be found that after the earthquake

311
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,400
Has some terrestrial imaging role

312
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,600
For example, this is a coconut tree by the sea

313
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,900
Basically, these coconut trees should grow above the intermediary zone

314
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,200
But now they are all within the range of the interzone

315
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,800
and many coconut trees are dead

316
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Mainly because of the coast caused by this earthquake

317
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
generate a large number of renders

318
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
caused the death of these many coconut trees

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Here is also a case presented in the ground

320
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If we were to take a closer look

321
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Screen deformation behavior with earthquakes

322
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We can simplify slightly

323
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
represented by the following diagrams

324
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Suppose this line represents the surface

325
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
This line is the interface of the panel of the screen

326
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We can move faults across plate interfaces

327
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
represented by this diagram

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
We can see this line

329
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The above is called the top plate, and the bottom is called the bottom plate

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If this place can be

331
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
free screen words

332
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
location across the fault

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
a surface deformation you see

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's just a jiedihan tree

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That is to say, everything east of this line belongs to ascending

336
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
All west of this line are offline

337
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's because of fault sneaking

338
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
it belongs to a locked state

339
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So we often observe

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,280
The phenomenon is that the deformation is very small near the fault

341
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,720
But far from the fault

342
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,720
The magnitude of its movement is just like that of the original factory.

343
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,320
That is, the plates move at the same speed.

344
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,200
That's because earthquake observations can tell us

345
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,840
where the fault might be located

346
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,720
So what?

347
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,200
we have this

348
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,720
The observation data of this original factory

349
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,880
There are also some observational data based on faults

350
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,440
we can speculate

351
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,360
What should the Jianghai Earthquake look like?

352
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,600
Because what these two villages need is equal to this

353
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,400
this cold tree

354
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
Then we can speculate

355
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,280
What about the Jianghai earthquake?

356
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,800
the extent to which it may break when it occurs

357
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
Then its possible fault geometry

358
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
what is it like

359
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,880
what if

360
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Let's look at it another way

361
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
This is the deformation behavior of the surface

362
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,960
Then if we look at the motion behavior on the fault

363
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,400
can be represented by this diagram

364
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,360
This representative is Fault Huayi

365
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,960
The case of a distribution at different depths

366
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You can imagine the energy slowly accumulating at a relatively deep place before an earthquake occurs

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Because in a relatively deep place, because of the relationship between the delayed temperature and pressure characteristics

368
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
it's some plastic deformation

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So the plate can always be on the screen

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Then the energy slowly accumulates in the deep place

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
If we assume that the line of earthquakes in this place is around 1000 years

372
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Then this fault slips at a rate of 2mm per year

373
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Then you know that after 1000 years of sliding

374
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It has actually accumulated 20 meters of this energy

375
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Then the process of accumulating energy is a very slow process

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
However, when an earthquake occurs, it is a very fast process.

377
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Let's say it's been 1000 years

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Then the upper fault has reached a zero connection

379
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
an earthquake rupture

380
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This earthquake rupture may take 20 to 30 seconds

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Then the whole rupture is done

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
so you can imagine

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You have to accumulate energy for 1000 years and that's it

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Released at 20 seconds and 30 seconds

385
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,840
the harm it caused

386
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,440
Of course it is considerable

387
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,840
At this time, if its energy is fully released

388
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,400
Then it will slide 20 meters

389
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Then if you slide 20 meters

390
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,240
this is if your family

391
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,840
If I'm next to the fault line

392
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,040
I think it should be asexual

393
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,480
will be greatly damaged by these

394
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,200
if it doesn't fully suspect

395
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
For example, in some places it is just

396
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,400
it doesn't release all the energy

397
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,160
after the earthquake

398
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,560
It will also have a persistent so-called post-earthquake doubt

399
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,360
to release the energy

400
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
Then this time scale may be

401
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,520
Timescales of years to decades

402
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,680
Then this is probably one

403
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,880
One way the Earth's crust deforms

404
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,160
Then let's see

405
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,800
Sumatra Screen Strip

406
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,040
Since this place was in 2004

407
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,320
This magnitude 9.2 earthquake occurred

408
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,160
Then this green area

409
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,840
is the range where it breaks

410
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,080
Then one degree is roughly equal to 110 kilometers

411
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,520
you see how far it breaks

412
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,920
In fact it has been more than 10 degrees

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,240
So there's more than 1,000 kilometers of rupture

414
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240
What about this hidden belt?

415
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,740
In fact, it is the junction of the hard Austrian plate and the Shangda block

416
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,540
The aggregate number of that plate is about 57 mimi per year

417
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,040
Except for the magnitude 9.2 earthquake in 2004

418
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,540
It actually had another earthquake with a magnitude of 8.7 after 2005

419
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,940
Then follow up

420
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,840
Earthquakes of magnitudes 7 and 8 also occurred in Sumida West Toilet

421
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,140
Then you can see there are some

422
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,080
For example, the magnitude 7.9 earthquake in 1881

423
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,380
1797 and 1833

424
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,580
those old earthquakes

425
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
how scientists know to say

426
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,880
There was a self-written earthquake in that era

427
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,380
OK, let's make an introduction for you next.

428
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,980
It is how we monitor the deformation process of these vertical shells

429
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,180
then we used various methods

430
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,880
A way to compare current observations is to

431
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,380
Global Navigation WeChat Positioning System

432
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,420
Interferometry with Synthetic Aperture Radar

433
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,480
This is all using WeChat technology

434
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,980
Then what

435
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,880
If you want to know the relatively old events

436
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,380
you have to rely on some examples

437
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,680
For example, let's go pick some sea-grass

438
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,340
some nutrition for dating

439
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,780
or we go to see the coral reef

440
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,320
an example of his growth

441
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,360
Then I'll introduce you one by one

442
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,960
First of all, let's introduce

443
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,060
GNSS

444
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,260
What about this? In fact, he is a

445
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,260
It is the same as our usual car navigation

446
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,340
It's just that the accuracy of car navigation is actually

447
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,180
maybe a few meters

448
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,080
But we do this scientific research

449
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,640
The precision of our medicine may be up to

450
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,540
The level of minimeter

451
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,940
In fact, now this

452
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,920
There are different countries in the sky

453
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,320
different countries have satellites

454
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,080
Then do the positioning

455
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,280
Like the United States, there is this GPS system

456
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,920
In Russia, there is a Gonus system

457
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Then in Japan they have the QVSS system

458
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Then EU has this potential rate system

459
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,800
Then mainland China also has their Beidou system

460
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,460
What about these satellites?

461
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,980
is probably

462
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,880
The satellite orbits at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometers

463
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,240
Then its track design is different

464
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,680
But its main essence is to wish to say

465
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,780
We are anytime anywhere

466
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,680
Can receive at least three or more satellites for positioning

467
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,820
So why do you need three satellites?

468
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,680
Then we can use this diagram to illustrate

469
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,400
What if I'm the captain

470
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,360
I don't know where I am now

471
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,700
Then I went to receive the signal from this satellite

472
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,600
Then receive the time from the satellite signal

473
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,400
I know how far I am from this satellite

474
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,040
Let's say I'm a thousand kilometers away from this satellite

475
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,100
then i know

476
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,440
All my positions on this ship

477
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,180
May be anywhere on this garden boat

478
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,780
But it doesn't tell me where I am

479
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,420
So I have to go and receive the second satellite

480
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,960
Then hand over the other garden

481
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,020
so i know

482
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,420
my location is not in this location

483
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,520
right here

484
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,820
but i want to make sure

485
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,720
Is it this location or this location

486
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,020
I have to accept the second satellite

487
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
The third WeChat signal

488
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
then i know

489
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,600
So I'm right here

490
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,100
That's why we need

491
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,900
Three WeChat to do this navigation

492
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,300
to do positioning

493
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
what about the fact

494
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,400
We have also done a lot in Taiwan

495
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,600
The so-called fixed station of this GPS

496
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,700
Then we mainly accept

497
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,900
This signal from the US WeChat

498
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,000
what about these

499
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,800
Where are these side stations?

500
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,000
is that we're going on a regular basis

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,700
to measure its coordinates

502
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,700
Then there is this coordinate change

503
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,800
we'll know

504
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,400
One state for each side station movement

505
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
What about this picture?

506
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,500
Different colors represent different units

507
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,600
point of color

508
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,400
The red color is from the Meteorological Bureau and the Earth Institute.

509
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,600
colored dots

510
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,000
then blue is the interior

511
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,900
point of color

512
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
Then green is other units

513
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,600
a point of the color

514
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,900
That's what we do wild

515
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,300
Some circumstances of residence

516
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Some of these points are called fixed stations

517
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
fixed station means

518
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,800
It is recording data 24 hours a day

519
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,400
Instruments and antennas are left in this place

520
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,000
then we will be on the surface

521
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,100
we'll fight underground

522
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
then there is a stone

523
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Then when we make a vegetable gallery, it is a finalized product

524
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and then go and measure this rocky center point

525
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This coordinate changes over time

526
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Then this one is like a mobile plant in the wild.

527
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
is that it is not fixed

528
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We may measure once a year

529
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Then observe the change of this coordinate with time

530
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Then, in fact, this field work is quite hard.

531
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Then also full of horror

532
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I remember almost twenty years ago

533
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Sometimes I go to Chiayi with my classmates

534
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Mei Shan Lane to do this field work

535
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Then it was about three or four o'clock

536
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
afternoon time

537
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
then it was almost afternoon

538
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
thunderstorm rainy day very dark

539
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That's because our field survey goes once a year

540
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So the grass basically grows taller than a person

541
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Then we all have to take the knife

542
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Then rummage in the grass to find our spots

543
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Because this point is actually not very easy to find

544
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
sometimes covered with soil

545
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
As a result, we couldn't find it after searching for a long time.

546
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Then I separated from my classmates

547
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
separately to find

548
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It didn't take long

549
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,500
There's a grave with a picture on it

550
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
right at me

551
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
Then

552
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
at that time

553
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,000
I feel a current

554
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
all the way down my spine

555
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
wear to forehead

556
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,500
Then for the first time I experienced what it means to have a chill down your spine

557
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,000
because then i knew

558
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
wow, it really is

559
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,500
It really feels like there is electricity

560
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,000
At that time, the previous life thought

561
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I really need to get out of this place

562
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
Yes, okay follow up

563
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,000
When I told this joke to my assistant the day before yesterday

564
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
he asked me

565
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
do you remember what that photo looked like

566
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'll just talk to him

567
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
i just don't remember

568
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
yes it's actually

569
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
We actually have a lot of these in the wild

570
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
some assortment

571
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Some are actually quite scary

572
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
but

573
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Even we outdoor public still have to be very careful

574
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Because in fact, there are often various states

575
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Will appear

576
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Okay then I'll stop talking about horror

577
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's move on

578
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Then this is our Taiwan GPS fixed

579
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
in our measured

580
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The movement speed of the test battle is long

581
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
That's a GPS watch

582
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
need time series

583
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
This is the east-west component, the north-south component and the vertical component

584
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,400
So if we

585
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,500
For example, this is the record from 2004 to 2017

586
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,900
Then if we are doing measurements every day

587
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
This is the fixed station data

588
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,300
we can get a point

589
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,700
Then there are long-term observations

590
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,600
We can get this time series of a motion

591
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
Then we can do linear regression

592
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,700
We know the speed of Ce Zhan's movement

593
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,000
Then when the earthquake happened

594
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,200
For example, this is the Meifeng earthquake

595
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,400
This is a battle near Guan Temple

596
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,300
then you can find out

597
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,200
when the earthquake happened

598
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
it will result in the displacement

599
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
So there will be a jump here

600
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,600
there will be a discontinuity

601
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,400
Then there will be some post-earthquake displacement

602
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,100
Then slowly it will return to

603
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,200
It is the relatively linear one before the earthquake.

604
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,400
a state of motion

605
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,900
then we can use this information

606
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,100
to do a lot later

607
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,700
It is some follow-up research work

608
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,100
Well, besides these, this global navigation satellite positioning system

609
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,200
We can also use this

610
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Core Aperture Mirror Radar Gamma Layer

611
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,260
sound appreciation

612
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
The English name is here

613
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Basically it is also a data using satellite

614
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
So this is where the satellites fly

615
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Then it has a

616
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,760
This one can sweep the floor

617
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,260
It uses the radar slope to sweep a feature on the surface

618
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,260
And because of the scan time difference?

619
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,760
I know this direction

620
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,260
From satellite to any point on the surface

621
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,760
Then I can know the distance in this direction

622
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
The amount of change

623
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Let's say there's a volcano here

624
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
What about when you sweep the terrain?

625
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Its shape is like this

626
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
but behind

627
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Because the volcano has produced some deformation

628
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
What about during the second sweep?

629
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
It has a difference amount to the bit

630
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Then you can have this bitwise difference amount

631
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
To calculate is along the

632
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
How big is the deformation depending on the direction of the satellite?

633
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Then this is what we use

634
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
synthetic aperture

635
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Radar interferometry data

636
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Go Sweep Out During Beauty Earthquake

637
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,700
These deformed strips around

638
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,100
These are the changes in phase

639
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,200
We can take it and go through some calculations

640
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Convert it to the potential of the ground resonance on the east and west

641
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
vertical position

642
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,800
then you can see that

643
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,100
In the words of beauty earthquake

644
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,500
In the market near Guanmiao

645
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
TSMC has more than 10 cm on the market

646
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,700
It's actually pretty big

647
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,700
There is some deformation of about 5 to 10 cm in the horizontal volume

648
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,700
What I just talked about are some more realistic observation methods.

649
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,200
So if we want to know about some older earthquakes

650
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
we have to rely on the sea

651
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
For example, Haijie

652
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,700
There are many seashores like these in eastern Taiwan

653
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,200
For example, the stone ladder is leveled.

654
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,200
This is some research done by a Japanese research team in Taiwan

655
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,700
Then this is Haijie near Shitiping

656
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Then it goes from the lowest level to the highest level

657
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,200
About 20 meters away

658
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
then it has several stages

659
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,700
The geologists are going to collect some rocks on this base

660
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,700
then do research

661
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
They know the history of these grounding platforms

662
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Some of the history of these platform depths are related to the rise and fall of the sea level

663
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Some are related to the depth of the earth

664
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They have to do some progressive analysis

665
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
like this beautiful grounding

666
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Can do some related follow-up research work

667
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
In addition to coastal grounding, you can also use the belt area

668
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
coral reef

669
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Coral reefs are actually coral reefs because it only grows below sea level

670
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So we can take advantage of this condition

671
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Go see how we use coral reefs to record the history of earthquakes

672
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
This records the growth process of a coral reef

673
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
this is how high it grows and this is the time

674
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Then the coral reef slowly grows taller

675
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
so you can see it growing higher and higher

676
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
getting higher over time

677
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
at this time if there is

678
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
It can't grow taller after it touches the sea level

679
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
it can only grow sideways

680
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So its height is to maintain the video

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But what if there is an event that causes the sea floor to collapse?

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Basically, the growth height of these coral gums behind it will be shorter than the original ones.

683
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And what if there's a seismic event that causes the sea floor to appear?

684
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The height of the coral glue that grows behind it can be higher than the one that came before

685
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
OK so we can go to these screens nearby

686
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Find these large coral gels

687
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Then we cut it open, and after cutting it open

688
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You take some of these samples for dating

689
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Then go and see, that is, when

690
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It has some, for example, massive die-off of coral gum

691
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Then it may be related to some earthquake events

692
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Then use this to find some older earthquake events

693
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Well, if the earthquake is big enough, we can actually directly

694
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Measure the amount of coral gel and we'll know

695
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
How much vertical displacement did the earthquake produce at this location

696
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
This is after the 2004 Sumada Earthquake

697
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Everyone can see that

698
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
All coral reefs are lifted above sea level

699
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Then we can directly measure

700
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Because of the vertical displacement caused by the earthquake

701
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Then this is a coral reef to measure

702
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
2005 scale 8.6

703
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Vertical Displacement Caused by the Great Sumata Earthquake

704
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The position of zero deformation is at this place

705
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Coral reefs from this line to the creek are all uplifted

706
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The maximum lift is up to 2.5 meters

707
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Edom is offline

708
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The largest drop is up to 1 meter

709
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That lift should be a good amount

710
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But those who are offline may have to dive to measure

711
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
so do the work

712
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
In fact, as you can imagine, it is very hard work.

713
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
that apart from coral reef observation

714
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We just could use this GPS

715
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
This is the global satellite positioning system

716
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
To measure the coseismic displacement of the Banshui earthquake

717
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
For example, the red line

718
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,240
It was during the 2005 earthquake

719
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,880
The displacement of the surface on both sides of it

720
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,180
The largest is actually nearly 4 meters

721
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,640
Then with these observations

722
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,840
Next we're going to see

723
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,780
How do we get from these surface observations

724
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,680
to understand the behavior of the fault's activity

725
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,180
Then we can actually use a very simple theory

726
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,840
Let me explain to you

727
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,600
It is a model of semi-wireless space

728
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,700
because assuming this is us

729
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,100
It is a deformed appearance observed on the surface

730
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,000
Then scientists know that

731
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,200
Where might the underground fault be located?

732
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,800
Then we know that

733
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,000
on that fault

734
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,600
If there is a dislocation of the unit on the fault of the unit

735
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,500
anywhere on the earth

736
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,300
How big will be the horizontal and vertical differences

737
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,300
So our job is to find a combination

738
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,500
This combination actually has different forms of Huayi

739
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,000
Let's see how we can go

740
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,200
Fitting Observations to the Surface

741
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,800
This is a reverse process

742
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,400
Then we can go back to calculate

743
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,600
The Situation of Chinese Americans on the Fault Level

744
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,600
what about this

745
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
that we are first

746
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,000
Need to know the geometry of the fault

747
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
that fault geometry

748
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,600
We can know from the distribution of earthquakes

749
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,200
for example

750
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
This is in the Sumata region

751
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,000
A case of earthquake distribution

752
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,400
Then we will draw a profi

753
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,200
then we know

754
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,800
The distribution of this earthquake

755
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,600
distribution of a collection space

756
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
then we know

757
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,600
Possible Situation Angles of Faults

758
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
For example, the latent layer may be slower

759
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
Humidity Deep places are steeper

760
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,200
then we can

761
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,800
Apply the geometry using this fault

762
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,600
then calculate

763
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,800
The distribution of its ethnic Chinese on the fault level

764
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,600
The red and yellow room is

765
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
The number of Chinese on this fault level

766
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,400
projected onto the surface of a

767
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
is a distribution

768
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
and black

769
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
is our observation

770
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,600
that pink words

771
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
is the predicted value of our model

772
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
then you can see this

773
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,600
In fact, the fit is pretty good.

774
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
then we know

775
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,020
In this 2005 earthquake

776
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,400
its setback

777
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,600
Nearly at least 12 meters of setback

778
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,560
What about after the third?

779
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,160
Actually

780
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,440
these have been

781
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,120
Many of these book exhibitions in this disaster area

782
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,900
in fact there will be

783
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,860
There will also be a situation of continuous motion

784
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,500
That's mainly because some energy

785
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,860
Not fully released during the earthquake

786
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,100
So it will have a case of actively moving

787
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,300
For example, in this Raiva book exhibition

788
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,600
This is the time of the earthquake

789
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,400
After that earthquake you can find that it has a

790
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,860
A variation of the direct decay

791
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,060
very strong change

792
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,400
Then finally stabilized slowly

793
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,000
slower again

794
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,160
then this is

795
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,460
Beeson's book exhibition

796
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,240
with Samp

797
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,140
it has the same

798
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,500
That is, it will deform rapidly after the earthquake

799
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,200
Then slowly it will return to

800
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,800
It is at the speed of deformation before the earthquake

801
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
This is the so-called exact deformation

802
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,540
Then we will introduce to you

803
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,940
It is this screen bag near Taiwan

804
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
This is the structure of a ground near the screen strip in Taiwan

805
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Because Taiwan is located at the junction of the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate

806
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Off the northeastern coast of Taiwan, the Philippine Sea Plate follows the Ryeball Trench

807
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Then the screen goes under the Eurasian plate

808
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
To the south is the Eurasian plate along the Mara Trench

809
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Screen to the bottom of the Philippine Binghai plate

810
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Then the heavy bone fault in eastern Taiwan is the wind and belt of these two plates

811
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
To the east of the heavy bone fault is the Philippine Sea plate

812
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
To the west is the Eurasian plate

813
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Because Taiwan's rate of plate aggregation in this place

814
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
In fact, it can be as high as 90 meters on average

815
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Then in the south and north are the main screens

816
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
In the middle is the collision

817
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So Taiwan will have a mountain with a height of nearly 4 kilometers

818
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's here that in fact it's collision-based

819
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Next to it, there are actually two very large screen strips

820
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So we have to evaluate

821
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Will there be a big screen with earthquakes near Taiwan in the future?

822
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So what is this? Over the past 100 years?

823
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Some Major Earthquakes Near Taiwan

824
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Then here are some earthquakes with the scale of Six Flags

825
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Then the color represents the depth of the earthquake

826
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Then the bigger the earthquake the bigger the circle

827
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
What about the past hundred years?

828
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The main earthquake can be seen off the coast of Ryukyu

829
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
with the eastern seas of Taiwan

830
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
There were also some big earthquakes on that land

831
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
But compared with the earthquakes in the Ryukyu Sea Country, there are relatively few

832
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
The largest earthquake was a magnitude 7.7 earthquake in 1920

833
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Near Lake Ryukyu

834
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Are there some tsunami events near Taiwan?

835
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
that's true

836
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Because Japanese scholars have investigated some

837
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Some information on the lake on Ryukyu Island

838
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
found in 1771

839
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,960
This year, in fact, the subsurface layer of the Ryukyu Trench may have a rupture of the subsurface layer.

840
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,760
Generating a Turtle Baa Earthquake

841
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,240
In fact, the Kameo Hachia earthquake was

842
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,640
caused these tsunamis to be seen near these islands

843
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,280
The height of the tsunami was actually more than 30 meters

844
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,840
So it's actually pretty impressive

845
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,920
Then there is the Mara Trench

846
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,320
The Mara Trench actually extends to the south of Taiwan to the Philippines

847
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,040
That's because Luzon was colonized by Spain in the 17th century

848
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,520
Then we read in the past

849
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,800
It is the data of these past histories

850
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,640
In fact, for the past 400 years he

851
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,160
There is no earthquake in this hidden vine belt

852
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,960
But will it happen in the future

853
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,680
In fact, there is a lot of uncertainty

854
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,240
Just like the 2004 Sumatra earthquake

855
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,160
The Sumada earthquake, the earthquake in that place started online

856
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,880
In fact, about a thousand years ago

857
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,080
So what do you say in this

858
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Although this place has not had a major earthquake in the past 400 years

859
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
But we cannot rule out that it will not have a major earthquake in the future

860
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
So we still have to study some deformation behaviors in this place

861
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Then let's introduce the Ryukyu Trench first.

862
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Because the Ryukyu Trench is relatively tight

863
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
This is what happened when the earthquake collapsed off the coast of northeastern Taiwan

864
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Lighter colors are shallower earthquakes

865
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Deeper is a deeper earthquake

866
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
so you can see what the screen does

867
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
if we go from here

868
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This is an instant noodle from the Ryukyu Trench

869
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You can see the distribution of these earthquakes generated by the plate screen

870
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Then we can use these in eastern Taiwan

871
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Velocity yields of crustal deformation observed on land

872
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
to calculate is to say

873
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Will there be a major earthquake in this place in the future?

874
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
if it had a big earthquake

875
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
what its possible ruptured form looks like

876
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the magnitude of the earthquake it can produce

877
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
what a situation

878
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,960
Because our strategy is all on land

879
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,200
So in fact we can probably say that

880
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,840
closer to the coast

881
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,840
It's actually possible for energy to build up here

882
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,840
But we have no way to speculate that

883
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,880
How long will its rupture range extend?

884
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,720
The reference here is mainly to refer to the distribution of earthquakes.

885
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,320
Because now is the flow of the last generation

886
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,720
Between the Peaceful Basin and the Nahai Basin

887
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,520
There is a very dense earthquake bill

888
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,760
So we think the area where it broke may be this area

889
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,440
According to some empirical formulas of seismologists

890
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,240
We know the likely rupture area of ââan earthquake

891
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,560
Let's say the length is 120 kilometers

892
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,240
Then the width is 70 km

893
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,480
then we can calculate its earthquake size

894
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,040
Probably around 7.5 to 8

895
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,480
But if we use another method

896
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,520
Assume that the earthquakes here have a period of 1500 years

897
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,480
Then it was broken into a loss rate of 86 meters.

898
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,100
The largest scale is 8.6

899
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
The largest scale mentioned here means

900
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,740
All the energy accumulated here

901
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,940
Released once by an earthquake

902
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,140
Of course, if it has many earthquakes

903
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,780
release these energies slowly

904
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,380
Then maybe it won't be this big

905
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,320
will be smaller

906
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,580
So let's use this cracked paper model to see

907
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,820
If such an earthquake occurs in this place

908
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,620
what kind of behavior

909
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,820
good

910
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,880
please wait

911
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,560
Okay, this is the model we just used

912
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,400
to calculate

913
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,300
If the earthquake happened

914
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,400
what harm will it do

915
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,840
here represents this

916
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,940
The velocity of a positive wave passing through a

917
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,580
Then this side represents the wave height generated by the tsunami

918
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,840
then you can see

919
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,000
The seismic waves of this tsunami travel first

920
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
The tsunami was generated after the transmission

921
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
And then this tsunami will do a lot of damage all over the east coast

922
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The maximum breaking height can reach about 4 meters

923
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You can see this is

924
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
The shooting range is about 2 meters to 4 meters

925
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
along this eastern coast

926
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In fact, there are quite a few changes

927
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And what about the tsunami?

928
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Ship bypassing Taiwan to the Taiwan Strait

929
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
A case of boat waves

930
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and what about the east

931
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
There is still some back and forth

932
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Because of the back and forth shock of the tsunami waves

933
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Then what

934
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
can see this

935
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
In fact there are almost 2 to 4 meters of some

936
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Brogao will clean these places

937
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
then go around

938
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
to the Taiwan Strait

939
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
That's because the main rupture direction of this earthquake

940
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
is the direction of the Pacific Ocean

941
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So in fact, for western Taiwan,

942
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Its harm is less obvious

943
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
but in the east

944
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
In fact its impact is quite significant

945
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
This is probably a tsunami boat

946
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Situation of transmission

947
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,600
This is what our earth

948
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,240
Provided by Li Xianzhong Associate Research Institute

949
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,600
next we will see

950
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
us

951
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,200
how do scientists know

952
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,000
Has there ever been a tsunami in this place?

953
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,200
how do we study these tsunamis

954
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,600
older events of these tsunamis

955
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,000
There are several methods

956
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,200
For example we can go

957
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,400
these seaside to do some

958
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,600
sampling work

959
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,400
To see the distribution of these grades

960
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,800
then go see say

961
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,800
Is this related to the tsunami?

962
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
Tsunami-related grades

963
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
otherwise we can go to the beach

964
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Find these very large boulders

965
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,600
Because such a large rock

966
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,800
it's no way through that

967
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,600
It's just that these waves go

968
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,800
move to shore

969
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,560
Usually it's ten dollars

970
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,520
or typhoon

971
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,560
Or a tsunami

972
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,040
to be transported to the coast

973
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,920
So scientists can go and find

974
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,840
just to collect some

975
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,680
some samples for dating

976
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,520
Then learned that he was relocated to

977
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,200
The terrain of this coast

978
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,120
then go and see say

979
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,520
Is he with some

980
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,320
Events that implicitly bring about earthquakes are related

981
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,200
what about other than that

982
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,600
It is to rely on historical documents to record now

983
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,720
For example, Taiwan

984
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,320
There are also some records of tsunamis

985
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,440
Most definitely dated to 1867

986
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,160
in Keelung?

987
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,760
There was once a tsunami event

988
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,760
There are some historical records over here

989
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,720
Then everyone can take a look

990
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,040
that's the reaction here

991
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,160
That is to say, the water in the port recedes

992
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,160
until all the fish move in mud or water

993
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,360
struggle with

994
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,520
And what about these fathers, daughters and children?

995
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,280
just go and run

996
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,160
to examine this baby's gift

997
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,880
Then what

998
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,720
The results of it

999
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,400
What about sea water?

1000
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,080
first back

1001
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
A very important feature of a tsunami is that the sea water will recede first

1002
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
and then it will come back

1003
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And when you come back, the height is very high

1004
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Then there will be a great disaster

1005
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Then this world is recorded in historical documents

1006
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
That except in this English literature

1007
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
The world is made in Tamsui Hall

1008
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And there are records in the world

1009
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
That is to say, there were some tsunami incidents at that time

1010
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Then hundreds of people died like this

1011
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Then we can also learn from these historical Christian districts

1012
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Find records of these tsunamis

1013
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Then we based on the description of these historical documents

1014
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Go see this site where these tsunamis have occurred in the past

1015
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
where is it now

1016
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Then we make it beautiful

1017
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Then slowly go to find

1018
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
what was the source of the possible tsunami

1019
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
besides these

1020
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Like the archaeological team of Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University in Keelung North

1021
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
They just do some research on cultural chairs

1022
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Then they found out during their investigation that

1023
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Like this Uni3 this

1024
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
this grade level

1025
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,760
it's a walrus

1026
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,320
high-concentration water-like

1027
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,440
formed by an accumulation

1028
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,080
So maybe it has something to do with the tsunami

1029
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,080
So scientists can actually do

1030
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:11,880
Grass hook

1031
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,600
Then go to the source of these grades

1032
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,000
and then speculate that

1033
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,920
what grades

1034
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,680
Maybe it's related to the tsunami

1035
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,840
Those same technologies are in fact

1036
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,920
can also be used for this

1037
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,680
Some of the inbound faults

1038
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,360
repeat cycle

1039
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,360
The response cycle is a

1040
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,120
some studies like this

1041
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,520
Then we introduce this

1042
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,760
after the ryukyu screen bag

1043
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
Next we're going to look at Mara Screen Bags

1044
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,640
That mara screen bag in fact

1045
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,440
In fact, it is quite far from Taiwan.

1046
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:38,800
yes

1047
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,240
It actually starts from the south of Taiwan

1048
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,240
stretches all the way to luzon

1049
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,040
But should we pay attention to it

1050
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,800
we really need to pay attention to it

1051
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,120
Because if a relatively large rupture tsunami occurs here,

1052
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,680
just go this way

1053
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,880
If the boat over here

1054
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,320
will cause mainland China

1055
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,960
Vietnam on the southeast coast

1056
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,880
Then many countries in Southeast Asia

1057
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,000
will be implicated

1058
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
What about the tsunami, hit it and bounce back

1059
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
For those who dive into the sea in the west of Taiwan

1060
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
These are the cities on the coast

1061
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
In fact, there will be some great influence

1062
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Then everyone can see that

1063
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
This plate goes to the river data to follow in Taiwan

1064
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
A little more than here near Taiwan

1065
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
About 92 mimiteps one or two

1066
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
In addition to this place

1067
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
This big one with foam

1068
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
big this drowning fault

1069
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It actually also has a

1070
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
In the Philippines there is a large this China fault

1071
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Philippine fault

1072
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Then this fault is also a

1073
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
A very dangerous fault

1074
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Then let's focus on this today

1075
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Mala shadow tape

1076
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Then this is across this shadow foam belt

1077
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The distribution of earthquakes

1078
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That color represents the depth of different earthquakes

1079
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
The red ones are relatively shallow earthquakes

1080
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Then the blue purple is a deeper earthquake

1081
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
That's different profi

1082
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Then I took 3 to 5 today

1083
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Let me show you these instant noodles

1084
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
You can clearly see this

1085
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Shadow Foam's Angle

1086
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,120
slowly change

1087
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,380
In fact, it has turned into a collision effect here.

1088
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,580
In fact our earth

1089
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:12,480
As long as in 1996, in fact, a lot of observation work has been done in Brigade

1090
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,100
This picture is from about 20 years ago

1091
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,300
We did some GPS work over here

1092
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,920
This is the GPS level speed we obtained

1093
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,360
Relative to this point the velocity of the factory

1094
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,680
This is the vertical speed factory

1095
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,440
We use these GPS observations

1096
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,540
Let's reverse the distribution of Chinese on this fault line

1097
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
This is the result we got

1098
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,560
We can get a so-called plate of Orheb

1099
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,720
Plate Orheb it's actually a fault rate for Chinese descent

1100
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,720
Divided by the long-term Chinese rate

1101
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,140
So if this value is higher

1102
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,520
Represents the growing likelihood of a major rupture

1103
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,560
if smaller

1104
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,960
It is safer in comparison

1105
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,920
So we have provided two models here

1106
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,960
blue represents

1107
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Faults are usually in the state of creeping

1108
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,360
So keep releasing energy

1109
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,440
is a relatively safe state

1110
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,360
the red area

1111
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,800
This means it belongs to a locked state

1112
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,920
That is to say, a big earthquake in the future

1113
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,040
It is possible for a relatively large rupture

1114
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,160
that black arrow

1115
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,240
It means that when an earthquake occurs in the future

1116
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,360
These curations of the possible surface

1117
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,920
a way of movement

1118
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,000
Then we can use these

1119
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,520
surface data area to invert

1120
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,200
In fact, our model

1121
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,320
because we entered the trench

1122
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,720
In fact it's not obvious

1123
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,760
Not a good few observation points

1124
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,320
So in fact we're near the trench

1125
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,560
Our model resolution

1126
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,920
actually not very good

1127
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,720
Therefore, in addition to making observations on land,

1128
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,920
In fact, we also have to go

1129
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,600
Observing these behaviors of these deformations on the seabed

1130
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,960
Then I will introduce

1131
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,960
The way our planet is going to develop now

1132
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,320
The first one is sea floor geodesy.

1133
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,520
The seabed geodesy is actually

1134
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,960
Integrated GPS satellite positioning system

1135
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Positioning with deep wave

1136
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
For example, we have to be on the seabed

1137
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
place these deep wave transponders

1138
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Then we go out with fishing boats

1139
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
We will put these GPS on the fishing boat

1140
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
these observatories

1141
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Then what

1142
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
This fishing boat compared to

1143
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The location of any GPS point on land

1144
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
You can use the commonly used dynamic positioning

1145
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
to get

1146
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
what about

1147
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
fishing boats on the seabed

1148
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
relative position

1149
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It is to use deep wave positioning to obtain

1150
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
In this way we can know that

1151
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
any point on the seabed

1152
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Ways of motion relative to land

1153
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
what about now

1154
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
we are on the ground

1155
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
On our planet we now have two proving grounds

1156
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
One is in the far south of the Okinawa tide

1157
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
The water depth is about 1300 meters

1158
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
The other one is in Ryukyu

1159
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Near the Ryukyu Trench

1160
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The water depth is about 3800 meters

1161
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Then this study is actually a

1162
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It takes a lot of time and money to research

1163
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
because we have to observe

1164
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
long enough for some good

1165
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Research results can come out

1166
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,400
What does the deep wave responder look like

1167
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,080
Throw these instruments into the sea

1168
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,440
it is not recyclable

1169
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,200
So we have to be in

1170
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,960
Before the battery runs out

1171
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,880
Do research every year as much as possible

1172
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,080
Then get the most of these observations

1173
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,080
That's the case with our Offshore Instrumentation Department.

1174
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,400
And then we also have to measure the seawater

1175
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,680
compare its conductivity

1176
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,520
parameters such as temperature and pressure

1177
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,640
Because when we are doing deep wave positioning

1178
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,080
The speed at which this deep wave travels

1179
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,800
are related to these parameters

1180
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,760
So we also have to measure the relevant

1181
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,880
These physical parameters

1182
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,360
Then it's time to do our positioning

1183
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,880
do some commissioning

1184
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,760
That's when doing research

1185
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,000
In some states using various transfer funds

1186
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,800
In fact, doing this research is also very hard.

1187
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,400
Because it is mainly because of the signal of the deep wave

1188
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,240
it will be affected by the sound of the engine on this boat

1189
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,000
So usually we're doing

1190
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
when doing this research

1191
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,500
Just drive the boat to our target area

1192
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,000
Then turn off the engine and start drifting

1193
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,500
And then everyone is on 24-hour shifts

1194
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
and then go record those signals

1195
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,000
So what we usually do is

1196
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
24 hours is a shift, you have to go all the time

1197
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Constantly read data

1198
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,500
and what about the staff

1199
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,000
have to endure the harsh working environment on board

1200
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Because basically Taiwan's research ships are too sought-after

1201
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So we generally have to follow the general

1202
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
do ocean these

1203
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
When researchers go to compete this ship schedule

1204
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
actually quite difficult

1205
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
In the end we all chose fishing boats

1206
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
There are many bugs on the fishing boat

1207
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
So our colleagues often come back after

1208
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,500
Usually his feet are covered with red bean ice

1209
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,000
or lack of sleep

1210
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
It's actually a hard job

1211
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
what they did in the past

1212
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Nearly five years of research

1213
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It is not easy to finally have a comparison point

1214
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
is now everyone sees this

1215
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
white this arrow

1216
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It is this station exercise input field

1217
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Although it is only a station

1218
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
but we for

1219
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Collecting information on this site took a lot of effort

1220
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,640
Then we have another observatory that is

1221
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,800
This place closer to the trench

1222
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,840
Then of course we do this research to see

1223
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,880
close to the trench

1224
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,800
This fault is continuously creeping

1225
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,400
or is it locked

1226
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,800
if it keeps creeping

1227
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,880
that of course that is a good thing

1228
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,000
That is, its energy is continuously released

1229
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,560
but if it is locked

1230
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,000
still really

1231
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,640
some major settings

1232
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,800
in fact it is

1233
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,880
Can it be placed on the east coast

1234
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,000
Actually there are some

1235
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
some space to consider

1236
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Besides that we also

1237
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,200
The earth is like me, I also want to say

1238
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Set up the pressure level of this seabed

1239
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,400
Then this is the same as the seabed survey just now

1240
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,200
are complementary

1241
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
Because if the seabed is measured vigorously,

1242
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,480
when you have to observe

1243
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,680
will have information

1244
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,800
If the seabed pressure level

1245
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,400
itself is recyclable

1246
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,600
I can leave it for half a year

1247
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,200
Then I have the data for half a year

1248
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,800
Then go and observe this

1249
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,400
deformation on the seabed

1250
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,000
The principle of it is actually very simple

1251
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,120
it is in fact

1252
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,800
measure the water

1253
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,000
Because if the seabed deforms

1254
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,340
Then the depth of the sea water measured by this instrument will change.

1255
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,400
Then what

1256
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,840
The pressure of the cold test will change

1257
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,020
With this pressure difference, we can convert the deformation of Haishuang

1258
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,000
for example this

1259
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,680
Let this line be the position before deformation, the position of Haishuang before deformation

1260
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,480
Green is the deformed position

1261
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,840
Then I can see the pressure difference before deformation and the pressure difference after deformation

1262
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,440
Then guess how big the vertical deformation of this sea frost is

1263
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,240
That's usually 100 Pascale 100% change

1264
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,880
Like a deformation of about 1 cm

1265
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,040
So this instrument is very precise

1266
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,640
Then we hope that in the future we can cross the Ryukyu Trench to set up these instruments

1267
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,520
Then go to see some deformation behaviors near the Ryukyu Trench

1268
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,400
OK, let's wrap things up a little bit.

1269
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,360
Today we introduced several different methods to observe the deformation of the screen strip

1270
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,120
For example, there is this land

1271
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
GNSS

1272
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radar

1273
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
There's also a large ocean basin survey and a seabed piezometer.

1274
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We can go and observe the displacement of the surface

1275
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Estimation of the fault's Chinese tree rate

1276
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
and assess its potential future earthquake location

1277
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
with the scale

1278
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
If we want to know more distant events

1279
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
we can use sea connection

1280
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Or use the depth of the coral reef

1281
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
to see these older earthquake events

1282
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
tsunami words

1283
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
We can go to see the tsunami's results

1284
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
or a large boulder on the coast

1285
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Or look up some historical literature records

1286
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
To guess where the tsunami might occur

1287
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
The source of its corresponding tsunami

1288
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Or the relationship with the earthquake on the screen

1289
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We also introduce

1290
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
The way the screen strips the crust deforms

1291
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
During the block screen process

1292
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
before the earthquake

1293
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,640
The upper plate will slowly arch

1294
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,440
then move to land

1295
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,600
then after the earthquake

1296
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,600
it will generate dive

1297
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,240
Then move towards the sea

1298
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,040
Then we introduce

1299
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,400
That is, Huayi will be distributed everywhere on the fault

1300
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,640
before the earthquake

1301
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,240
Energy slowly in the depths of the fault

1302
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,600
accumulate slowly

1303
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,680
Then this may take hundreds to thousands of years

1304
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,640
But when the earthquake happened

1305
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,240
maybe 20 seconds to 30 seconds

1306
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,240
It can accumulate the past from hundreds to thousands of years

1307
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,880
These energies are released

1308
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,320
Therefore, there will be a large

1309
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,240
Rule shifts on these surfaces

1310
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,400
If after the earthquake

1311
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,160
In some places the energy has not been fully released

1312
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,480
then after the earthquake

1313
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,000
It will last this Huayi

1314
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,160
Then our Taiwan is now located in this place

1315
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,800
So let's study these screen strips now

1316
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,520
is actually very important

1317
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,760
because the screen has words

1318
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,600
For example, we study the Malayan Trench

1319
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,840
Then this is different from the Ryukyu Trench

1320
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,640
Because if the Ryukyu Trench ruptures,

1321
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,720
Its main energy is to

1322
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,440
The direction of the Pacific

1323
00:55:59,440 --> 00:55:59,960
but if

1324
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,800
If a rupture occurs in the Mara Trench

1325
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,600
It actually goes to the South China Sea

1326
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,800
Spread it to mainland China and the Indochina Peninsula

1327
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,400
So it's pretty obvious that it could actually be a disaster.

1328
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,800
So we are in Taiwan

1329
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,000
We near do these implicit bands with these observations

1330
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,280
In fact, these experiences we can all

1331
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,800
pass to these Southeast Asian countries

1332
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,000
then if we are here

1333
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,600
There are some better monitoring

1334
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,800
Assessment of Earthquake Hazards for the Whole Region

1335
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,800
In fact, it has a considerable contribution to prevention.

1336
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,000
In addition, we actually

1337
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,720
Attached to many of these in Taiwan

1338
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,960
Mimi Mama's GPS Observation Station

1339
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,560
Besides these observatories are used to do these

1340
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,800
scientific research

1341
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,560
Earthquakes used to study the silent zone

1342
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,720
In fact, it has a lot of added value

1343
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,160
For example, we actually

1344
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,120
These GPS Observation Stations in Taiwan

1345
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,920
we can study some

1346
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,920
The movement of these landslides in Taiwan

1347
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,880
For example, this is near Mount Lu

1348
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,200
Some GPS time series we set up

1349
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,920
Coordinates change over time

1350
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,040
This is from 2005 to 2014

1351
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,780
basic data

1352
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,620
This is the east-west and vertical components of the north-south component

1353
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,300
we can see

1354
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,140
when it rains heavily

1355
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,060
The process of slope rising into landslide sliding

1356
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,900
We want to use this information

1357
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,780
To learn about the mechanism of these landslides

1358
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,620
Is there any relationship between landslide sliding speed and rainfall?

1359
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,180
Are there any signs before the landslide slides?

1360
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,420
These can be observed from the surface

1361
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,220
do some inversion

1362
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,820
To understand the physical properties of landslide sliding surfaces

1363
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:38,900
Also see

1364
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,340
In fact, there are places in the landslide area that will still rise

1365
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,580
Let's say it's a slope

1366
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,500
In fact you can see

1367
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,820
What you see is that it's an upward movement

1368
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:48,980
everyone will feel

1369
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,180
Why Landslides Shouldn't Be

1370
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,540
everything slides down

1371
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,820
why is it elevated

1372
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,140
Mainly it is at the stop of landslides

1373
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,980
So it's a relatively quiet area

1374
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,100
So this place is a rising

1375
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
a deformation

1376
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,640
So in fact if we can have some dense observations

1377
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,320
We can also generate landslides or dive into landslides

1378
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,320
There are some nice constraints

1379
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,120
What are the benefits of the geophysical method?

1380
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,640
Mainly because of the geophysical method

1381
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,760
Our instruments are placed in the submerged or above the surface

1382
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,880
When traditional civil engineering is doing landslide monitoring

1383
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,400
they have to specialize

1384
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,320
Then go set up the inclinometer

1385
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,600
But everyone can know that

1386
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,360
if in a very active place

1387
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,400
that landslide

1388
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,840
landslide transport it is the effect of gravity

1389
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,680
So it's always slipping

1390
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,800
then you can think of

1391
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,560
If that it places everything after that hole is cut

1392
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,960
In fact it would have to make a new hole

1393
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,160
So now a one-meter brick neck costs about 8,000 yuan

1394
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,200
as you can imagine

1395
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,200
The entire hillside must be moved up

1396
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,320
For example, spending 200 million to 300 million yuan in Lisanping

1397
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,840
Then whole the slope

1398
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,520
But because this slope is very active

1399
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,160
Then this is a decorative instrument

1400
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,760
It's all unusable now

1401
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,760
Then if using this geophysical method

1402
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,520
The way we use these observations is in fact

1403
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,080
we can

1404
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,360
Can be detected by non-destructive methods

1405
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,400
Whether it's diving, it's scattered movement

1406
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,560
or these activities at the deep end

1407
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,200
can do it all

1408
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,160
Alternatively, we can also

1409
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,900
Do some assessment of water resources

1410
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,440
For example we see

1411
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,560
We have some consecutive

1412
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,240
These GPS stations

1413
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,440
Then we can see

1414
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,340
For example, in the vertical

1415
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,360
it has some obvious

1416
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,300
agglomeration of changes

1417
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,540
it goes up and down

1418
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,840
It Long term will have a coupon

1419
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,060
It's about, maybe about the Tectonic

1420
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,060
But there will be some fluctuations in its build-up

1421
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:29,900
those fluctuations

1422
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,760
It's actually the groundwater below.

1423
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,200
Or it is related to the amount of cold water in the soil

1424
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Then we can actually use

1425
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,140
It's our GPS

1426
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,960
into these collective governments

1427
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,660
to calculate in these soils

1428
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:43,960
amount of cold water

1429
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,300
Then for this entire

1430
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,800
Regional Water Resources Assessment

1431
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,960
actually helps

1432
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,900
the last one is

1433
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,600
We do a lot of work in travel

1434
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,660
This is our trip to send in 2009

1435
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,560
Then when we went over there to set up the station

1436
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,600
this is an elementary school

1437
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,000
everyone is very very nice

1438
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
why we do this

1439
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So we are laying out while

1440
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Also explain to these children

1441
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
The purpose of our observation

1442
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
so this is actually quite interesting

1443
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
we are there

1444
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Tell them about our work

1445
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And then use it to nurture their next generation

1446
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Okay, thank you

1447
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Okay, thank you very much, Dr. Hsu

1448
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
give us a very good speech

1449
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
the rest of our time now

1450
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
open to audience questions

1451
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
About the content of the speech

1452
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Which point would I like to have a deeper understanding of

1453
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Or think of some good suggestions

1454
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
or a problem

1455
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Please ask questions

1456
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Thanks

1457
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Thanks

1458
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Thanks

1459
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Thanks

1460
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Thanks

1461
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I won't talk about big questions, please actively raise them

1462
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
What about our sponsor today?

1463
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Prepared some products

1464
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
he now we have

1465
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
October of this year

1466
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,380
The two staff members of Scientist held him up

1467
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,960
do we have 6 or 7

1468
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:16,900
We can give it to the audience friends who asked questions in front of the head

1469
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,720
we ask everyone to raise their hands right now

1470
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,020
there's a microphone in front of you

1471
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,340
so there's a switch that's the green switch

1472
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,420
so when you can speak into the microphone

1473
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,980
Is there anyone who wants to start

1474
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,620
good lady

1475
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,400
ask the professor

1476
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,480
We seem to be the one in the reputation zone

1477
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,320
101 belongs to the earthquake zone, right?

1478
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,380
that said besides saying

1479
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,500
Is there anything beyond our possible detection

1480
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,580
prevent it from happening to him thank you

1481
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
So we know that means

1482
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
If we're on the new TV if we make some

1483
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
After water injection, it will cause some local changes in India

1484
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Will change the situation in the local Indy

1485
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
then maybe

1486
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
is to make the earthquake happen earlier or later

1487
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
but now what i think

1488
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
It should be difficult to artificially

1489
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,000
do some action

1490
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
so that this earthquake does not happen

1491
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Yes it is more difficult

1492
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It would be better to find a way to take care of the house.

1493
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
This is actually in Canada they

1494
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
In western Canada they actually have a lot of oil and gas development

1495
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that's or something they'll pick

1496
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
They use some drip heat and he might have to pour water into it

1497
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Then they found that when the water is injected, it will lead to life, that is, it will cause a lot of small droplet vibrations

1498
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
What about these small droplet shocks, for some, are

1499
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
He might just be an energy release character

1500
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
But it's also possible that he'll make some of the fault zone's drip quake

1501
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
It couldn't have happened so soon, it happened earlier

1502
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
So now when you intervene, some will be good and some will be bad

1503
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
It's hard for you to go because we don't know now

1504
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
fault his own coin is in what state

1505
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So you don't know if you're good or bad for the area after you do this movement

1506
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Yes, because some of them may have already crossed the boundary

1507
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
All you need is a small trace, some changes in coins

1508
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
You'll make him have a big tick

1509
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
some if it's still far away, you might do something

1510
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
won't let him, just no, in fact he won't have any changes

1511
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So this is actually because seismologists or earth dancers

1512
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Now the biggest one, the problem is

1513
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
for faulting his coin

1514
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,500
In fact, we don't know the state of India on the fault.

1515
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,640
All we know is that the earthquake happened and India will change

1516
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,840
But we don't know what its Indian state was in its original state

1517
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,680
Because the recovery period of the earthquake is very long

1518
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,580
So we say that we need to understand the process of an earthquake

1519
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:20,520
In fact, only from the past 100 years or the last 20 or 30 years

1520
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,920
this is insufficient

1521
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,760
right

1522
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,480
Okay, thank you

1523
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,860
So it's still unknown

1524
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,360
quite difficult for the present

1525
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,160
right

1526
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:29,820
Thanks

1527
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:33,460
well the lady is behind

1528
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,400
i want to ask

1529
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,660
I was just curious

1530
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:41,400
Just got the orange one that can measure pressure

1531
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,900
The one you said can only be used once

1532
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,480
Then I want to ask how long it can last

1533
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:51,340
In addition, on that land, measurement is prediction

1534
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:56,340
It is the part to measure the possible slippage of the earthquake

1535
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,720
That's because the geology of each place is different

1536
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,080
that includes it underground possibly

1537
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,600
there may be some that flow by themselves

1538
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,600
For example, groundwater or some

1539
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,500
It's like comparing minerals, fluid minerals, etc.

1540
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,100
Will it be like this

1541
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:13,100
Would it interfere with you measuring that

1542
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,800
just maybe it's slipping on the plate

1543
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,100
Or something related to earthquake prediction

1544
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:19,600
Thanks

1545
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,200
The instrument just mentioned

1546
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,600
That one-time instrument is dependent on the battery

1547
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,900
how long the battery lasts

1548
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,000
if we have a good battery

1549
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,600
it can last five to ten years

1550
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,400
right

1551
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,600
But if, for example, the instrument

1552
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,300
Sometimes there are problems because

1553
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,400
when we set up

1554
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,500
maybe some sea breakers

1555
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,100
it sometimes buries that instrument

1556
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,600
Then let's send the deep wave signal

1557
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,700
when it's time to wake up to work

1558
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,800
maybe there is no way

1559
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,400
We will just because if it is buried after

1560
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,800
it may be difficult

1561
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,700
That instrument may not be useful

1562
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,200
Because there are actually some

1563
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,700
some subsea avalanches

1564
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,900
Then if we don't when it's time to deploy

1565
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,560
Maybe the position of the one-flag spin is not good enough

1566
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,680
there will be such a situation

1567
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,840
Basically its life is related to the battery

1568
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,920
If we can buy a good battery

1569
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,400
Basically it can last five to ten years

1570
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,320
Another question is that

1571
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,320
If some of the signals we see are related to groundwater

1572
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,680
Could it be related to the news-making of these environments?

1573
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,960
indeed it will

1574
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,880
How do we distinguish

1575
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,320
That is to say, it is related to the environment

1576
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,400
or we measured these terranes

1577
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,000
Signals of activity on these faults

1578
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,280
the first is to say

1579
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,560
when we have this doubt

1580
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,840
we will collect

1581
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,560
That place, for example, water level data, gas tank data

1582
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,000
Then do the comparison

1583
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,160
and then go and take all of these neighbors

1584
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,480
The behavior of the test stations is used for comparison

1585
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,840
look it is very

1586
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:45,920
Local refers to the local behavior or the behavior of a large area

1587
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:48,000
Then we can clarify

1588
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,440
this behavior is

1589
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,840
more local or regional

1590
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,040
Then it may have something to do with the environment

1591
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,560
But this requires dissection

1592
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,800
and you need to collect a lot of different data

1593
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,160
That is indeed the data

1594
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
If it were possible for observers on the surface to record these inquiries about these environments

1595
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Excuse me Dr. Xu

1596
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Which areas around Taipei are areas with fault zones?

1597
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Now, what kind of monitoring is the government doing?

1598
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and some information to inform the public

1599
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Thanks

1600
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
In fact, the main active fault in Taiwan

1601
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
In fact, the Geographical Information Survey Institute has declassified

1602
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It has different active faults and different levels

1603
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Then each has a different definition

1604
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Well, there are actually some monitors on these faults.

1605
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
There is regular monitoring data

1606
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
like some of these gps jean is

1607
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Why is his job continuous Zhan is to monitor

1608
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It is to continuously monitor the deformation of these surfaces.

1609
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But now the difficulty is to say that the fault precedes the activity

1610
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Everyone pays attention to the front move phenomenon on him.

1611
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But the former move is actually very concerned in the world at present

1612
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,020
It is the observation of the frontlight phenomenon of earthquakes

1613
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:06,020
In fact, there has been no major breakthrough

1614
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,020
because of the considerable difficulty

1615
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,020
So while we monitor

1616
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,020
But we do monitor the data

1617
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:15,020
it can tell you

1618
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:19,020
Areas of possible future rupture

1619
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:20,020
probably somewhere

1620
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,020
But it is difficult for us to tell you exactly

1621
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:24,020
what time is it going to happen

1622
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,020
it's more difficult

1623
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,020
there are three here

1624
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,020
this way first

1625
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,020
Dr. Hsu, thank you for talking about this

1626
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,020
let us know something

1627
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,020
I just want to ask

1628
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,020
can you add some

1629
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:45,020
Which legends are more scientifically based?

1630
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,020
For example, the appearance of Emperor Yu represents the occurrence of an earthquake.

1631
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:50,020
Or biological changes

1632
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:53,020
Or something that has no scientific basis

1633
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,020
Let us in our ordinary life

1634
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:58,020
There is also some will to judge

1635
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,600
At noon they are for creatures when the earthquake comes

1636
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,400
they did a lot of research

1637
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,600
My own reaction to this creature actually

1638
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,600
because if you want to include these as earthquake precursors

1639
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,920
That's every time these animals have these reactions

1640
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,720
you will have an earthquake

1641
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,480
right

1642
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:24,320
If we only look at the earthquake precursors now, then we can say in hindsight

1643
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,920
Our cat didn't sleep before this earthquake or something

1644
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,920
so it's kind of like

1645
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,120
It's because you're an afterthought

1646
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,800
If we really want to study precursors we have to be

1647
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,640
what is the normal behavior of this animal

1648
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,400
That is, he can correspond to an earthquake every time there is an abnormality

1649
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,040
But if this cannot be established

1650
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,680
It's hard for you to convince others to say

1651
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,160
my creature

1652
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,200
This starts with some behaviors of some animals

1653
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,760
can be used to predict earthquakes

1654
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,920
right

1655
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,920
so

1656
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:59,920
Some can, some can't, probably not

1657
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
hundred percent

1658
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:01,760
right

1659
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,760
it's hard to be sure

1660
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,240
Because this is not the same as forecasting weather

1661
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,040
Actually something is different

1662
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,440
Because if the earthquake is predicted

1663
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,840
If you keep saying the earthquake is coming

1664
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,840
earthquake is coming

1665
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,640
You didn't even come

1666
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,000
The next time you say an earthquake is coming

1667
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,120
everyone stop running

1668
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:14,720
OK

1669
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,040
At this time, if an earthquake strikes

1670
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,280
it will be very serious

1671
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,280
So if your climate forecast is inaccurate

1672
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,640
That's actually

1673
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,440
The consequences would be less severe

1674
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,680
Compared with earthquake prediction

1675
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:26,520
So earthquake prediction actually has

1676
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,080
quite a long way to go

1677
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,280
ok get ready

1678
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,680
hello please ask

1679
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,520
that volcano erupted

1680
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,480
Will it drive that fault zone to rupture?

1681
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,200
Is there a causal relationship between them?

1682
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,720
like that

1683
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,920
Kameyama is old and quite close to the Ryukyu Trench

1684
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,160
For example, the Tatun Volcanic Society

1685
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,960
next to it is the one

1686
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:48,920
Mountain Foot Fault

1687
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,880
Is there any kind of

1688
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,840
cause and effect thank you

1689
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,360
it is indeed possible

1690
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:55,200
because like

1691
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,520
2016 Yumoto Earthquake, Japan

1692
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,760
it is it yumoto earthquake

1693
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,040
that earthquake

1694
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,880
It actually happened on the south side of Aso Volcano

1695
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,200
But after that earthquake

1696
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,000
Volcanoes have some relatively violent activities

1697
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,040
On the contrary

1698
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,600
Because you just have some movement of these earthquakes or volcanoes

1699
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,120
It will cause changes in Indonesia in that area

1700
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,720
That does have the potential to trigger activity on nearby faults.

1701
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,000
there is this possibility

1702
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,720
the student

1703
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,920
The student I want to consult is my first department

1704
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,920
Then I noticed that some instruments introduced just now are

1705
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,040
put it over there

1706
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,040
and maybe a year later

1707
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,440
Look at the data it collects

1708
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,880
what i want to ask is

1709
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,320
Earthquake early warning systems are now available at

1710
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,160
after the earthquake has occurred

1711
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,840
Send alerts to people's mobile phones

1712
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,320
Then I want to ask if there is any instrument

1713
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,360
continuous monitoring

1714
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,200
Then minutes before a possible earthquake,

1715
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,840
forecast

1716
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:56,800
this may be difficult

1717
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:57,960
just with everyone

1718
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,520
I just told you the same

1719
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:00,040
that is

1720
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,700
Because what kind of so-called precursor phenomenon will occur before the earthquake

1721
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:09,260
Because we don't see many such cases now

1722
01:12:09,260 --> 01:12:12,820
Presumably there are successful predictions in the literature

1723
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:14,700
That is, there was a successful early warning before the earthquake.

1724
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:16,020
Actually Haicheng Earthquake

1725
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,560
It should be that the Haicheng earthquake in 1976 was successful

1726
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,600
All other earthquakes are not recognized by scientists

1727
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,560
was successful

1728
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,500
so honestly

1729
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,520
What to do before an earthquake

1730
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,600
Actually we don't know

1731
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,120
Again because of this relationship

1732
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,160
So it is difficult for you to say that before the earthquake

1733
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,920
Hurry up and tell everyone that an earthquake is about to happen

1734
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,520
Actually it's quite difficult

1735
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,840
Earthquake warning means

1736
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,200
If your earthquake is far away from you

1737
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,120
that it happened now

1738
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,320
Because it takes a while for the wave to reach you

1739
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,880
so if you get farther away from you

1740
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,400
You'll have more time to make early warnings

1741
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,040
like a tsunami

1742
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,120
Because the tsunami propagation speed may be hundreds of kilometers per hour

1743
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,020
So if you compare earthquakes that occur farther away

1744
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:58,140
you know it happened

1745
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:00,140
That's because the wave spread to Taiwan may be

1746
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,600
It takes a while, then you may have tens of seconds and minutes

1747
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,500
or have an hour left to do these preparations

1748
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:08,800
But what if it happened near Taiwan?

1749
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,600
In fact, because it waves the boat because the distance is very close

1750
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,300
So you soon this burrow will come

1751
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,800
You might be too late to run, right?

1752
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,800
It was just said that one was admitted to predict success

1753
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,100
Then why was that scene predictable?

1754
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:27,200
because its symptoms are obvious, yes

1755
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,800
What are the signs?

1756
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,500
it was just before the earthquake

1757
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,300
it has some noticeable deformation

1758
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,000
Crustal deformation, they did some leveling

1759
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,700
For vertical traces of two layers of earth

1760
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,200
it found some obvious changes

1761
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,800
And before the earthquake

1762
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,400
it has foreshocks it has dense foreshocks

1763
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,900
There are dense earthquakes, small earthquakes, yes

1764
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,400
Then this is the beginning, the warning

1765
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,000
Yes please evacuate

1766
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,100
That earthquake was a success, yes

1767
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,820
But the long mountain in the back is right behind

1768
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,600
Also nearby. That one didn't work out.

1769
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:05,620
right

1770
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:06,920
so

1771
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,220
Controversy is still quite big

1772
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,260
ok sir

1773
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,200
I want to ask Dr. Xu about the recent neutral blog

1774
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:21,760
Neutral betting is gravitational betting

1775
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,560
get the nobel prize

1776
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,120
I've seen this before

1777
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,420
Earth's electric plane may be

1778
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:29,440
predict

1779
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,220
like this last generation

1780
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,520
this possibility

1781
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,840
Does Professor Xu have any information on this?

1782
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,660
About our power layer

1783
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,960
The onboard power layer is predictable

1784
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,240
our earthquake

1785
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,800
Well, yesterday I saw a message saying

1786
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:47,360
This golden heel on earth

1787
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,160
radiation of copper

1788
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,960
when the volcano erupts

1789
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:55,300
Might be able to see that radiation beneath us

1790
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,580
that radiation

1791
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,120
that creates the geographic layer

1792
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:58,880
electric wire

1793
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,340
The atmosphere, the electrotransfer layer, should have followed the atmosphere

1794
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:07,820
These changes are important for us to predict earthquakes

1795
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,740
Is there any current scientific evidence

1796
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,700
For the electrotransfer layer

1797
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,540
An old hole created by an earthquake in the electrotransfer layer

1798
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,140
Indeed, some can be observed online

1799
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,080
But just like I said earlier

1800
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,700
In fact such an old hole line like this

1801
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,040
It happens even when there are no earthquakes

1802
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,900
becomes saying that if we really want to use this

1803
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,600
Help come and go to understand the pre-creation of earthquakes

1804
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,240
we have to explain

1805
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,540
What kind of abnormal phenomena

1806
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:39,980
Could all these anomalies lead to an earthquake?

1807
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,660
but if there is no

1808
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:44,560
how high is your accuracy

1809
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,060
For example because if you are generally right or wrong

1810
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:48,360
just a normal chance

1811
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,060
So I think your accuracy

1812
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,940
at least seventy percent

1813
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,440
It can be said that it is more feasible

1814
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,700
Because you guessed it was normal

1815
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:00,200
That's at least what you're going to do if you're going to use this method

1816
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,600
Regardless of the method, when you learn about earthquake prediction

1817
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,000
So can you reach this threshold?

1818
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It's not that everyone is talking about it after the earthquake

1819
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
i see this which i see

1820
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
This becomes less scientifically based.

1821
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
ok here's another question

1822
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Ask Dr. Xu

1823
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Because I do avoidable things with my kids

1824
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
We must be very interested in observing the natural environment

1825
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
A few years ago we went to the Zhenyang point of Jiufen 23

1826
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Want to see a lot of wet damage protruding from the ground

1827
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
We don't quite understand what kind of power this is

1828
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
what kind of action

1829
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
where does its history come from

1830
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
would stick out the surface so much moisture damage

1831
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Can Dr. Hsu tell us, please?

1832
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Wet damage Because of wet damage, it is usually when you are at noon

1833
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And because of that low relationship

1834
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
It is the action of the water flow that creates

1835
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,320
The death loss was how it was lifted up from the ground before

1836
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,700
Because as far as I know there shouldn't be

1837
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,300
Limestone

1838
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:12,120
So there should be no casualties.

1839
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,320
That might not necessarily be a death loss

1840
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,560
For example, if you eat lightly

1841
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,960
For example, if you say rock

1842
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,360
If your rock composition has strong and weak

1843
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:35,020
That's because if it's exposed to the surface

1844
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,320
because of your rain

1845
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,220
it washes out some of the weaker rocks first

1846
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:42,320
the harder stuff stays there

1847
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,020
Then maybe it will produce a shape like this

1848
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,720
ok wait a minute

1849
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,800
Is there anything else here?

1850
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:53,720
the lady

1851
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,880
Have been to the Taichung Science and Technology Museum

1852
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,000
they have an address delay

1853
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,840
That's because of the plate movement we've seen before

1854
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,000
It's all because of Zhang Lie at the central level

1855
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,040
then push the plate

1856
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,680
make plates collide

1857
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,200
Then the ocean can be silent

1858
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,920
But its new saying is that

1859
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,760
Because the plate on the edge of the plate is older

1860
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,640
so it cools

1861
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,520
It becomes denser after cooling

1862
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,640
so it's silent

1863
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,960
and because of its obscurity

1864
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,320
Only then did he pull Zhang Lie at the central level behind him

1865
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,400
Then my new way of speaking

1866
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,320
because i haven't heard of it before

1867
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,120
In that exercise, it was talking about this

1868
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:47,200
so i don't know what the doctor said about this

1869
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,400
move with the old plate

1870
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,680
It was promoted by Zhang Lie at the central level

1871
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,840
plate collision

1872
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:57,680
Then keep quiet about which one would make more sense.

1873
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,640
No both exist

1874
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,700
Because the tiles are generated when the Central Group

1875
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,500
It just pushes the oceanic plate to the side

1876
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,300
Then the final process is due to the relationship of gravity

1877
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:10,500
It actually brings the plates down

1878
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,900
So both forces work

1879
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,900
both work

1880
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,100
It's just that the place of action is different

1881
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:22,200
But it's all driven by plate movement

1882
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,500
both have always been

1883
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,900
because it was emphatically saying

1884
01:19:27,700 --> 01:19:32,500
In fact, it is not the central set that pushes the plates to collide

1885
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,700
It's that the central set was pulled apart after the plates disappeared.

1886
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:38,900
It has been emphasized that the point is

1887
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:42,700
Concealing first and centering pulling out later

1888
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,500
I'm not sure which of these two forces contributes more

1889
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,100
But at least all I knew was

1890
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,600
Both forces are plate action

1891
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:56,400
It is the driving force provided by the plate movement

1892
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I remember Zhang Lie very much

1893
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
that is

1894
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
The implicit contribution is also

1895
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
that's right

1896
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
it's you

1897
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
it's you

1898
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
when the earth culverts upwards

1899
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
he will put

1900
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Both active and passive

1901
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
right

1902
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
then when silent

1903
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
because of gravity

1904
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
he would have been down

1905
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
so he'll pull it down

1906
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So these two effects

1907
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
should have both

1908
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
OK thank you

1909
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
ok there's one behind

1910
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Hello Dr. Xu

1911
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I'm a postdoc at that autobiographical center

1912
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
He wants to consult with Dr.

1913
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
just say

1914
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
like the one just now

1915
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
the one under the ground

1916
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Sensing instrument

1917
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
is that possible

1918
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
like tie a rope

1919
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Then

1920
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
wait till it's decided

1921
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
pull it up like this

1922
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,000
reuse

1923
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I have no idea

1924
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And then there is that

1925
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,000
just saw it

1926
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
under the sea

1927
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
just dive

1928
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
dive down

1929
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
to measure

1930
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
His lower status

1931
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
in this way

1932
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
will that be that

1933
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
In case of the influence of that tide

1934
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
would be less accurate like this

1935
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Still flat

1936
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Rise and fall

1937
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
The last one is to say

1938
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Just now the doctor announced the dynamic changes of the tsunami

1939
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Will there be a typhoon at that time?

1940
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Will it have some influence on him?

1941
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,000
For example, it may increase the speed of the wave boat or something.

1942
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Thanks

1943
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
ok i try to remember all your questions

1944
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Can the first one be tied with a rope?

1945
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
of course not

1946
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
because i think you should be

1947
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Actually, I don't know if you have ever engaged in marine activities.

1948
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Because our instruments are at least ten or twenty kilograms

1949
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Then you put in the water to a depth of 2,000 meters

1950
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
basically you can't

1951
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Because that resistance is too great

1952
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:46,000
In fact, as long as you are about tens of meters, you are fine.

1953
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
One or two hundred meters is OK

1954
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But 4,000 meters is very difficult

1955
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
so it is impossible to tie the rope

1956
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
We're now actually going to have an aluminum ground setup

1957
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
That means after we sink the instrument to the bottom of the ocean now

1958
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Then let's say we turn off the car

1959
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,300
Then when the time comes we'll hand it over

1960
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,400
Then it will have a

1961
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,600
Ruins' device

1962
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,900
so it will float up

1963
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,100
And then it will flash when it comes up

1964
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:08,900
then we can

1965
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,100
find where this instrument is

1966
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,900
But our instruments are sometimes taken away by Yunming

1967
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,500
Then blackmail us like this

1968
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,800
Hehehe

1969
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,200
right then

1970
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,900
next thing you said

1971
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,700
Well

1972
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,100
Will it be affected by tides?

1973
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,900
The tide is changing because of the tide

1974
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:23,500
it is cycle

1975
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:24,700
it is recoverable

1976
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:25,400
That

1977
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,600
This deformation of the earth is irreversible

1978
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,200
So it is easy to distinguish

1979
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,500
and the tidal cycle

1980
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,400
The main cycle is 12 hours

1981
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,000
Well

1982
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,800
just uh

1983
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,300
12 hours 20 hours

1984
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:36,800
Its several Modes are

1985
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,400
do you know how often it is

1986
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,700
So basically you're not going to talk to the normal

1987
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,400
Earthquake or plate movement signal

1988
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,400
is mixed together

1989
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,300
because of the tide

1990
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,900
Our human study of tides

1991
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:49,200
Scientists have thoroughly studied tides

1992
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,300
It's all these Mode it

1993
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,000
it has

1994
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,600
how much each frequency

1995
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,100
have very detailed records

1996
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:57,100
then you say

1997
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,700
when the typhoon comes

1998
01:22:58,700 --> 01:22:59,700
if there is a tsunami

1999
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Will the typhoon affect the tsunami?

2000
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Then I want to answer yes

2001
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Tsunamis are very different from typhoons

2002
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
because of the tsunami

2003
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's because of the sea worm's misalignment

2004
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
so you whole sea worm

2005
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
The one where all of the above seawater happens

2006
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
are affected by fluctuations

2007
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
But the general sea breeze

2008
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
It's just that the sea water is very submerged.

2009
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
you will be affected

2010
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
but you won't affect deep

2011
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So your typhoon is actually a comparative

2012
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
surface movement

2013
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
But the tsunami is a deep movement

2014
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
So why can it spread so

2015
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
it can actually span the entire pacific

2016
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
For example, an earthquake reaching the sea of ââSouth America

2017
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
its tsunami could travel to japan

2018
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Is it because it is a holistic movement

2019
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Then because your sea worm is comparing the ocean

2020
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Because the water is deeper

2021
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
When it reaches the land, its sea water

2022
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
that sea worm will become shallow

2023
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
So the wave height of your tsunami will become higher

2024
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
like a water gun

2025
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
will cause great harm

2026
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So the typhoon should not affect

2027
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Trump's Slave

2028
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:03,780
good

2029
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,480
ok if there is no question i would like to ask a question

2030
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,440
you just saw taiwan

2031
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,960
our island

2032
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,480
Lots and lots of that GPS

2033
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,800
How many stations are there?

2034
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,360
Now there are more than 400

2035
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,440
400 means all of you all

2036
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,280
different units

2037
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,920
More than 400 units put up

2038
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,800
Then what we have is longer

2039
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:28,880
put it long ago

2040
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,440
Some are relatively new

2041
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,200
then we know that now

2042
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,320
These instruments are more and more advanced

2043
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,000
because everyone's mobile phone

2044
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,800
the GPS one

2045
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,440
The sensitivity is getting higher and higher

2046
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,520
Then

2047
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,320
because of your measurement

2048
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,280
you don't need to know every second

2049
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,440
You measure it about once a day

2050
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,080
calibration primary

2051
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,040
take one

2052
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,680
data is enough

2053
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,840
Then our current chip

2054
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,280
that more and more

2055
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,800
It may be getting smaller and smaller

2056
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,520
Power consumption is getting less and less

2057
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,880
Then it can be released indefinitely sometimes

2058
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,840
Needless to say, people have to peel the grass

2059
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,200
go find that thing

2060
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,120
we can know around there

2061
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,960
Then use the side of your instrument to put that

2062
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,000
All the signals are passed on

2063
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,120
The things in its memory can be passed here.

2064
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,920
Are you going this way now?

2065
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,160
It's very convenient if you go this way

2066
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,400
unnecessary

2067
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,120
We don't need hard-working students

2068
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,320
Go to every deep mountain to dig up the grass

2069
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,640
You can be within a few meters of that

2070
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,040
You can catch that signal

2071
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,640
Or let it go to the base station to go to the whole

2072
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,560
That is to say, we can digitize it as soon as possible.

2073
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,360
Then this we can go to

2074
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,000
This data will be more convenient to obtain

2075
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,520
Because in fact because of the mountains

2076
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,640
Mountains are the worst place for communications

2077
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,280
Because Chunghwa Telecom is a place where people live

2078
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,400
good communication quality

2079
01:25:56,440 --> 01:25:59,360
The situation in the mountains where no one lives is actually very bad

2080
01:25:59,360 --> 01:25:59,960
so

2081
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Maybe in cities or major cities

2082
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,500
Your cell phone coverage is actually pretty good

2083
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,000
But after going to the mountains, there are actually big problems

2084
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
In fact, we encountered a big problem in the transmission in the mountainous area

2085
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Even if we have recorded

2086
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
But the signal can't come out, people still have to go there

2087
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
this is a problem

2088
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
In addition to that

2089
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Because we do confidential positioning

2090
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
then we have to know

2091
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,500
We have to have some control points on the surface

2092
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,000
That point cannot be moved

2093
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,500
because what we need to know is to say

2094
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,500
Its change over time today

2095
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:39,000
So if our mobile phone can be used as a Receiver

2096
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Become means its position every time

2097
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
is to be in a fixed position

2098
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
still have to fix

2099
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,500
just its electron

2100
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,500
Its components will get smaller and smaller

2101
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:53,000
Could it be that this instrument will get better and better?

2102
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Of course, the instruments are getting smaller and smaller

2103
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It will be more convenient for us to do field work

2104
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
but that is to say

2105
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,500
If we want to make good progress on positioning

2106
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,180
very precise

2107
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,200
then we wish to say

2108
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,280
where everything is placed

2109
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,640
That point is not moving

2110
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:05,780
But if I measure today

2111
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:07,480
I may be a little crooked

2112
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,980
or if it is not quite right

2113
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,420
Maybe my coordinates are not so precise

2114
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,160
That's because of the map and deformation we're looking at

2115
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,520
is very tiny

2116
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,760
That kind of error is actually very difficult

2117
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,320
just not allowed

2118
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,160
right

2119
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,360
so i see your picture

2120
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,200
You want three corners to stand over there

2121
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,260
very fixed

2122
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:26,460
It must be very stable to put something on it

2123
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:27,800
Yes, just keep calm

2124
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:28,640
and we have that

2125
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,340
to that spherical position

2126
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,080
Then the height should be measured accurately

2127
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,280
And it takes a long time

2128
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:34,580
because from

2129
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:35,280
Actually that's it

2130
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,520
Because your car generally uses these positioning

2131
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,380
Maybe a few meters error

2132
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:40,980
but we sat

2133
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:42,020
Kilometer error

2134
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:43,960
So that level is much different

2135
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:44,920
So we rely on

2136
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,700
Good instrument and long-term implementation

2137
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,360
Then there is a way to achieve

2138
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,060
The progress of this positioning of the minimeter

2139
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:53,060
right

2140
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,300
It should be possible in the future

2141
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,440
Because we actually have some

2142
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,040
cheaper receiver

2143
01:27:59,040 --> 01:27:59,980
that is

2144
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,600
become smaller and smaller

2145
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,340
But it's small words that become words

2146
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:06,140
You want to spread a large area

2147
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:08,240
That is, the distance between your sides should be shortened.

2148
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,840
Then the observation time will be longer

2149
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:10,940
Density is going to be higher

2150
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:14,840
So it's hatchback to balance

2151
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,040
right

2152
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,680
And I just said that we are laying things on the bottom of the sea

2153
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:25,980
And because it goes through a lot of sea water on it

2154
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:28,980
So it transmits this GPS signal

2155
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:30,520
can't get out of this sea

2156
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,220
so you're going to use deep wave on the side

2157
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:38,520
to talk to it to test it

2158
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,520
Why is this measurement

2159
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,120
because you are near the United States

2160
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:46,180
You just have a few boards down there

2161
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:51,560
It takes 24 hours to pick up this signal

2162
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:53,920
Because in seawater it actually

2163
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,660
Because the sea itself is always moving

2164
01:28:55,660 --> 01:28:57,220
So its own

2165
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:00,100
It's the deep wave transmission

2166
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,800
When it comes up, it is that the change of deep wave speed will be quite large.

2167
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,640
Because it is different from yours, such as the temperature of sea water, there will be some changes

2168
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:10,320
And then the walrus changes, and these are the sources of the so-called errors

2169
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:14,880
Let's just say, what if we can collect as many observations as possible?

2170
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,560
We can try to eliminate these errors as much as possible.

2171
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,000
Because it's inside because there are a lot of internal waves in the sea

2172
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,560
These things are difficult for you to eliminate with models

2173
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,960
The only way is if you observe long enough

2174
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:34,240
And then because the path between your two deep waves to that ship is similar

2175
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:39,680
Then you can use the differential method to slightly eliminate these signals

2176
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,280
But if you want to achieve good observation progress

2177
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:45,080
Or the more observations, the better

2178
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:48,880
Or you use two boats and put that cost cost

2179
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,480
This is a matter of cost and popularity

2180
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,480
Yes because we do now, do this sea word

2181
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,840
Basically, the wind and waves are sometimes very strong

2182
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,040
Many people have at least half

2183
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
probably not working at sea

2184
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Yes, because we do this

2185
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,500
you have work to do at sea

2186
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,000
so you have to keep

2187
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
is working

2188
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
no cloud boat
