00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Fish sex, behavior, physiology and genes

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
that today's speaker

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What about Dr. Yan Hongyang?

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am a former and late classmate of the Zoology Department of National Taiwan University

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Usually juniors are older than seniors

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To come to a higher achievement

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so our teacher

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This teacher Liao Yijiu is here

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I said we are very happy today

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This illegitimate three can get together

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Where is Yan Hongyang?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He entered the Zoology Department of National Taiwan University in 1970

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
One page biology set

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that he because he has a good

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
great preference

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So there is summer vacation in my spare time

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They are all in the laboratories of many teachers.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Also in the water laboratory

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Break up and do various internships

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,760
After retiring from the army, he took the exam

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
I passed the college entrance examination

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
At that time we were going to take the college entrance examination

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
It's not easy

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,480
Because there are very few places in the college entrance examination

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,880
Red Oxygen was admitted immediately

37
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,320
I remember I graduated from the Zoology Department of National Taiwan University

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,680
to the Institute of Public Health

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,320
After graduation, I took the college entrance examination and failed many times.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,800
So he's better than me

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
that that

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
Later he entered the Institute of Oceanography

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Master's Office

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,600
engaged in the private placement in the description

45
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,520
Basic Biological Research

46
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,480
After graduation, I will return to the senior laboratory

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,640
Donggang Branch

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,280
as a technical researcher

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,360
engaged in fish and shrimp

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,240
Physiological studies of osmotic ducks

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,760
1980 to

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,080
Institute of Zoology of our Academia Sinica

53
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,800
work as an assistant

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,880
He has made a great contribution to Taiwan

55
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,080
Everyone can see this information

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,240
It was to assist the Royal Academicians at that time

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,680
This Dr. Colin Nicholl

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,240
To prove this fragrance from Taiwan

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
Rice without adding artificial fluorescent machine

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,720
So reversed the industry

61
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,480
This is really a great contribution to Taiwanese fishermen

62
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,280
in August 1981

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,840
He went to the branch campus in Austin, Texas, USA

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,560
Read zoology read this fish evolutionary ecology

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,920
Later to Mariland

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,600
Postdoctoral training on sensory neurophysiology of fish

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,160
In 1993, he taught in the Biology Department of the University of Kentucky

68
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,800
He is a very good teacher and he is good at teaching

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
so everyone can see

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,200
In 1997, he received the Teaching Excellence Award from the Biology Department of Kentucky University

71
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Received Great Teacher in 2000

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,880
Too Old Teacher Great Teacher Award

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,560
So we can see his skill in class

74
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,800
Returned to Taiwan in September 2004

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,480
Delivery in Yilan of our Academia Sinica

76
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,600
Linhai Research Station Research

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,320
This research work is about the physiology of vision and cleansing nerves of fish, shrimp and crabs produced in Taiwan

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,780
And its behavior and genetic sequencing and expression

79
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,580
It's all cutting-edge research

80
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,140
It is also the Taiwan Ocean University

81
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,820
Institute of Fisheries Science, National Taiwan University

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,880
Then, the combined professor of the Department of Oceanography of China Business University and the Institute of Biotechnology of Iran University

83
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,480
Carry forward his specialization in academic research

84
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,040
And the performance is quite excellent

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,200
More importantly, he is also very active in science popularization

86
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,640
And besides what he wrote here

87
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,500
In addition to being featured in this one Science Man Magazine Science Monthly

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,640
publish many articles

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,480
Also frequently featured in the National Library's New Books Monthly

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,340
Write many book reviews on aquatic fish and marine biology books

91
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,320
More importantly, he often gives popular science speeches

92
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
promote this scientific knowledge

93
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,960
There is a very important lecture series at National Taiwan University called Palm Watching

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
Popular science speech

95
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Mastering Popular Science Speech

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
I only spoke once and I was not invited again

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,900
but

98
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,400
Hongyang spoke five times

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,800
So what we're talking about today

100
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,340
but a good speaker

101
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,740
then let's applaud

102
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,240
welcome to our speakers today

103
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,940
Thanks

104
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,240
Thank you for your introduction

105
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,140
I wasn't that nervous just now

106
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,520
see my advisor

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,940
Miss Xiaoyu, let me test

108
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,580
i'm getting nervous

109
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
Because he is coming to check

110
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,880
Wait a moment

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,680
over he said

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,920
I never recognized this student

113
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
then i will be miserable

114
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,320
Because I'm here

115
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,360
good

116
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,820
Thanks

117
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,160
Hongyang told me that my senior invited me to come

118
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,360
I often tell him

119
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,020
where i work

120
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
In fact, our director

121
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,260
Director Xu is also here

122
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,560
We are working in the place of water life

123
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,760
Actually there is a reason

124
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
Because at Lintai Research Station

125
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,760
About two kilometers to the northeast

126
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
then go out

127
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,260
more than 1,000 meters deep sea

128
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,840
the water is deep

129
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,140
four kilometers to the west

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
But in the midst of the hot spring water and the heat of life

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,440
we live there every day

132
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,440
It seems that the cold snap has started these days

133
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,640
we are not afraid at all

134
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Eighty yuan to take a bath and go home and turn on the air conditioner to sleep and take a bath

135
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,320
I share with you

136
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,080
Because opportunity came to our research station

137
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
We will definitely treat you to seafood

138
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,580
good

139
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,280
Well, there's an interesting interlude to this speech.

140
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,080
It was September 13 last year

141
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,080
I received a call from Mr. Zhang Guoke and Mr. Hong

142
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,760
He said we sent you an invitation two weeks ago

143
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,760
You don't know what decisions I make

144
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
please give a speech

145
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
I said that one point

146
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I just came back from Japan Rokujima University for two months

147
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
a lot of junk mail

148
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,760
When I saw Zhang Guozhu, I dropped him

149
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Because we have too many letters

150
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,440
so now give me a raise

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
he said ah ah ah

152
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Vice President Chen Jianmin don't invite you

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
I said yes, definitely come, definitely come

154
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,760
But I also need information from there

155
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,360
Today is November, right?

156
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,700
In other words, Dean Chen has already listed out the menu for next year.

157
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,460
So their team is actually full of hard work

158
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,960
Let's give him a round of applause, shall we?

159
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Thanks

160
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
Thanks

161
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,900
In fact, he is actually what we talk about in Taiwan.

162
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,000
Going to break through the sieve

163
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,600
This dish has been exhausted

164
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,600
We're just chefs to dress up the master...to cook the dishes

165
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
So today I will talk to you

166
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,100
Tell me about the research I've done over the past 20 years

167
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,100
So let me share with you that these numbers are first-hand

168
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Well this is me in America

169
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,600
The team that came back to Taiwan later

170
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,100
Chen Yuanhe lived there

171
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,600
Canadian Postar Japanese Postar

172
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Italy, Japan, Britain, Postar

173
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
and German graduate students

174
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,100
So our team looks like this

175
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,600
The information I will share with you today

176
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,100
mostly these people

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
produced

178
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,040
my responsibility is just to take it

179
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,500
digest

180
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,740
present is for everyone

181
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,900
Actually the happiest thing

182
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,340
it should be them not me

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,700
i often say

184
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
I want the old teacher Liao

185
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,140
I told Teacher Liao

186
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,940
when someone was a student

187
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,140
It's the teacher's previous life's debt to persuade you

188
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,340
So I'll be a teacher for the rest of my life to pay off your debt

189
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,340
give you money

190
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,940
let you say happy

191
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,640
In the end, the teacher only asked for money for writing the plan over there.

192
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,540
So I've turned back to asking people

193
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm paying off debts

194
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
The latest batch is my creditors

195
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,780
I write plans to raise them

196
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,080
then this is

197
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,780
wait a minute we're talking

198
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,280
The Vision of Sakura Duowendui

199
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Speaking of Dual Group Vision

200
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,780
It's all done by these two ladies

201
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
then this is the new colleague

202
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
only recently

203
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
Just started joining a year ago

204
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
So

205
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
Today we are going to talk about dark colors

206
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,280
many people have said

207
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,780
Wow, it's like going to a nightclub

208
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,780
because i believe

209
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Then move the behavior

210
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
It turns out that there is an act of faith

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,900
I just wanted to listen to it. I wanted to listen to the sex act. I was a little disappointed.

212
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,300
I only talk about sex, like it’s called gender in English, not sex

213
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,900
Behavior is behavior not sexual behavior

214
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,460
It's gender and behavior that were two different things ago

215
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,860
But before that, let's get to know a fish, a species of fish

216
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,300
There are many kinds of fish that can be negotiated. Everyone knows that this supermarket can buy submarine machines.

217
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,060
In fact, it can't live on the seabed if it depends on air

218
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,340
But because the meat is delicious, there is a sea machine, it is mainly this fish

219
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,780
What's the name of this fish? Mackerel. The conversation is called enahi.

220
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,340
Modification bonito katsuobushi everyone eats

221
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,340
To cut into pieces means to cut up the fish and dry it in the sun

222
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,940
Then after the flower effect, it can be seen that it is katsuobushi

223
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,340
Or talk called enahi or hui en

224
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,340
Let's see how this fish gets to your table

225
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,940
There is a video to watch

226
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,340
4 types of fish in weather

227
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But this boat is not setting nets.

228
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The ancient technique of fishing with rod and line is now practiced on an industrial scale.

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The water jets break up the outline of the boat from below,

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and mimic the noise and motion of the boat.

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The water jets break up the outline of the boat from below,

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and mimic the noise and motion of the boat.

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Meanwhile, line faces are swarming around the boat to keep the tuna alive.

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It may look like a fish, but it's not.

235
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The water jets break up the outline of the boat from below,

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and mimic the noise and motion of the boat when under attack.

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,120
like a lot of effort for a few fish, but this pole and line technique of fishing

238
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
could be surprisingly effective.

239
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,600
Fishing for heckles is now big business in the tropical Pacific, with tuna alone

240
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,600
accounting for 30 times more fish than all the fish caught by subsistence fishermen.

241
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:32,600
So is commercial fishing sustainable?

242
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Skidjack are the smallest and by far the most abundant tuna species in the Pacific.

243
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,600
They reach maturity in just a year and then spawn many times within a season.

244
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,600
They seem to be the perfect catch, as their numbers just keep...

245
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:02,440
This is also my personal favourite of all the sana earlier.

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
i went fishing once

247
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,160
Fished for four hours

248
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
I was actually crying a little bit that night

249
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
Because the channel can no longer speak

250
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,860
Still want to beat the chicken slack

251
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,000
take painkillers

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,060
I can't even sleep

253
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,600
It fell out of nowhere

254
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
So you want to know what fishing is

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just participate in this Poen Line once

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,500
You said you don't have to pull the hook

257
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,800
ok why put this video for everyone to see

258
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,700
It is that we are very smart

259
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,600
A system of two senses to catch this fish

260
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,500
One is to hear it and the water is bumping in the water

261
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,200
produce this sound

262
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,800
Then you throw the fire goose down again

263
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,500
That fire goose is probably milkfish from Taiwan

264
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
They sent them to buy and make fire geese

265
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
fire goose to trick it

266
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,700
then remove it with clip ear

267
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,900
so just tell what

268
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,200
There must be two most important sensory systems

269
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,400
Hearing and vision use these two to deceive it

270
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Okay, so first we'll talk about

271
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,200
hearing

272
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,100
that sense of hearing

273
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,100
what is the opposite of

274
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,760
may you make a sound

275
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,600
you will make a sound

276
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,080
your ears are for sound

277
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,440
let's see this is me

278
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,360
In the United States, a graduate student named Dangjiang Province

279
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,960
part of his doctoral thesis

280
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,080
you'll see later

281
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,280
This black one is an underwater microphone

282
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,840
Then it's rain of work

283
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,920
This is the tide he cooked

284
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,080
Let's see what happens

285
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,080
good

286
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,280
This is the mother, come in and check

287
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,920
Take a look and check the tide he cooks

288
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,680
Let's see if this is a land-protected mansion

289
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,440
the price

290
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,200
Well, during our work period, we have discovered

291
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,760
The quality of this tide

292
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,600
and the quality of the citizen's voice

293
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,280
is a female fish decides

294
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,600
One reason to mate with him

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,880
This is a

296
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,600
this is your sunfish

297
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,400
he because

298
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,640
he because he has a

299
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,480
This often has sunfish

300
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,960
he because

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
it has a protrusion on the back of the plug

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It looks like everyone's ears, so it's called Long ear sandwich

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is the typical behavior of this Chill

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well it's mainly it's important to use the sound

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Because there is no one in the world to talk about the graduation certificate of National Taiwan University

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There is no Porsche double P car

307
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So the sound becomes a whole display of all its qualities

308
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
so this is a way

309
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And then my British Porsche Tinture experiment

310
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This experiment is to use this fish to go

311
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Native to Indochina Peninsula

312
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's roughly the size of a maze box

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It has nothing to defend itself against instinct

314
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's the only way the most important thing is

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It found a gap in the pile of stones and hid

316
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
if there is something covering its head

317
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
it will feel safe

318
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So we teach its animals this behavior

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Just put a piece of black duck on it so it can fall off like this

320
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Dig your own house for it to live in

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,140
It doesn't care at all, as long as there is a stain on its head, it is very happy

322
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,700
So I put this fish in for another one.

323
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,060
After about five days to a week, another one will go in

324
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,880
and see what happens

325
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,140
They can go on like this for hours

326
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,740
Then the winner lives in the bunker mansion.

327
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,580
Then that Su family became a corner that no one could visit.

328
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,940
It turned out that when we did this experiment, the body length and weight were exactly the same size

329
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,220
but we found

330
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,340
The new home of the Su family depends on the quality of his luck, I will make another summer later

331
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,620
this is another

332
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,160
the second

333
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,240
It's summer in America

334
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,500
southeast coast

335
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,540
gulf of mexico

336
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,360
And the northeast coast of Brazil, the southwest coast

337
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,640
Guangchen fish

338
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,180
Then it's because we're called Oyster

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,400
Because he likes to find this mother honey glue to dig a hole for water

340
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,200
go in

341
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,600
just take a picture from above

342
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,400
But I follow their own two generations of laboratory fish like this

343
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,600
still looks like this

344
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,800
Actually I quite like him

345
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
because of that

346
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
yesterday was ugly

347
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
because he looks like me

348
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
really ugly

349
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
but he is ugly

350
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,800
This merit is during the reproductive season

351
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
He will have the following voice

352
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,800
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

353
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
For mother honey

354
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
This is the sexiest voice in the world

355
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
he just wants to hear this

356
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,200
He couldn't understand Chen Zhihong's speech

357
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,400
All he heard was woo woo woo woo woo

358
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,600
and can call

359
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
Called from 8 am to night

360
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Keep calling after 1 or 2 o'clock

361
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
I just listened to do this experiment

362
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,200
sleep on the boat

363
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Couldn't sleep at all that night

364
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,800
all night not all the time howling

365
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Ohh Ohh ohh

366
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,400
It took me half a day to do this

367
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
So we did an experiment

368
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
what is this experiment

369
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,400
Carabelle with me, the mother of the Republic of China

370
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,200
called Major

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
In fact, they are very similar

372
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Our mouth is as big as this shit

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
it has four fish making sounds

374
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
so we dive right in front of it

375
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
There's a microphone that says if you want to sing, record it

376
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There are F1, F2, F3, F4

377
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Then go back to the laboratory and put this C on the computer for analysis

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This is F1

379
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
just find it very low frequency

380
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but it's high pressure

381
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
F2 and F3 are high frequency, lower intermediate frequency voltage

382
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Although F4 is an intermediate frequency, it is relatively low frequency compared to these two

383
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
but it's low

384
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
what do we find in this behavior

385
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
When this F4 is called

386
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
F1, F2, F3 will call

387
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
When F3 is calling, F1 and F2 will call

388
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
F2 calls, F1 will call

389
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
When F1 is called, WF2, F3, F2, F3, F4 are probably not called

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,440
I found out he has a way of sounding signs

391
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Like they know the social hierarchy between

392
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,880
This is our conversation

393
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,320
instead we talk now

394
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,480
big brother in the underworld

395
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,720
Big brother speaks little brother

396
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,440
that's all

397
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,200
that's what you think about

398
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,360
Is there such a situation in our human society?

399
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,600
see if there is

400
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,520
listen again

401
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,600
that sound

402
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,520
In this young students

403
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,720
you just want to chase your girlfriend

404
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,800
don't make that sound

405
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
He must have struck you out

406
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,800
just for you is toe free

407
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,800
Then I'll tell him about our

408
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
in our human society

409
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,160
Is there such a sequence

410
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,960
let's see

411
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,040
I just finished eating

412
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
take a peek at my senior

413
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,120
his hair is not very white

414
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,720
also

415
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,560
That means the dean is treating him well.

416
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,920
before i come today

417
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,720
I special committee

418
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,240
make sure

419
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,200
hair washes clean

420
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,320
Otherwise it's so white

421
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,120
In fact, I am more pitiful than him

422
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
I have a director above me

423
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,000
live there

424
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,840
In addition to my director, I also have a director

425
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,680
So I have more shit on my head than others

426
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,080
So don't underestimate, fish can tell many stories

427
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,840
So from the fish, you can know how the society in the world is doing

428
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,420
ok , another one is italian

429
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,880
Experiments by Niklas

430
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,840
The experiment I did is called a long article and a short sentence.

431
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,600
It doesn't grow very big, it's about this big

432
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,640
It is also a system belonging to the Meigong River Basin

433
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,240
You can go to the aquarium in the fifth section of Minquan East Road to buy it.

434
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,560
You must buy two bows

435
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,720
it put it in a small aquarium

436
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,080
There is a plastic partition in the middle to separate it

437
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,520
And then a week later you pull the divider apart

438
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,640
you know what's going to happen

439
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,120
just one or two bows

440
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,400
why did someone come to my house

441
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,040
So its first action is to turn the plug outward

442
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,080
turn it inside out on both sides

443
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,840
The three-pronged rope called trigeminal

444
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,520
just make its face bigger

445
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,000
Although it passes the university every year

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,320
But you know that the face should be bigger and the body should be proportional

447
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,680
so it makes the face bigger

448
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
he can do it

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
he thinks he must

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
For example, don't let people see your side

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He miscarried on the side

452
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
then i have half an hour

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No one has to throw in the towel before they make the next move

454
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
just start singing like this

455
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Can sing for about half an hour to an hour

456
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
there must be a winner

457
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Winners come from a saying that they are very at ease

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The calligrapher is hiding in the corner

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Then I just heard that it's called Double Click

460
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Road, road, road, road

461
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
we know why

462
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
you record it

463
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Then put each tone of this

464
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If you pull it out

465
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It becomes Drum, drum, drum, drum

466
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's because he has two ligaments

467
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
like he's playing guitar

468
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The ligament and the 7 strips model him

469
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Just Drum, drum

470
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We cut that ligament off with small scissors

471
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
become Drum

472
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
cut two off

473
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
become trumpet

474
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
no sound

475
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But it doesn't matter he two weeks later

476
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I will grow back and take it back

477
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
ok so now this is fish number one and it looks like this and fish number two looks like this

478
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Then we invite this teacher Xu, this is the physics teacher to tell me

479
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Which one will be the winner, number one or number two?

480
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
number two

481
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
number two, pay attention, it is a physics teacher

482
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Ok, then you start with physical nouns, you must use physical nouns

483
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Why do you think it's a winner?

484
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What do you say about continuous nouns in physics?

485
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
duration time

486
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You see, I'm putting on his spot now, there's a video here

487
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
your principal will see

488
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
In fact, you will really see it, and then, what is the second parameter?

489
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
One duration, yes, and the second one is amplitude, how do you say it in Chinese?

490
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Then, what is the third one?

491
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Dear students, have you watched the live broadcast?

492
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Maybe ask the teacher to make a fuss about Dr. Chen

493
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
At once

494
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Frequency

495
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It is Repetition Rate

496
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
yes

497
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
just these three

498
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
as many stories as we just told

499
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's important for the voice to become a

500
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
a Param

501
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
A Currence

502
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
a cash

503
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
where did it come from

504
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
equal to say

505
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Equivalent to our human BnW or Porsche

506
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Because its fish world doesn't have these things

507
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
just use this voice as a

508
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
a female fish for this

509
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
folding standard

510
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
or when fighting

511
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Do you want to throw in the towel

512
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It is done by these three Parameters

513
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
so

514
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
sometimes

515
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Winner

516
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What are the three characteristics of your family?

517
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
one is

518
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
that voice you just said

519
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
big at noon

520
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and then the second one

521
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Your Repetition Rate

522
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
just repeat the sound

523
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
hair a lot

524
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and the third one

525
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It is Duration

526
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
your time is very long

527
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
then this

528
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Whether you are two boys fighting

529
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Or mother and child are choosing a son

530
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Actually it is Parameter

531
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,600
It is these three perimeters that work

532
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,000
In fact, we have several academicians here

533
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Why do they become academicians

534
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,300
must make sense

535
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,600
I

536
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,400
right

537
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,000
What's this

538
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,740
the government is

539
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,600
papers are published in

540
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,700
nature or science

541
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,400
The impact factor is very large

542
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Then what

543
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,100
one day

544
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,300
have been publishing paper

545
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,000
Then once it is published, it will not stop for 30 to 40 years.

546
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
because I have never encountered this

547
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,700
this does not meet the condition

548
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,900
so i this

549
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,200
A lot of researcher with a lot of shit on his head

550
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,200
The difference between the academicians present here lies in this place

551
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
I have always regarded it as my norm

552
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,400
But if you can't do it, you can't do it, there's no way

553
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,100
Just open your mouth and talk

554
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,400
good

555
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
So now speaking the voice will make the voice

556
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,700
The other torus must be something

557
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,400
can you hear the sound

558
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,000
what is that

559
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
his fish ears

560
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,900
Everyone wonders why fish have ears

561
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
I was very impressed at this time

562
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
One year I came back from America

563
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,500
my dad said

564
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,800
son what are you doing in america

565
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
that studies the ear

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
listen to the festival i tell you

567
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It turned out that that night my festival told me something

568
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Ba said those jokes

569
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I said why

570
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Ba said he's seen fish ears from there all his life

571
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
how can fish hear

572
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
He said he was right, and my dad had a point.

573
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Because I don't have the responsibility to be good at science popularization

574
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So then I'll play a trick

575
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
to make everyone understand

576
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What is popular science? Fish definitely have ears

577
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's just that he only has an inner ear, he doesn't have a middle ear or an outer ear.

578
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
so i want to call a name

579
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
If you know someone, you can't find my illicit mother.

580
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
it's you

581
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Hui Ting

582
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
you tell everyone

583
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Why do fish have no outer and middle ears?

584
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Look at me, I'm still listening to my speech

585
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
have been marked by me

586
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I won't dare anymore

587
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
After that, no one came to listen to my speech.

588
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Only my first teacher, Hui Ting, is left

589
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
do you know

590
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
master can't teach

591
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,840
No

592
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,400
okay it's okay

593
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
think about it

594
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
feet hey no extra

595
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,040
Then you have seen whales and dolphins have extra

596
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,800
it's a common weapon

597
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,080
it is turned around one day

598
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,800
But there is no one in the sea

599
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,040
I'm sure I can't afford it

600
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,080
I go to that place no one goes I go down

601
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,040
bro don't forget

602
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,880
The blueprint it carries is

603
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,520
Absolutely with the amount

604
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
think about why

605
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
Okay, then it's right to have a credit

606
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
but you put your ears

607
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,360
This two years are almost in the eyes

608
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,760
if you open it up

609
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,560
It sees that there are three regulation

610
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,600
Then the sound Circular Canel

611
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,440
and three listeners

612
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,520
One is called Circular

613
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,240
One is called Utical

614
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,560
One is called LaGina

615
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
then we are human

616
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,360
We don't have this LaGina thing

617
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,720
We specialize into ear melon tubes

618
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,160
Your auditory cells are located in this place

619
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,600
that fish is relatively

620
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,320
I won't say more primitive

621
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
it's simpler

622
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,960
So inside it is

623
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,800
There are these auditory cells hair cells

624
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,140
compare this hair cell to a human hair cell

625
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,560
Actually they are all the same

626
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,240
So don't forget that there's a fish living inside you

627
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,440
Your ears are the fish for you

628
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,080
So what are the sounds that fish can hear?

629
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,120
Because the underwater factor is 1500 meters

630
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,560
every second

631
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,240
So its Water Length Wenku is very wide

632
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,920
So for the fish character we say 1500 meters

633
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,760
If the character's 500Hz voice

634
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,720
Its wave tiger is 3 meters

635
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,640
Which fish has a cross-section larger than 3 meters

636
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
that amazing fish

637
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,240
Probably the only way to kill

638
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,240
So your boho is less than 3 meters

639
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,400
The sound passes through your body

640
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,680
Your body is transparent to sound

641
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,320
So when the sound is passing through your ears

642
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,800
you have an otolith

643
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,080
The otolith is very dense and does not move

644
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
The following hair cells are light

645
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
it will be moved by the sound

646
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,120
it doesn't move it moves

647
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,600
In this way it moves a little bit

648
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,280
action potential

649
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
from the time I opened my mouth until now

650
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,160
Can you hear it is this hair cell

651
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
Once again, the ear really vibrates

652
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
produce the effect like this

653
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,660
good

654
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
that was 15 years ago

655
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,660
I was doing this fish hearing

656
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,160
At that time, the traditional method was used

657
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,160
Punch a hole in a fish's ear

658
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Sound the electrodes into the brain

659
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,800
to play the sound

660
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Then watch it electroacoustic your change

661
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,300
found that there is a shortcoming

662
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
That is to say, the classical method

663
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,300
It takes about

664
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
it will take a year

665
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Then sacrifice at least 50 to 60 fish

666
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,300
will produce a so-called

667
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
hearing sensitivity curve

668
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Then I like to be lazy

669
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Is there a way I don't have to do this kind of thing

670
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
quick way

671
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
I thought of a name called

672
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Methods for Measuring the Responses of the Auditory Brainstem

673
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,300
In fact, I borrowed this method from

674
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
people to use

675
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
If you go to ENT

676
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
This is what is used in hearing tests

677
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Auditory Bronstem Respawn

678
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
AVR method to measure it

679
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
exist

680
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Christmas

681
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,100
Because it can be used medically and clinically

682
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,160
Radicals can be bought and used as long as they have tens of thousands of dollars

683
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,700
But no one is doing that

684
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,240
So I want to say that we can't develop this system

685
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
So it took me a while to post a few postals with me

686
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,440
we'll get it out

687
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,360
But this is the first set in the world

688
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,460
That is to say, in addition to humans, it is possible to measure auditory brainstem brainwaves

689
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,560
It will also give me some ground in this science

690
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,500
So let's use this method to ask a question

691
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,440
asked many questions

692
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
There is a very interesting question here, that is,

693
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,120
So what are the special functions of some specialized auditory organs of this fish?

694
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Well you see this because it is

695
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
It's just the arrangement in our lab.

696
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,280
This is not done by commercial itself

697
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,160
flooded the water

698
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,800
then the fish anesthetizes it

699
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
Then replace the two electrodes

700
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,240
Then give it the sound and it generates brainwaves

701
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,000
Just use these electrodes to pick up the brain waves and send them to the computer.

702
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,360
this is a goldfish

703
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,520
when you give it 600Hz sound

704
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,800
85dB produces such brain waves

705
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,400
If you reduce it like this, you can see that the government is getting smaller and smaller.

706
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,200
it's only natural

707
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,900
Because you have fewer cells participating in analytical energy

708
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,400
Because the sound is not so bright

709
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,200
When there is no way to repeat this place

710
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,300
we just know

711
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,900
This has reached the preset value and is called stretch hold

712
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,200
So it means that it can be heard above 65dB

713
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,900
Can't hear even under 65dB

714
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,100
Then the whole system is controlled by computer

715
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,800
So it saves time

716
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
allows me to do many things at the same time

717
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,100
OK, now that I have this system, I will ask a question

718
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,500
It was a bloodbath in 1931

719
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,800
This German scientist is called Carbon Fuchs

720
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,600
he published a paper

721
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,500
A report on Yure's hearing during his life

722
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,400
was in 1931 nature

723
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,300
then at that time

724
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,900
If you want to publish nature, it is now a make-up

725
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,200
it was easy

726
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,800
He just said my bad knife in the armor of this chance

727
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,300
pull out this sign

728
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,000
then sew it back on

729
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,800
After a week I found out that this language is hard of hearing

730
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,200
At that time, he proved a hypothesis that he thought the mark was in this place

731
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,640
He has three small shares called Wei's small shares

732
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,720
Because the pressure wave is generated after the sound passes through

733
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,800
The pressure wave will be transmitted to Neiwei through these three small units

734
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,040
So I said he said that if I remove this mark

735
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,680
he hears you lose

736
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,960
These three small stocks are like our life

737
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,600
Isn't there a needle for playing that vinyl record?

738
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,320
He is similar to acupunctuations inserted in front of this sign

739
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,040
So you can send the sound pressure forward

740
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,760
So he said I just do a simple thing

741
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,880
Everyone, everyone, Feng Xia, after the week

742
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
I use piano oil words to change the voice for him

743
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,760
he doesn't come so he proves

744
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,840
He said this on NATURE

745
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,120
After I have this method, I want to say

746
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,040
I'm here to challenge him, right?

747
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,960
actually a bit

748
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,680
not too fine

749
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,200
Because he was the winner of the Nobel Prize in 1973

750
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
nobel prize winner i went to challenge

751
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,000
You all know my personality likes to challenge authority

752
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,200
Often challenge Mr. Liao

753
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,440
Breath, other things are good to create

754
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,600
Okay, then I'll be the first to say, this normal fish, you were soaring just now

755
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,200
I measure his brain waves and his hearing curve

756
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,260
Then come again, take that syringe

757
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,600
The needle goes down and the breath is sucked out

758
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,900
Then compare and see the difference in his hearing ability

759
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,940
You see, there are

760
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,080
When there is gas, you can see the brain waves. If this is One MicroBoat, at least three MicroBoats

761
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,920
You can pump out the air, it produces brain waves, and the corresponding waves are still in the

762
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,980
But his overall Amplitude has decreased, for example, he does

763
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:38,140
Carp on Fish is right about his speech, he does play an aural facilitative role

764
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:44,020
Then my Fenghua told me that this is a sensitive curve, which is what normal fish look like

765
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:49,140
But if you inhale the breath, his whole Shut Hold will be lifted up

766
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,220
Proof that Carp on Fish is right

767
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,520
then i this

768
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,080
One advantage of my so-called ABR method is that it restores badness

769
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
As long as the brains of the twins are healthy

770
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
because you think you go to the hospital

771
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Then you punch me another hole

772
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Then there's the fright

773
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
How bad is it with people in the end

774
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
already broke for you

775
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
impossible

776
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
right

777
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So the benefit is

778
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
so I

779
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
This is the black line is the original statement

780
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Base line的data

781
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And then this is after the gas, you see

782
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
this

783
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This sortial increase

784
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Then I put the fish back

785
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Put that fish back like a submarine

786
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
sinking

787
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
because it has no label

788
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It exists below and does not move

789
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
like this

790
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
then you pay attention

791
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
it's a day or two

792
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Will wake up on the third day

793
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
fourth day

794
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
No problem until the fifth day

795
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
can have again

796
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
sorry

797
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I'm going to take it out and weigh it again

798
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Look at this black and white

799
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
White is the same as black

800
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So it does

801
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Cowabon Fish is right

802
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Its Nobel Prize is not in vain

803
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But it's not because

804
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
for the nobel prize

805
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
it is because doing the seal

806
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Can dance to win the Nobel Prize

807
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
everybody knows

808
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
it was then

809
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's poor when it's done for hearing

810
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's kind of like my dad's influence

811
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,740
His beyond fate is the same as my father said

812
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,440
At that time in 1930, the German bosses

813
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,440
Just say you have seen how his ears can hear

814
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,240
So every shoe he got was wiped out

815
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,040
There is Colin's standby

816
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,880
And then while Payport went out talking nonsense

817
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,040
so will reject

818
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,200
And Fosha had no choice but to seal it.

819
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,240
So everyone now knows that seals can dance

820
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,440
I have a kind of gratitude to the big guys in Germany at that time

821
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,000
Because he published Payport

822
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
I didn't change it today

823
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,240
It's that simple

824
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,280
Now a few years ago there was a very HOT show started

825
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,280
According to the IPCC, the global warming of CO2

826
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Large emissions of CO2 are not good

827
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,840
Well, a laboratory of the Australian Academy of Sciences

828
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,480
Global I used to come in 2009 and 2009

829
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,280
It's not me anymore

830
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,440
It was Chen Zhaolun who asked him to give a speech

831
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm going to find someone to invite him

832
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,040
He came to the middle to give a talk

833
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,280
Talk about ocean acidification

834
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,040
But he has an article in Science in 2070

835
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,240
There is a very beautiful Payport

836
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,200
That is to say, after atmospheric CO2 enters the water,

837
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,160
The ocean will combine with the H2O in the water

838
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,400
becomes mesocarbonate and releases a wave of hydrogen ions

839
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,160
Hydrogen ions remove carbonic acid in water

840
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Calcium carbonate ions grab it and turn it into medium carbonic acid

841
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,440
The most important thing to form coral is to have

842
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,060
Calcium carbonate must have carbonic acid plus this

843
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,160
Calcium plus carbonic acid to maintain balance

844
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,720
Well the next one is good because the phenomenon happens

845
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,600
If the CO2 in your atmosphere keeps increasing

846
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,200
The amount of carbonate in your water is getting less and less

847
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,160
It will become less and less, so it is a serious problem

848
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,480
So now everyone is predicting Da Baojiao

849
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,960
Likely to be gone in 50 years

850
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,120
Because it means you didn't build a house and you didn't have cement

851
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,200
how do you build a house

852
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,800
He's here to report that you're expected to say

853
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,240
After the foot temperature rose by two degrees

854
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,560
This is the phenomenon that today's business glue will become a B

855
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,800
Look at the calcium carbonate ions in the COPMATE water

856
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,560
It will be less and less, so the CO2 will be less and less

857
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,400
This side increases and this side becomes less and less

858
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,400
Then corner B continues

859
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
If there is this COTO release

860
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,200
Will become this Wheel is not Coro's

861
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,400
That's stone glue

862
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,400
What are the benefits of three glue

863
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,000
because it has a high

864
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It means that you build a house very cheaply

865
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,400
Many animals give life to people

866
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
As long as the stone glue is smooth and smooth

867
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
So it has a picture that is

868
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
if today is like this

869
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,300
If it is B, if it rises two degrees

870
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,600
COTO continues to increase to 400 to 450

871
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,200
When the third historical year exceeds 500ppm

872
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
temperature rose by three degrees

873
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
This is like saying that it has become a piece of history.

874
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
This is what he does not necessarily

875
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,800
But it's officially happening

876
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,600
Taiwan also has recently

877
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,500
They also discovered it off the coast of Kochi

878
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,400
They have three glues and are slowly disappearing.

879
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,500
Well, I just mentioned that

880
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,100
Fish can hear sounds because

881
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,800
Produced by the interaction of ear food and hair cells

882
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,500
then we ask a question

883
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,600
So if it's ocean acidification, isn't it?

884
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,000
This is calcium carbonate and banana

885
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Have the sense of hearing affected by Yang Shigui

886
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,120
So I followed a researcher in the United States

887
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Steve Simpson and another Wittlich

888
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,000
Then talk to the European and Australian team

889
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Let's do a transnational research

890
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,320
What is transnational research

891
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,280
We call this anemone clownfish

892
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,800
Because our hearing of him has been from his birth

893
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,000
when i was teaching in america

894
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,200
We did a series of experiments

895
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,760
Let's melt this fish out

896
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,160
this rich

897
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,680
You see, this is almost 13 minimit 1.3 cm

898
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,680
We keep this wealth in

899
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,680
The concentration of the four ph

900
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,480
This is the current pH of seawater at 8.15

901
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,680
This is estimated by the IPCC International Climate Organization

902
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,040
After 210 years or 87 years

903
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,080
If it is the first discharge, it will become 7.99

904
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,880
Medium emissions 7.93

905
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,640
High emission is 7.86

906
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,360
we're imitating him

907
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,880
Tried raising for 20 days

908
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,080
and see if you can win

909
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,760
its auditory related behavior

910
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,860
That's how we test

911
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,000
The benefits of doing behavior promotion

912
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Devices that don’t have to be too fancy

913
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
There is no need to rush and mix millions

914
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,100
It looks like the vice president is playing instruments worth tens of millions

915
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,000
We will send fish one by one

916
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
The Sashimi box that comes is ready for experiments

917
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
This is the Styrofoam box

918
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,000
Just a few hundred dollars

919
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
We look down from above

920
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
we put the fish in here

921
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,200
There's an underwater distress machine on each side here.

922
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,800
play sound

923
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,000
so make it random

924
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,800
can put it down

925
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
the sound is coming from here

926
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
or the sound of putting it down is coming from this side

927
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,500
Let's listen here

928
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,800
What are we diving into the sound of this business glue

929
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,000
Then this business gel these fish are very interesting

930
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,800
It does not quite drive into the business glue during the day

931
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Because it will be eaten alive

932
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,700
it goes in at night

933
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,400
Let's see what sound it hears

934
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,340
so the voice of business teaches

935
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,040
There is this kind of sound during the day, but it may not be so much at night

936
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,140
It is very noisy during the day

937
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,300
OK, let's play this sound for him.

938
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,100
Then see how much time is more than 50%

939
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,840
Do you know what it means if it exceeds 50%

940
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,540
Says he's hearing impaired so he'll get over that

941
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,460
Otherwise he shouldn't because that means

942
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,940
This is the voice made by the business teacher. He should leave him.

943
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,180
As a result, no matter which low concentration, medium concentration or high concentration emission

944
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,760
behavioral responses that affect his hearing

945
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,920
Said he did have hearing damage

946
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,220
Of course, we have some time to do some follow-up

947
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,360
But we'll be publishing this report soon.

948
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,360
In this Biocommunication of the Royal Society

949
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,580
This is my graduate student in the United States He is the United States

950
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,820
He's a graduate student, he's an undergraduate student.

951
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,020
we'll just post this

952
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,180
what to do

953
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,020
The world's first proof that

954
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,220
Acidification does affect hearing

955
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,920
However, because of this, there are papers published

956
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
so we got one last year

957
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Get a National Science Council Plan Today

958
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,760
Continue to explain

959
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,400
Shuanghua to Taiwan's

960
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
What is the impact of Shiban industry's breeding?

961
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,960
So

962
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,240
I can report to you

963
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,360
we've done it twice

964
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,640
Tried three times

965
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,080
we live here

966
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,160
The double one is 7.8

967
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,640
Do you know how much worse it is compared to 8.6

968
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
That growth difference is 30%

969
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,160
so it's pretty obvious

970
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,680
very very obvious

971
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Of course we are still continuing in the classic

972
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,280
there are many things to discuss

973
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Then you ask me

974
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,600
Is this Taiwan or Japan?

975
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,040
The United States probably doesn't ask this question much.

976
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
before you and i order

977
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,240
Then feed you scientists

978
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,200
then you to Taiwan

979
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,440
What is your contribution to this industry

980
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,840
so this me and my japanese

981
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,560
Kyushu

982
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,520
The safety joint experience of that Kyushu Island University

983
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,840
He will also have American PoSAR in Japan

984
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,520
we are at

985
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,360
Do an experiment in Routing Island Harbor

986
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Traditionally Japanese

987
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,440
Mutual breeding is very developed

988
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,800
usually now

989
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
in a laboratory or in a greenhouse

990
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,080
raised to a certain extent

991
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,720
Then put it in the sun

992
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,120
Drive up the fishing cart and meet the seashore

993
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,600
and then put it on the boat and then tow it out

994
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,160
What's the downside of that?

995
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,400
Because you caught the fish and put it under stress

996
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,240
Get up when the stress slips

997
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,720
Then the immunity is lowered

998
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,800
and when you are in the middle of the night

999
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,760
You're damaged and susceptible to infection

1000
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,440
So generally make a change in the middle of the night to lose

1001
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,440
All about 10% to 15% or even as high as 28%

1002
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,640
may even be wiped out

1003
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,920
so what do we have

1004
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
to make a thought is to say

1005
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,720
this is spicy

1006
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,280
We'll just buy 50,000 of these small fish

1007
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,920
put this

1008
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,360
Inside a township net in Luluo Island Harbor

1009
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,160
when we feed it every day

1010
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,760
play the sound to it

1011
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,320
Put 600Hz so much

1012
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,920
just like that

1013
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,880
Russia's Parallel Free Response

1014
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,720
so everyone turn upside down

1015
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,360
you just play your voice

1016
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,280
it knows it's going to be fed

1017
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,640
So we have to raise it to such a big time

1018
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,440
let's say yes

1019
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,320
then we go from here

1020
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,800
Take it to another village net to raise

1021
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,600
go put it in

1022
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,680
about 4.3 kilometers

1023
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,120
then let's see if something happens

1024
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
a bit sour

1025
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,400
now this life saver

1026
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,900
He used the gastroenterology machine to turn off the wind and use a flashlight to avoid the sound

1027
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
then left

1028
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,400
see what happens

1029
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
it most has this buoy

1030
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Floating there, we just what buoy

1031
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
it's going to make it an action

1032
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
wait why both

1033
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
a same word, a same word

1034
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Now let's look at this angle

1035
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
so keep going

1036
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
called you do

1037
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
don't let my students know

1038
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
The most floating is located in

1039
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Look, one step is gone

1040
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
This pass, you see, it's gone

1041
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
good

1042
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's for being a teacher

1043
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I hope your graduate students look like this

1044
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,900
Just change the horn and he will follow you like this

1045
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,900
I will go with you without hesitation

1046
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,900
But there are two trips mentioned just now.

1047
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,400
We just had someone tell you to look at that buoy

1048
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,300
what's over there

1049
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,400
Because this experiment was done with 50,000 fry

1050
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,300
The Japanese are actually similar to the Taiwanese

1051
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,300
You did your experiment and the fish ran away

1052
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,100
you are responsible

1053
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,900
Are you stealing fish to sell you know

1054
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,600
Director Xu knows this

1055
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,100
he was also investigated

1056
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,600
Did you steal the fish and sell it?

1057
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,400
So we have to be afraid that the fish will not be stolen

1058
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,700
won't run away

1059
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,700
so make it up and surround it

1060
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,200
As a result, when we come back from the experiment

1061
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,000
We earn more than 1,000 fish a year alone

1062
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Because the network is like this

1063
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Than his child will be in the circle

1064
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Hurry up to that rally

1065
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,500
As a result, I earned more than a thousand

1066
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
nothing to say

1067
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,900
Make more than 1,000 articles

1068
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
There are all kinds of fish

1069
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,500
good

1070
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,200
The second we will put the data

1071
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,500
we found fish

1072
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,600
that ass man has such a small brain

1073
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,900
You wear that 500-meter, you don't feed him, you don't bird you, bye, let's go

1074
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,140
We have made a series, will publish a paper, and found that you have fed him

1075
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,780
You can wear 3.8 meters, and he will follow you

1076
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,780
So take home a message to all the teachers here

1077
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,940
That is to say, the student experience report, take him to eat the steak of that net product

1078
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,220
Yes sometimes you have to boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

1079
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:25,180
next time he heard dua, there is steak, so i just made this

1080
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,280
paper will not write to you

1081
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,620
But you have to forget, he won't be that cheap

1082
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,320
People say you have to take him to eat again in four or five months

1083
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,120
This yellow pot comes with yellow and can be added, no matter Meishan eats yellow row

1084
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,120
The online one is too expensive

1085
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,120
This is where we have contributed oil

1086
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,240
That's why you must do basic research well

1087
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,840
You can do applied research

1088
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:50,440
Taiwan has just turned it upside down, do applied research first, and ignore the basics

1089
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,840
I think Mr. Liao is the most important. Mr. Liao always encourages to do the basics

1090
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,280
He's been shouting for decades, I know

1091
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,300
It's hard work, but if not

1092
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,200
It's a waste of time, you know?

1093
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,960
Because I myself encountered an example in the United States

1094
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,960
a fishing has that deer

1095
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,600
Taiwan is called Luya, wow, it can make a sound

1096
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,320
my assistant, my researcher thinks

1097
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,880
wow, teacher, this is the best

1098
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,480
Fish catch a lot, take a bite, can't hear, fish can't hear

1099
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,240
but the best catch

1100
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,800
Let's go to the street where the water is born, the long water miscellaneous fish and deer

1101
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,880
Put the sound deer, why?

1102
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,880
it sounds best

1103
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,000
It's because the sound of the fish is the sound you hear the most

1104
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,760
But it can't be heard by fish

1105
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,400
Hear two kilohertz

1106
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,280
So we wrote, why is it good?

1107
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,480
because it fish that way

1108
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,280
Clamp it like this, all the way, to stimulate the fish's lateral line

1109
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,240
That's why the fish come to attack

1110
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,320
And it's painted red

1111
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,440
so it attacks it

1112
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,320
So let's write a popular science article

1113
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,840
Draw on Instrume

1114
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,080
As a result, a company came to Ruziana

1115
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,920
He said I'll give you thirty thousand dollars

1116
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,040
help me design a nice thing

1117
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,840
I said ok to put in my school account

1118
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,760
Because $30,000 is brought in to pay income tax

1119
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,640
Just give it to the school and let me do research

1120
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,160
just pay my income tax

1121
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,120
So that's still a set of studies that's important

1122
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,280
Applied research can only be done after economic research is completed

1123
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,680
can't be turned upside down

1124
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,240
Let's end this talk about hearing and sound

1125
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,200
The deep world is over like this

1126
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,200
Color This color is not the color of a nightclub

1127
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,480
is the color of color

1128
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,320
so let me down

1129
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,280
You see there are different heads with different eyes

1130
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,920
He can see the animals rallying with us

1131
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,640
Visible to ultraviolet light from

1132
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,560
Not purple light see red light

1133
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,680
Sorry, we humans are not very evolved and successful animals

1134
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,240
we can't see ultraviolet light

1135
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Can't see infrared light either

1136
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,520
we see ear light

1137
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,640
It is about the range of 400 to 700nm Nemi

1138
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,960
So we have a video here

1139
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,400
It's elementary school kids doing that in Hawaii

1140
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,240
Go down with a bare submarine

1141
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,040
They start at 49f which is 16 meters

1142
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,760
Then the submarine will slowly come up

1143
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:55,320
The hole next to it

1144
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,800
Students will see the outside

1145
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,120
what do we see in washington

1146
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
OK

1147
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
The space below our 50-49 feet

1148
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
let's do some experiments

1149
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Max red red red red red red red red

1150
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
because

1151
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
this gentleman

1152
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
he is there now

1153
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
us

1154
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
ok after party

1155
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
light can come in

1156
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
then what will he have now

1157
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Mystery wants to rise

1158
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
we are rising now

1159
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
OK

1160
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Watch Max Red Clothes turn red

1161
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
OK

1162
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Lighter bright on the outside

1163
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Clock starting to change the bag

1164
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
If you notice, lock the lock

1165
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Lock the lock side on the side

1166
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
38

1167
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Clock again

1168
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
All that water

1169
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Clock in the air

1170
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Watch Max shirt turn back to red

1171
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
listen to his glasses

1172
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Watch Max

1173
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Watch Max

1174
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Watch Max

1175
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Watch Max

1176
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Watch Max

1177
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Watch Max

1178
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Watch Max

1179
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Watch Max

1180
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
All right

1181
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,220
It's back.

1182
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
No no.

1183
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
good,

1184
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,720
Teacher Qu,

1185
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,760
Looking for your physics teacher again,

1186
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,560
Please tell everyone what this is about,

1187
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,760
Why is there such a phenomenon?

1188
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,400
This is at 49 feet,

1189
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,640
This is on the surface of the surface water,

1190
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,360
He wears the same clothes.

1191
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,680
Well, Gongde Shanshe,

1192
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,240
Excuse me, are you a college student who graduated from a physics department?

1193
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,800
I want to ask you to go back to fellow practitioners again,

1194
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
Can anyone answer?

1195
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
Are you here to be an academician?

1196
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
no,

1197
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,800
I am,

1198
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,800
I have no job and you.

1199
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
good,

1200
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,800
If you are unemployed, you also have academicians, that's right.

1201
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,800
physics,

1202
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
so physical,

1203
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,800
in deep water,

1204
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,800
The red light is absorbed,

1205
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,800
So when you see blue in deep water,

1206
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
While he waited for his ascension,

1207
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,800
A red light appeared,

1208
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,800
In other words,

1209
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,080
Water bodies selectively absorb different wavelengths

1210
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,880
Red wavelengths are absorbed at the outermost layer

1211
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,000
So did you see the red light?

1212
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,440
so it can't see red

1213
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,400
But when there is a red light on it, it sees red

1214
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,640
So to the gentlemen here

1215
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,720
if you are busy

1216
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,400
Girlfriends should never wear red this year

1217
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,360
Because it's all black

1218
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,480
she was busy

1219
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,480
don't use lipstick

1220
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,160
don't use red

1221
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,880
Because I saw black lipstick

1222
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,280
this is to tell you

1223
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,320
Optics are subject to many physical conditions

1224
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,680
especially the effect of water

1225
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,480
Someone did this experiment

1226
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,640
that is to say measure it

1227
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,800
Look, it's in the clear waters of Outer Yangxian

1228
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,120
Red light is filtered out at about 10 meters

1229
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,360
So you just saw

1230
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,120
can't see red light

1231
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,520
Must be more than 10 meters to see the red light

1232
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,840
But if you go deeper

1233
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,440
Only shorter wavelengths can penetrate

1234
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,000
But it happens to be relevant in the estuary area

1235
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,360
Because a lot of pumice

1236
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,760
So red light is not easily absorbed

1237
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,840
Instead, short wavelength

1238
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,560
The same goes for coastal areas after blue light

1239
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,400
I remember I went to the Amazon and shallow water in Brazil the day before yesterday

1240
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,720
Our shallow water regulations must have a partner body

1241
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,520
we go down and see

1242
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,560
Comparing the Amazon and Shallow Water

1243
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,900
You see your partner as if the epic is floating in front of it

1244
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,200
because your whole body becomes that

1245
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,780
so red it looks scary

1246
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,340
then you think about it

1247
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,680
If you are in an environment

1248
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,500
to be able to have so much complexity in this

1249
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,320
In the field of ecology, it is not yours

1250
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,120
Disneyland?

1251
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,180
Let me explain this

1252
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,000
But if you put the fish's eyes

1253
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,040
open it with human eyes

1254
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,600
It has two sensory cells

1255
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,160
A columnar cell looks like a columnar cell

1256
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,440
chaser cell

1257
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,020
Columnar cells are responsible for light and dark light perception

1258
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,560
Empty Sale

1259
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,840
how to keep it

1260
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,120
What about chasing cells?

1261
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,640
responsible for color

1262
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,800
The chemical reaction is mainly in this

1263
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,600
The so-called outer section is produced in this place

1264
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:05,880
Outer Auto segment

1265
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,500
Because we have three and three kinds of spaces in charge

1266
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,340
Red Green Blue Long Wave Medium Wave Short Wave

1267
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,120
So our three competitions

1268
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,940
like a palette you can see any color

1269
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,500
I came back to Taiwan 9 years ago

1270
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,020
I think

1271
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,320
This Taiwan is a

1272
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,340
Disneyland

1273
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,120
because why

1274
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,160
Although Taiwan is very small, it only has one station

1275
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,260
5/20,000 of this land in the world

1276
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,040
Only 3600 square kilometers

1277
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,840
But he has 3090 kinds

1278
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,600
fish species

1279
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,400
There are only 30,000 broadcasts in the world

1280
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,940
So Taiwan has 1/10

1281
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,000
Then there are 3,000 to 4,000-meter high mountains

1282
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,800
There is a deep sea of ​​3,000 meters here

1283
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,840
any environment you can imagine

1284
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,880
allows you to experiment

1285
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,920
A lot of comparison experiments can be done in an instant

1286
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,000
So I made a horse mouth fish in one go.

1287
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,020
Beanbag

1288
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,060
Research on Shimuyu and Sichuan-style Bottom Material

1289
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:56,580
This is

1290
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,600
Clear first-class rivers below 1000 meters

1291
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
fish this is a coastal area with a lot of fish in the estuary

1292
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
This is a relatively exotic fish

1293
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,760
It goes to the deep sea to a depth of two hundred meters

1294
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,000
So I can do so many experiments in one go

1295
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,000
of course i just said

1296
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,160
The lab isn't the happiest thing

1297
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,360
Because you're thinking, someone else did it

1298
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,320
your assistant your students help you

1299
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,960
happiness is in them

1300
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,200
Well, my lab luckily got lucky.

1301
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,360
At that time, Zhongyan gave me a good sum of money.

1302
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:32,760
We have the only one in Asia, Xian Wei Scenery and Fire

1303
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,080
what is it good for

1304
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,080
You take the fish's eye out and put it under this microscope

1305
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,360
This will have a speed of light

1306
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,720
Just lighten the background

1307
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,760
Put this background light on top of the outer segment

1308
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,760
let it produce a photochemical reaction

1309
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,960
In just ten seconds it scans from

1310
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,760
300Hz to 700Hz sweep

1311
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,280
You'll hear da da da come back da da da

1312
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,240
well, there is an answer

1313
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
This empty Sale or this RawSale

1314
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,200
What kind of light can you see? You'll know right away.

1315
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,360
but it has

1316
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,500
There are downsides, your ophthalmologist will never use this

1317
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,800
because it is destructive or not

1318
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,800
Okay, so you see, this is offset by the window stripes.

1319
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,600
we have an interesting discovery

1320
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,800
When everyone's body is 3.46 cm

1321
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,100
it's sensitive to green light you know what

1322
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,400
Ours is called Max West State Spectrum

1323
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,100
Lambda Max it's 513 and it's almost here

1324
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,000
But when it grows to 8.2 cm

1325
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,600
Its Lambda Max is moved to a place with a relatively short slope

1326
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,700
becomes 492

1327
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,800
Ours is called Spectral Shift. There is also a Special Shift.

1328
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,400
Move from long slope to short slope

1329
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,600
what does this tell you

1330
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,300
This should be 100 meters ago

1331
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,000
If you go to Lan, it will be more than 100 meters.

1332
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,000
That's if you ask a fisherman

1333
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
at what depth to catch this fish

1334
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
it will be sure to 100 meters

1335
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,400
The net must be lowered at 100 meters to catch the island collapse

1336
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,200
You can't catch it at 100 meters

1337
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,000
but what is the most fun

1338
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,400
This fish never left my lab

1339
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,600
So we then asked a question

1340
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,700
It's Generic predetermined

1341
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,000
is genetically pre-programmed

1342
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,700
Or is it because of age

1343
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,300
Is it related to body length

1344
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,000
So we also asked some of this question

1345
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Later we have a conclusion

1346
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,600
It is related to body length

1347
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
it has nothing to do with age

1348
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,400
Because you can do some manipulation

1349
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,300
Let's take that result and see

1350
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,000
That is, when it was a child, it could see green light and purple light

1351
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,400
When it grows up, it can see blue light and purple light

1352
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,400
but the most fun

1353
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,000
Take this feather and take a closer look

1354
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,800
There is actually red under this brown color

1355
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,900
But is it red at all?

1356
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,000
that actually makes sense

1357
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,100
because it never lived 10 meters before

1358
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,900
so why is it red

1359
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,000
Like you said Japanese people come out at night

1360
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,900
must wear this dress

1361
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,500
He will never wear white clothes

1362
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,600
was worn to death, right?

1363
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,600
like this

1364
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,700
well this is a very important

1365
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,900
Such a breath

1366
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,600
Of course I'm a good assistant to do

1367
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,600
We make horse mouth fish, Chusuo hot pepper, bean sprouts, green onions, earthworms, earthworms

1368
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,500
do it all

1369
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,800
Welcome to see red light, green light, blue light, purple light

1370
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,000
This is also red light, green light, blue light

1371
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
This one can only see red light, green light and blue light

1372
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Can't see UV light Why?

1373
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
why no uv light

1374
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
then i just finished

1375
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
This can only see green light, blue light

1376
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Can't you see the red light?

1377
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
then why this place

1378
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
he can't see ultraviolet light

1379
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Just see the difference in UV light

1380
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
So there is a photo to share with Gui

1381
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
This is when visible light

1382
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
This is me as a post-lock boss

1383
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
He took a picture a while ago

1384
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Then add a green mirror

1385
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Put this visible light omnidirectional paper

1386
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Now UV light can pass through

1387
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
you can find

1388
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
If a fish has UV light

1389
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
when he looked up

1390
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
what you can't see

1391
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
become a black spot

1392
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
like a whiteboard

1393
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
have a whiteboard

1394
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
There's a lot of consciousness on it over there

1395
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
so you have to eat fish

1396
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Little animals are here

1397
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
You can eat it from a distance

1398
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Then that beanie just now

1399
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
also born in the estuary

1400
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
the estuary area is hot

1401
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
very organic

1402
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
As a result you talk

1403
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
where you live

1404
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
If you still have UV vision

1405
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You see everything is a little bit darker

1406
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,300
can eat which can not eat

1407
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
then you will be busy

1408
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,800
So his evolution let him say

1409
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,100
You have no sense of UV

1410
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,600
This is a great compliment for us

1411
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,600
But the phenomenon that we have completed another test is that

1412
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,200
we did too

1413
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,300
private equity camp

1414
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,900
Then I read this

1415
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,200
Haiyan was in Donggang when he was studying

1416
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,000
My instructor, Mr. Liao, let me do a private equity camp

1417
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,900
Private equity describes some basic business research

1418
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,300
so i'm back with the first project

1419
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,060
of course just keep doing it

1420
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,660
Of course it's different this time

1421
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,360
a student to do

1422
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,260
It is very

1423
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,760
bright student he graduated from the center

1424
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,260
He came to my lab to do this master's thesis with me

1425
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,960
Published two reports in only two years

1426
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,360
He is actually in Tsinghua

1427
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,060
he is in tsinghua

1428
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,660
He can actually get a Ph.D.

1429
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,260
he didn't

1430
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,260
He is now at the National Taiwan University store

1431
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,160
I'm doing it with that teacher Chen Weiren

1432
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,860
Then he uses this sub to add 1.46 cm

1433
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,660
Then he saw red light, green light, blue light, purple light

1434
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,860
he can't see ultraviolet light

1435
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,860
Because he is not in clear waters

1436
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,060
He is in the coastal area with some lake springs

1437
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
puffy matter

1438
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
but when it comes

1439
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
13 It can see red light green light blue light

1440
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
But everyone pay attention

1441
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
purple light is gone

1442
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Then the so-called Blu-ray

1443
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It's all sort of like a shortwave shift phenomenon.

1444
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
look at this

1445
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Originally from 450 to 480

1446
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
becomes 420 to 450 only

1447
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Blue light also has a shift in green light

1448
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Red light has displacement

1449
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
What about this displacement table?

1450
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
it's out of the surface water

1451
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It has gone in relatively deep waters

1452
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
because the water is deeper

1453
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
The straighter the green the long wave

1454
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
imaging long wave short wave

1455
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
what is this

1456
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
If you want to catch this fish

1457
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
you have to scratch at the surface

1458
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
because it has been

1459
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
ecologically adapted

1460
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I want to move to the deep sea

1461
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Move in deeper water

1462
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
So this interesting experiment

1463
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
good

1464
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
then i just mentioned this

1465
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Get rid of wax and horse mouth ants

1466
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
we have done this

1467
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Mention table's reflection drama drama what it's reflection

1468
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
shoot light

1469
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
i found it interesting

1470
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
This is below

1471
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
This is blue light This is green light

1472
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Apparently it can reflect blue light

1473
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,960
Compared with the green light, it is stronger than this horse mouth

1474
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,460
And the color is darker

1475
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,160
then we ask a question

1476
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,360
They live in the same territorial waters

1477
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,600
Sympathetic in English means common domain

1478
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,360
Then if you co-domain

1479
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,360
Indicates that you accept the physical conditions obtained

1480
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,460
should be the same

1481
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,160
then why

1482
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,960
Since it has a difference in body color

1483
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,000
because it's marriage

1484
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,600
Will this marriage color cause

1485
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,160
Are they visually different?

1486
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,360
difference in visual ability

1487
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,520
so we go back

1488
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,480
Call up this data again to have a look

1489
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,360
it's fun

1490
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,080
green light

1491
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,280
Look at this red light and ultraviolet light

1492
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,440
Maximum Lambda Max absorption wavelength

1493
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,960
no difference at all

1494
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,200
no difference

1495
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,600
And you see it's green light and blue light

1496
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,680
Green light is 500

1497
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,960
This is 500nm

1498
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,120
is 423

1499
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,280
This is 486 413

1500
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,400
That's weird

1501
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,520
it lives in the common domain

1502
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,000
Everyone is in the same water

1503
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,800
no depth difference at all

1504
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,120
but it seems to tell you

1505
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,120
it should be

1506
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,880
deeper waters

1507
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,840
it's shallow

1508
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,040
那 does not make sense

1509
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,160
Because their physical conditions are the same

1510
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,960
So that choice is the same

1511
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,960
So we suspect

1512
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,760
Is it because of the marriage color that I just saw?

1513
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,000
Caused him to have this difference in color and light perception

1514
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,760
we just want to say

1515
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,040
The columnar cells just mentioned, the chasing cells

1516
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,320
He can feel light because

1517
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,040
He also has this tetraprotein

1518
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,840
Obsin

1519
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,400
There is a segment in the tetraprotein

1520
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,360
is a chromophore

1521
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,960
This pigment pack was decided to say

1522
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,560
Will this light be absorbed when it comes in?

1523
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,000
is deciding

1524
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Then the tetraprotein

1525
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,560
there must be something behind the protein

1526
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,760
There must be genes directing him to make this protein

1527
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,880
so what we know

1528
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:47,760
Vertebrates have five large tetraprotein genes

1529
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,920
This is responsible for the so-called light and dark

1530
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,160
right above our most sensory cells

1531
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,080
Then this is responsible for the green

1532
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,120
This is responsible for the blue

1533
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,640
This is responsible for the ultraviolet light

1534
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,600
this is responsible for red

1535
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,040
So total

1536
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
There are 1 2 3 1 angles is a

1537
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,000
i don't speak normal

1538
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,320
All vertebrates mostly have 5

1539
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,800
In fact, like us, we don’t have this UV.

1540
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,400
photosensitizers and others have

1541
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,920
This has already been determined in great detail.

1542
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,040
OK, let's use this method to measure

1543
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,000
What is the difference in Obsing between the two languages?

1544
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,760
Just at Marco and at this

1545
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,760
The position of the 118th amino acid

1546
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,080
It turned out to be this sour dark sour Sroning

1547
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,840
it can generate 4 copies

1548
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,520
It is sensitive to 423

1549
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,640
very sensitive

1550
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,200
But in the place where the shot is big, it is replaced by

1551
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,040
It's no longer sour it's Sroning

1552
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,640
It is Lithium Acid 413

1553
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,320
Then the place at 122 is responsible for the light filtering

1554
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,480
This is Gutame Marco

1555
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,560
It becomes 486

1556
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,880
Gutame Hulu Ansoin

1557
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,960
so interesting

1558
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,880
different color capabilities

1559
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,520
what is that

1560
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,400
English called Fino Type called phenotype

1561
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,200
Behind the phenotype, there is actually a genotype guiding it.

1562
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
We can pull this gene out

1563
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
very happy event

1564
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Then another graduate student joined

1565
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Ask Tang Mengning to join our lab

1566
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
He's a little girl with bigger ambitions

1567
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
He doesn't do two, he does four at a time

1568
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I want to say that Wang Liliang's graduation is actually very difficult

1569
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
He graduated it anyway

1570
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
published the report here

1571
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Although he only published one

1572
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
not two

1573
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
However, graduate students in Taiwan are generally rare to graduate.

1574
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
published no no

1575
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
When I was with Mr. Hang

1576
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I only publish one article in China

1577
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Taiwan fishery study only

1578
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Head to International Hanging Teacher at College Students

1579
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Now I'm a student so I won't let him graduate

1580
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
and he writes in english

1581
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
He did four pure subjects in one go

1582
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Squeeze hemp in Taiwan

1583
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You'll see this when you go to the seafood store

1584
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Squeeze Ma who looks very elf

1585
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
But I don't know how crowded it is

1586
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
why do people like to eat

1587
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
That eats too much

1588
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
i don't like to eat at all

1589
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
And Quan Shui is most afraid of this

1590
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
because you are in business

1591
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
then he hides inside

1592
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Your hand sounds and he moves his mouth

1593
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
He said why my hand is missing

1594
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
most afraid of this

1595
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
it's weird in here

1596
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,080
We had a hypothesis in our experiment

1597
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,200
hypnosis

1598
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,580
That hypothesis means

1599
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,140
According to this ichthyology

1600
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,840
These two are shallow water fish

1601
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,680
shallow water

1602
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,680
These two are marine

1603
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,240
That's not what I'm comparing to say

1604
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:19,740
Have you guessed the color and light perception of shallow water and raw sea?

1605
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,280
In theory we could Petite

1606
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,040
This should be for short wavelength

1607
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,280
This is the long wavelength

1608
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,180
As a result we do

1609
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:28,540
Hey, it is indeed a short wavelength

1610
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,940
This long wavelength is wrong

1611
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,840
This is the same group as this

1612
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,980
so tell us

1613
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:34,740
Net loss is worse than no loss

1614
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,480
So many ecologists write fish systems

1615
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,380
probably incorrect

1616
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,040
Why

1617
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,640
Because this teacher messes with teaching students

1618
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,640
I went to the fish market to buy

1619
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,540
fish market say

1620
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,680
that's amazing

1621
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,140
5000 kg is awesome

1622
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:46,940
five thousand kilograms

1623
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,140
especially five hundred kilograms

1624
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,340
He said five thousand kilograms

1625
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,740
did you know

1626
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:51,680
whatever he says

1627
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,340
so this let this

1628
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,240
This place where fish are produced

1629
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,740
Then measure it again

1630
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,940
The so-called photosensitive color

1631
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Two more groups, this is the short wavelength, this is the long wavelength

1632
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:10,000
This seems to be in shallow water again. In deep water. This is shallow water.

1633
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,640
But I told you to do the opposite

1634
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,600
So we end up kind of deranged

1635
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,000
don't care about it don't care about it

1636
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,200
Let's see if this amino acid has changed

1637
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,600
Yes, these three are hygromic acid

1638
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,160
Then this becomes the amino acid of Aranillon

1639
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,400
And this one is respiration

1640
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,200
What about these three, bone fetal life, humamine and oxine?

1641
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,400
At least we have solved the problem of this gene

1642
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,200
but what is the most fun

1643
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,400
You take this, this range and draw a color chart

1644
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,040
It can only see the painting of this Hengzi

1645
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,800
What is it? Only light green and light blue can be seen

1646
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,400
they are middle voters

1647
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,600
it's nothing special number four it's the middle voter

1648
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,200
so let them vote on tuesday

1649
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,400
This is the median voter to master

1650
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,200
Then of course we put this this always

1651
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,640
This genetic map draws it out

1652
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,400
叫Final Generic Relationship

1653
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,960
we're glad it's called

1654
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,440
Monophyte branched from a single branch

1655
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,200
Fortunately, if you draw this

1656
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,680
Then some are places that come suddenly

1657
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,280
Indicates that our data is wrong

1658
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,240
so it's ok

1659
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,760
But in addition we have

1660
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,600
This Concrete

1661
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,480
And this Angela

1662
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,520
This Baiman compares

1663
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,960
and the Americas

1664
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,160
they are very similar

1665
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:22,920
so let's say

1666
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,760
good

1667
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,600
That's indeed our answer

1668
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,720
someone asked

1669
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,640
What's the big deal

1670
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,960
so what if you study genes

1671
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,560
Actually Nothing's no big deal

1672
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,560
we just say

1673
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,160
We people to Science

1674
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,480
To Nature Curiosity

1675
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,080
We put the Document up

1676
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,040
But your data

1677
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,840
Why these Data comparison

1678
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,840
Many people are not afraid of death to do it

1679
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,000
we can compare

1680
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,640
know to say

1681
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,360
Tell us that our Data has no errors

1682
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,320
what do you think

1683
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,240
Legation Foundation

1684
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,520
Maybe someone will be smart enough in the future

1685
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,040
that is

1686
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,720
Bring out all the genes

1687
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,240
It turns out that its entire visual system

1688
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,240
what started to evolve

1689
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,720
tell you another big story

1690
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,920
We are all small screws

1691
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:58,080
Each contributes a little

1692
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,160
In the future, a big man will hand him over

1693
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Big story for you, it's like

1694
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
The money that the troublemaker pays is for us to play this fun game

1695
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Then this RH2 just now is the so-called green light

1696
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
It was blue light just now, this is green light, same

1697
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
There is such a similarity, you see it is similar to that

1698
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Anguilla, Anguilla's weekly slowness is very similar, said

1699
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
There is nothing wrong with this answer

1700
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But the funniest fish

1701
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It only has one Rothsel in charge of the case

1702
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
There is an empty Sales, it is color blind, it only sees green

1703
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
it doesn't see, it sees green street

1704
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
As you can imagine, this one turns light green to dark green

1705
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
They are all on Green Street, but what is the most fun thing?

1706
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
This fish is called Colorful Man, look

1707
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
it's so beautiful, it's blue, it's yellow

1708
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
But it can't see it, it can only see green

1709
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Then you're talking about what the hell is going on

1710
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,000
What's going on? What's the funniest thing?

1711
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:00,000
The little fish is black and yellow again, and its surname is Chen, so the so-called first attack

1712
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,840
Green and yellow, and after the bow is finished, it will change its sex and become a female, and its whole body will be yellow

1713
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,360
It can't even see the color of white awn

1714
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,680
So we write this paper is really

1715
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:16,900
I really don't know how to write it down, of course there is a paper and there is a publication

1716
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,560
Of course telling it means that we don't know how to explain this phenomenon

1717
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,680
What is the only meaning to explain the phenomenon?

1718
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:27,520
Because it's nocturnal, it can't see colors actually

1719
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,040
not a big deal, because it comes out at night as long as you can, gray street

1720
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,920
and a little green street it's ok

1721
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:38,720
But there is something in it that violates Darwin's sexual selection

1722
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,840
nature only, nature when sexual dimorphism, gender dimorphism

1723
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:43,840
that is, to recognize each other

1724
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,520
Since you can only see green light, what do you want to identify?

1725
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,400
So we have a hypothesis that says, my hypothesis says

1726
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,320
Look carefully, among the four types just now, only this kind

1727
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,480
This nostril is very big

1728
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:00,200
I rely on male or female looks when I'm pregnant to mate

1729
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Mutual destroy each other very fierce in trusting each other

1730
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,200
especially nocturnal

1731
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,400
Vision doesn't matter in nocturnal pose

1732
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,100
Chemical Q you have

1733
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:09,400
Visual and olfactory signals are fine

1734
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,900
so this is a location

1735
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:12,100
hope someone can

1736
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,300
Our paper has been drawn

1737
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,200
Someone can now Pick Up

1738
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,700
and keep doing it

1739
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,200
Then I will share with you a

1740
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,900
The project we just finished

1741
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,200
Sakura Official Documents

1742
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,600
Sakuragi participates in this conservation project

1743
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,900
Everyone Knows the Sakura Official Document Rules

1744
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,900
Since the discovery of the Japanese

1745
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,800
Also after a long time it was almost extinct

1746
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,800
Later, there was one in Sheipa Park

1747
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,400
There is a Fuyu Center in Wuling Farm

1748
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,600
These are actual ecological videos that they captured

1749
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:42,500
Then we pass permission

1750
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,100
We can give us five small fish a year

1751
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:48,300
Yes, small fish must never be caught from the river

1752
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,800
Only by artificial breeding can we get it

1753
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,700
It was given to us through the main material concept over there

1754
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,400
So we do it the same way

1755
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,600
we discover

1756
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,500
We use the expression of its gene

1757
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,000
This is

1758
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,700
When the Labus foundation was so small

1759
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,360
then bigger

1760
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,960
It's already possible to take the initiative to close the room

1761
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,360
Then juvenile looks like this

1762
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,160
Then there are two years old and then three years old

1763
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,160
we have fun watching it

1764
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,160
It can see red light green light blue light

1765
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,360
ultraviolet light

1766
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,500
that can't see ultraviolet light

1767
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,960
But when I was two or two years old

1768
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,760
Hardly detectable Undetectable at three years old

1769
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,460
So this is what confuses us

1770
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,060
why did you grow up

1771
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,660
At this point you don't want to look at ultraviolet light

1772
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:22,860
I just said it's not ultraviolet light

1773
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,860
can make that thing light up

1774
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,660
That is to say, the air conditioner is very good

1775
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:28,060
Then why here

1776
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,860
Without these ultraviolet light

1777
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,960
As a result, of course we made the sequence of its genes

1778
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,160
It can also see red light green light blue light ultraviolet light

1779
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,160
and the columnar cells

1780
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:41,960
Pacific turtle as we know it

1781
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,760
compare them all

1782
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,160
there's a difference there's a difference

1783
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,960
But it is the lightest, almost light

1784
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,960
This is Masu

1785
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,200
Owners

1786
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,200
Oncorincus Masu

1787
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:54,760
It is the tortoise feather tooth of the road style of Lake Pipa in Japan

1788
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,560
We differ from it by only one gene

1789
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,260
this one

1790
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:59,360
This 122 is just the position

1791
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,300
It also proves that what was said in the past was thought to say this

1792
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,800
Our English culture republic rule is different from Japan's

1793
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,360
P85's English-language republic rule is actually the so-called Sister Speed

1794
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,960
When it’s still Sub Speed, look

1795
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,400
And Marsu from Hong Kong Ringer

1796
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,880
In fact, it should be called Marsu Marsu

1797
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,480
Its Marsu Homo Sensor is a dental species

1798
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,800
because it hasn't been long enough since the last ice level

1799
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,400
So it's only one amino acid difference

1800
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,520
This is another proof that it is not necessary to use all post-G

1801
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,280
Our Sequence

1802
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,760
Only one Obsing G will tell you

1803
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,680
It is true that it has not yet reached the point where it can be

1804
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,960
Split the differences into two classes

1805
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,960
We will use this to draw Tree

1806
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,600
That's right, as long as you draw it, it will be placed with Marsu

1807
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,160
Footsteps with Marsu

1808
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,240
Indicates that our experiment is wrong

1809
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,800
But all our genes express

1810
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,240
It's all connected with Marsu

1811
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,880
Say we're right

1812
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,920
Same as this now I just mentioned

1813
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:50,840
One day someone will do a large-scale integration

1814
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,640
can tell us

1815
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,200
This whole Pacific gauge is an evolution

1816
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,760
Actually you don't have to get Hong G for this story

1817
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,000
Only the four-egg pendulum gene can tell us about this tour

1818
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,840
We have a very important serendipity

1819
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,400
Let's do this electron microscope section

1820
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,440
found out that it has this so-called signing arrangement

1821
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,000
The result is drawn to say

1822
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,040
This is equivalent to the sensory cell of UV

1823
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,840
Then this is divided into two pieces

1824
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,600
This is Needle Wave Lens

1825
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,400
it's green light

1826
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:21,240
This is red light red light green light red light

1827
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,200
It turned out to be before we thought it was

1828
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,360
We thought we got the experiment right

1829
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,360
But I didn't expect that two years ago

1830
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,400
Some are reported in the Institute of Companies Journal

1831
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,640
Really makes us have to keep doing it again

1832
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,360
He found

1833
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,400
light comes in from outside

1834
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,240
When the receptor cells for red light are hit

1835
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,120
There will be a refraction at the boundary

1836
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,480
Outer segment that hits the UV light

1837
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,200
what phenomenon will it produce

1838
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,200
produces a phenomenon called polarized light

1839
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,000
We don't have the ability to polarize light

1840
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,680
so i don't know what i'm talking about

1841
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,880
I will use an example

1842
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,200
what is polarized light

1843
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,400
The light comes in 360 degrees

1844
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,080
you want to make a light fry

1845
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,120
Suppose it is Vertical

1846
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Then this parallel light is

1847
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Parallel light does not turn green, only vertical waves remain

1848
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
If the character is making a parallel light

1849
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So let's talk about two green mirrors

1850
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
after two mirrors

1851
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
you see the darkness

1852
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
But if you have a corner

1853
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You can refract this to green

1854
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Then this side is the best

1855
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
just in summer

1856
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
look at

1857
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
you can't see the car

1858
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
what are you doing in the car

1859
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
but the paparazzi lens

1860
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Must have a polarizer

1861
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Because the little king of the mountain made inside

1862
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
must have been photographed

1863
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Then you buy that point-and-shoot camera

1864
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
None Polarizer

1865
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
so you see the photo taken

1866
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
not pretty

1867
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But if you spend a little money

1868
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
buy a polarizer

1869
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
just blue sky

1870
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
not blue sky

1871
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
the truth becomes the blue sky

1872
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Because of the fanning of water vapor, it is turned green

1873
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
one-way

1874
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
so bright

1875
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Well just mentioned that

1876
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Sakura ditch turtle

1877
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,000
where

1878
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
it has polarized light

1879
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
See that old Jiao Lie who wants to eat

1880
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,200
light up the background is press light up

1881
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:04,760
so it can be late now

1882
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,640
We also did a series of experiments on this flower line

1883
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,960
It's just what the flower line says it can explain

1884
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,600
Why 1 3 this has UV light

1885
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,000
Where the ultraviolet light does not show

1886
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,880
Because after this age

1887
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,840
It no longer eats these old feet

1888
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,240
It eats small insects, small aquatic insects

1889
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,640
it looks down, it doesn't look up

1890
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,040
So the UV will not reach its eyes at all

1891
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,880
So it naturally turns off the UV reset

1892
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,200
I'm still trying to find out what the mechanism for it to turn off

1893
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,800
Probably put a stop codon to stop it

1894
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,920
this is our current

1895
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,680
According to the study, I originally thought that paper could spend money on the table

1896
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,240
But the paper still has to be written

1897
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,000
But otherwise we will continue to do it

1898
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,120
And then one last funny thing

1899
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,040
pine ball fish

1900
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,440
It's called a pine ball fish and it looks like this

1901
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,600
Because it has this scale on it, it's like a pine cone

1902
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,160
So called Pinecone Free

1903
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,720
Someone Called Pinecone Free

1904
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,000
so that pineapple

1905
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,460
There are such pieces

1906
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,760
not two and a half years

1907
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:08,800
I went to the preparatory office of the Marine Science and Technology Museum in Quilombados

1908
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,100
they have a ticket over there

1909
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,640
about thirty

1910
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,940
It's interesting to see them from my side

1911
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,340
they don't look at you

1912
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,440
They've all been looking down

1913
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:20,040
Kind of like a dog looking at people

1914
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,140
what are you looking at do you know

1915
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:25,840
It turned out that there were two flower light devices under him.

1916
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,100
will run out

1917
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,100
So the opponent's lower flower light

1918
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,100
twinkle like this

1919
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,200
you have to put it in the hint

1920
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:36,100
There was an exposure of about 30 seconds

1921
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,900
you can photo this

1922
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,500
The light produced by the flower light device comes out

1923
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:42,900
The original plant stone was found in Japanese waters

1924
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,400
So called Monocentris Japonica

1925
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:46,800
because it has a single set in

1926
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,400
So called Mono Centris

1927
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,700
OK

1928
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,700
I just say

1929
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,200
What is the principle that it can be spent

1930
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:58,300
I borrowed it from Si Tongwei

1931
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,400
Because I'm not from Japan

1932
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
so you lend me a look

1933
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,500
But one unfortunately died

1934
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,900
i don't know why

1935
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Because I drugged him

1936
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:10,820
then i will borrow this

1937
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:11,800
almost died

1938
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:13,400
It's useless for you to belong to him anyway, right?

1939
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,500
is the best use of everything

1940
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,700
So let's slice

1941
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,600
just that

1942
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,800
Dean Wu said that we were in the Department of Zoology

1943
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,900
The most powerful thing to be repaired is to make tissue slices

1944
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,400
You can see that 40 years ago, it could still be used for official business

1945
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,300
just make it into this red slice

1946
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,300
This reslicing

1947
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,700
This is a Huaguang mirror

1948
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,100
Transverse section

1949
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,100
it has this papilla

1950
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,700
This meat picture looks like this

1951
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,100
This meat map is fun

1952
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,300
there are empty guns in here

1953
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,700
you see this purple

1954
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,500
is a symbiotic

1955
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,500
Colonies of photosymbionts in

1956
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,100
like cultivated rice

1957
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,500
That's it, the culture tank is in there

1958
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,500
cross section like this

1959
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:47,900
one is a colony

1960
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,100
a community like this

1961
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,100
that's fun

1962
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,100
in this laboratory

1963
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,100
I squeeze it with my hands this Papilla

1964
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:54,900
squeeze it

1965
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:56,900
like noodles

1966
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,500
Shiny noodles will come out

1967
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,900
we can take

1968
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,100
His fungus, so we found him outside

1969
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,300
Packed a whole rate of fire bag, then I saw you blink

1970
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,940
What is a twinkle? Like a curtain

1971
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,600
When he wants you to see the light, his rate of fire bag

1972
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,840
Just concentrate, and the light can pass through

1973
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,840
Like this, just because he's nervous, he's completely disengaged

1974
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,440
The light can't pass through, so he relies on the opening and closing of the curtain

1975
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:29,840
To let the other party see whether he is bright or not, just do this

1976
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,240
Then of course we said that when we just talked about it, we can squeeze it out

1977
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,640
We can raise this mushroom meat, you can use this Plate or this Bot

1978
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,240
that, just do it

1979
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:44,340
What does that soup mean?

1980
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,540
Bros, you can see that he is a relative point in the previous dimension.

1981
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:53,740
A green dot means he has symbiotic bacteria, symbiotic bacteria that can flower fluorescent

1982
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,640
This is very enjoyable, the first time I made it

1983
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,240
Wow, I'm so happy, I can finally raise it

1984
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
My assistant said next time I'm going to give a speech

1985
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,700
get me a big pitcher to that podium

1986
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,140
Then turn off the lights

1987
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:07,600
Then the face lights up

1988
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,500
my assistant said teacher

1989
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,200
That's Libre marine lake fungus, you're going to die badly

1990
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,300
then don't

1991
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,900
OK, let's take the bacteria

1992
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,600
we grow this bacterium

1993
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,640
We want to prove that this bacteria is locked

1994
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,200
In fact, this fungus was first used by weddings in 1976.

1995
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:24,800
but we know

1996
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,600
It was found in Japanese waters

1997
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,500
Mushroom Lake Bay off the coast of Tokyo

1998
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,100
So what is the difference between Taiwan and him being thousands of kilometers away?

1999
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,700
As a result, we used this 16SRNA gene to order it out

2000
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,300
The result was right

2001
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:40,500
It is actually different from the original Moyal type

2002
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,200
Then we will make the Fyrogynetic Tree of this gene

2003
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,500
Then with native

2004
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,800
Prototype to compare

2005
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,700
it falls inside the expression

2006
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,900
is the same

2007
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,900
Then we asked that industrial research

2008
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:57,500
Food Industry Research Institute

2009
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,500
we spent

2010
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,100
ten thousand dollars

2011
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
He helped us do the flower effect analysis of this hydrochloric compound

2012
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Turns out he has 1 2 3 4 5

2013
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,200
The four places are different from tire digging

2014
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,800
So we define it as new strength

2015
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,200
We have pulled it to DDPJ in Japan

2016
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,000
That is because when we want to pull

2017
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,500
The US government just shut down

2018
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,200
not let us pull

2019
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,500
We will pull it on DDPJ in Japan

2020
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,500
at least because it's head box grabbing

2021
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,900
So we have developed

2022
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,900
It turns out that there are also types of tire digging in Taiwan.

2023
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,900
In our laboratory there is a project called

2024
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,900
Spec-chofotometer

2025
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:36,900
You can put that pull directly on the flower light device to measure

2026
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:37,900
it is also its emission

2027
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:39,900
Its flower color spectrum is like this

2028
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:42,900
Then its maximum wavelength is 498

2029
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:43,900
let's ask again

2030
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:45,900
Will it fall within the range of 498?

2031
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:48,900
It can see within the scope of the eyeball

2032
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,900
So we're going to work on it too Rossel

2033
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:52,900
columnar cells

2034
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:54,900
It is most sensitive at 480

2035
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,900
Then the green light seen by the Glinn cell is at 507

2036
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,900
blue is at 42

2037
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,020
Take the silver light, light color, and spectrum in front of these three Tujia homes.

2038
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,220
fight it together

2039
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,100
look like this

2040
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:09,140
It can see green light, it can see blue light

2041
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:11,640
And then this is where to see it in black and white

2042
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:16,200
Then this is the spectrum of its flower light range

2043
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,600
just landed on this place

2044
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,840
what does that tell us

2045
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,800
This pine cone is not only looking at this silver light

2046
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,400
It also sees longer wavelengths than this silver light

2047
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,800
Places with shorter wavelengths than blue light

2048
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,520
what to see we don't know yet

2049
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,920
This is the next problem to be solved

2050
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,820
But see if it's a match

2051
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,420
it falls right here

2052
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,620
Its silver light range is in this place

2053
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:41,120
In addition, we also quantify it

2054
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:46,220
Then of course we also make the same four-bomb platinum to sequence

2055
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,720
Then we also put it on the gene bank

2056
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,620
This is equivalent to saying that one of our Zhongyan Credits has done

2057
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,920
Let people know when people are quoting

2058
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,720
This is what the Academia Sinica spent money to make

2059
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,920
Of course, we also draw the evolution map of its genes

2060
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,320
It's Pinecone this green

2061
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,260
at this place

2062
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,400
This RH1 is

2063
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,800
most...

2064
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,100
columnar cells in this place

2065
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:07,500
blue cell this place

2066
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,500
Then as I just said

2067
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,100
now this is currently meaningless

2068
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,200
It has someone to do its evolution

2069
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,600
You can use this answer to compare

2070
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,700
so far back in 1926

2071
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,100
This Japanese Okada

2072
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,200
Speaking at the Bologna Bulletin

2073
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,800
He thinks it's that flowery vision

2074
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,400
I'm here to take this...

2075
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,400
Want it to want facilities...

2076
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,500
the little animal tricked it

2077
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,100
so it can eat it

2078
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,400
but i can't do it

2079
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,300
Because we really don't know what it eats

2080
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:35,100
This fish is so desirable

2081
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,200
Then we have another point of view

2082
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,000
it's not looking

2083
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,400
They are intro-species

2084
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,900
The other party's fancy eyes?

2085
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,300
So can we design an experiment that says

2086
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,200
it may have the function of communication

2087
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,900
So how do I design

2088
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,700
We keep the fish in a small aquarium

2089
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:52,600
This is a very long aquarium

2090
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,200
a bit cruel

2091
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,800
it can't turn around

2092
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,400
stuck there

2093
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,000
Then I'm in front

2094
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,900
I put an LED light on it to see

2095
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,400
That's because it's down there and you can't take a picture of it

2096
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,000
So I put a 45 degree lens mirror in this place

2097
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,800
So reflected light we just need this night vision goggle photo to take it

2098
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,400
You don't have to take pictures of it

2099
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,000
Then let's put this light and put this LED light

2100
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,800
Do you know that this LED lamp is very powerful in Taiwan?

2101
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,800
Taiwan is a LED fusion country

2102
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,800
Its Maximum Emission is just 498

2103
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,400
ok let's see how we show it

2104
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
flash

2105
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
flash

2106
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,800
then we record it

2107
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,400
And then here's a function generator for the square volume dimension

2108
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,400
We can control how much it is

2109
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,600
plus this preceded by this

2110
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:41,200
different resistors

2111
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,000
We can measure the quality of light it can produce

2112
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,400
just with it

2113
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,600
Light Quality Produced by the Opticizer

2114
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,200
1.2 is the same as the fifth power of 10

2115
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,600
So this is to say that the light is very natural and not too strong or too weak

2116
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,800
but i tell you

2117
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,200
I'll give you how many flashes in a second

2118
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,800
will you follow me

2119
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,020
It turns out that there is indeed a limited relationship

2120
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,600
every minute it flashes five times

2121
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,960
It flashes back like sixteen or seventy-eight times

2122
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,400
And then it's thirty times a minute

2123
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,520
it can flash back to thirty thirty five times

2124
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,560
so an idea

2125
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:16,760
but very interesting

2126
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,720
lower than it does not respond higher than it does not respond

2127
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,320
Our experiment is currently done here

2128
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,000
In fact, what should be written in the Xiajing?

2129
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
It's made of Buddha's fish

2130
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,600
See if it's mating time

2131
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,720
Is there a special sex

2132
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,440
Or is it special for the director to grab the land?

2133
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,000
But this kind of fish is hard to come by

2134
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,720
And keep it in a cold room

2135
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:40,320
So I'm talking to this one from the Science and Technology Museum

2136
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,680
Master is cooperating with us

2137
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,000
It was kept in its cold room

2138
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,400
Let's find a way to work with it

2139
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,040
Do some behavioral ASA

2140
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,720
Because of your nerves, what did you do?

2141
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,520
If you don't do it and recall the behavior

2142
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,720
you don't even know what you are busy with

2143
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:54,400
You write paper for the sake of writing paper

2144
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:57,120
So this ultimate must ask this question

2145
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,360
Then I want to say the last five minutes

2146
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,360
Back to the question just now

2147
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Question How does your research help international people's livelihood?

2148
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,200
Let me tell you an example. I told this Cornell professor

2149
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,200
Alice Law, we did an experiment with Huang Jiwei

2150
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,600
Huangjiwei's wind walk is very wide, about 30 times to the north and south

2151
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,800
The sea area from 30 to 40 degrees has its windwalk range

2152
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,200
It's a little bit smaller than a prison but not so big

2153
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,000
It's as big as the black tail we eat, it's smaller

2154
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,500
But also the host is a little bit in declined down

2155
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:33,100
So the whole world is very big, and it is a headache how to maintain this group

2156
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:38,700
So in the United States, there is an Internamic American Tropical

2157
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:43,900
Where this convention is located on the Pacific coast

2158
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,900
There is a laboratory in Chotins of Balama

2159
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,500
What is it there Seedling with yellow base tail

2160
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,500
I hope that I can achieve a certain post-match

2161
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,500
It sloshes back like the ocean ranch that Lios was preaching

2162
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,500
Let God help us raise it, don't keep it in the pond

2163
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,440
Save money and know job opportunities

2164
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,480
But they haven't been very successful

2165
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,560
So there is a foundation of marriage

2166
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,600
He approached Alice and told me to go and see

2167
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,680
Because I used to work under Mr. Liao

2168
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,640
Learned the basics of farming

2169
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,680
Then Alice is a 100%

2170
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:14,840
Connell Scholars

2171
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,720
He said you just come over and we can go together

2172
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,160
Let's go

2173
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,400
our first move

2174
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,440
Just put the fish first

2175
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:22,000
Do it from 6.6 to 9mm

2176
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,120
do 80 cm

2177
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,040
0.6 cm to 80 cm

2178
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,920
see what he can see

2179
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,520
it makes sense very interesting

2180
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,600
His TwinCone only has two

2181
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,360
two aerial shots put together

2182
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,120
He is mostly looking at green

2183
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,240
Then in childhood

2184
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,360
see a lot of green

2185
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,640
But to SingleCone

2186
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,440
by the time the big fish

2187
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,520
he only sees blue

2188
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,520
what does that mean

2189
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,000
This fish is getting bigger and bigger

2190
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,080
He can move to deeper waters

2191
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,040
but very important

2192
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,640
in the infancy stage

2193
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,120
green is important

2194
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:50,760
OK, let's ask him

2195
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:51,800
what do you feed him

2196
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:53,280
feed him scale worms

2197
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,480
If the scales are eaten by a fish

2198
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,560
like this

2199
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,080
It's empty without food

2200
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,400
result

2201
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,600
If you need to use filtered water for rotation, find a species to feed it

2202
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,240
Let's use dansitometer to scan

2203
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,200
You can see that some filters are particularly obvious

2204
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,160
without filter

2205
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,080
If there is no pool to find classes in it, there will be no filter

2206
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:11,280
so what do we tell

2207
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,640
This is very important

2208
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,000
If this fish didn't see the light filter it would starve to death

2209
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,040
In the end we said we used a video camera

2210
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,440
its fluorescent lamp

2211
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:22,880
What kind of ash is it filled with?

2212
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,440
Just a little filter

2213
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:26,960
This blue is filtering

2214
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,400
no wonder it's starving

2215
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,200
because it has no filter

2216
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:33,560
It must see the filter to be able to find the

2217
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,400
This rotifer

2218
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,080
so we just say

2219
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:41,480
Is there any machine fluid T40 on the market?

2220
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,480
You see it filters so generously

2221
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,400
Relative to this area you see

2222
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,200
Doesn't it have so many filters?

2223
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,400
so you have to make people happy

2224
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,280
We do a crossover experiment

2225
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,800
Here is the ashes

2226
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,520
Here is the fluid

2227
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,680
Then see what happens if you raise it for 10 days

2228
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,960
As a result, you can see that the survival rate based on

2229
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,360
this philip is so tall

2230
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,640
It's not that they don't move well

2231
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,560
Just because there is no business in this

2232
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,000
I didn't even buy stocks

2233
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,160
declare first

2234
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,000
no , didn't take it out and say i was feeding them

2235
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,960
Tomorrow is last week's climbing

2236
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:15,520
No no

2237
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,360
it's just saying scientists

2238
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,440
We all think that this light is light

2239
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,000
wrong

2240
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,560
Once you enter, the two are completely different.

2241
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:22,520
it's another

2242
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,920
so back to basics

2243
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,080
That is to say, if your basic research is not done well

2244
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:26,920
you're wasting your time

2245
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,200
Just move, my boss will teach me how to teach

2246
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:30,920
I seem to be the way I teach

2247
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,200
it is useful to treat something

2248
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,640
If you treat Huang Qiwei, you will die

2249
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,960
They have been working on it for six or seven years and can't get it out

2250
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,840
Let's get it out one season at a time

2251
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,160
It was just a logout problem.

2252
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,000
Just change the light bulb

2253
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,040
So this doesn't mean we are great

2254
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:48,360
Because we have a good background in basic science

2255
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:50,040
good

2256
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,200
it's almost time

2257
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,960
let's review

2258
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,360
Put this photo, do you know what story I'm telling?

2259
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:59,160
do you want me to smoke some

2260
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
answer again it hides

2261
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
ok what guide is this

2262
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Then this also knows

2263
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
this ear

2264
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Then this will make a sound

2265
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
ㄉㄧㄤㄉㄧㄤㄉㄧㄤㄉㄧㄤㄉ� contributors

2266
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And this is my favorite language

2267
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I think this is Yan Hongyang

2268
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
ugliest

2269
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Well, this is our acidified

2270
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
this is that

2271
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Marine floating bacteria

2272
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Then this will play the sound of ㄉㄧㄤㄉㄧㄤㄉㄧㄤ

2273
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
do it with sound

2274
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,000
this is a puzzle

2275
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
We don't know how to solve this puzzle

2276
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
well then

2277
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Is today a feast of knowledge?

2278
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Is this a seafood feast?

2279
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Because there is a broken sieve

2280
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
This is the instruction of our dean

2281
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So we, Little Chef King, will help you cook a plate

2282
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Fried Chicken Drumsticks

2283
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Delicious dishes to share with you

2284
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
then most importantly

2285
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
back to square one

2286
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
This is our underwater dark world today

2287
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Just in time, thank you all

2288
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,900
You are right, he is indeed a master of science popularization

2289
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:07,920
The speech is brilliant, although it is a very profound scientific research

2290
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,000
But deep into shallow pearls, everyone enjoyed listening to it

2291
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,480
OK, I don't know, come please

2292
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,360
Solati today

2293
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,480
Speech Super brilliant

2294
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,200
Ask the professor two simple questions

2295
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:25,000
First

2296
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,480
that we just saw the whole school

2297
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:31,440
follow the research vessel

2298
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,360
It's like what Professor Yan said, you don't dare to cross your face

2299
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,760
face lightning step

2300
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:39,400
why is that because

2301
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,120
can't get past or

2302
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,520
Those fish they just say they understand

2303
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:46,400
order

2304
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:47,800
Know how to line up

2305
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,920
just follow the boat

2306
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,920
The second simple question is

2307
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,200
The one with the black tube nose and lips just now

2308
01:27:56,200 --> 01:28:00,040
He is obviously the doctor

2309
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,500
have bright colors

2310
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:08,500
Then why is it called black body tube nasolabial

2311
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,200
I feel that this name is worthy of its poetry

2312
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,500
I'll go back to the first one

2313
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,500
Black body tube nose lip and small is all black body

2314
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:17,900
That's why it's called black body tube nose lip

2315
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,800
But usually that is the scientific name

2316
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,100
academics have a problem

2317
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:24,100
Scholars name colors when they see them

2318
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,000
it grows differently

2319
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,700
When more than 200 people were named

2320
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:29,300
It doesn't even know that it will change sex

2321
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:31,400
it will change sex and change color

2322
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,300
so it uses a tube nose

2323
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,500
So the Taiwanese dialect sounds better and it’s called Colorful Man

2324
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,600
Colorful man

2325
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,900
the name compares

2326
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:38,700
Colorful man

2327
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:40,500
But because Colorful Man is very popular

2328
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,700
there is a shortcoming

2329
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:45,500
When I was in college 40 years ago

2330
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,300
so old

2331
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:48,800
that

2332
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,400
Taiwan's water quality pipes are on sale

2333
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,300
you can't buy it now

2334
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,300
we do this

2335
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,400
Specially imported from the Philippines

2336
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,200
Always ask for 3000 yuan

2337
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,200
So this is a big problem for a conservationist

2338
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,100
One second is only three thousand

2339
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
After doing it again, it will always cost 3,000 yuan.

2340
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,500
then answer the first question

2341
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,500
You said why he followed

2342
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,700
I'm going to ask the teacher about this

2343
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:08,600
because I was his graduate student

2344
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:09,600
just walk in front of him

2345
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,600
must follow him

2346
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,600
Nah

2347
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,600
because of his dad

2348
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:17,100
He said is it too group service

2349
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,600
That Cory is playing this way

2350
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,100
What does he want to eat?

2351
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,300
oh yes

2352
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:24,100
for food

2353
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,600
So the school of fish eats while walking

2354
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,300
right

2355
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,600
so you won't him

2356
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,000
300 meters he will not bird you

2357
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,500
Bye-Bye

2358
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,500
he left

2359
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,700
Thanks

2360
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:34,500
I understand

2361
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:34,800
Thanks

2362
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:35,200
good

2363
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,700
I am a layman

2364
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,000
don't learn this at all

2365
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,200
what i think now

2366
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,700
we speak in the country

2367
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,000
country what

2368
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,500
is social students

2369
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,200
he's talking about green

2370
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,100
right

2371
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,000
After the country has spoken, it is said

2372
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,900
we all living things

2373
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,000
whether it's warming up

2374
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,800
fetal body color god incarnation

2375
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,500
basically

2376
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,200
a living being is spiritual

2377
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:00,200
He thought we humans

2378
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,720
Speech is color, smell, touch

2379
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,400
baby nose tongue business

2380
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,460
but in your report

2381
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:10,600
It means that fish only look at color

2382
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,940
and voice

2383
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,440
it smells

2384
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:14,840
do those have

2385
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,840
Is there something you just said

2386
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,700
Behavior that cannot be studied

2387
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:22,040
Is it possible to use some other

2388
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,340
his senses to settle

2389
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,340
this is the second question

2390
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,380
The second question is why the school of fish

2391
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,800
When we do computer simulations

2392
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,760
Why do schools of fish gather together?

2393
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,300
Then it means there is mutual buying between groups

2394
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:34,800
just like us humans

2395
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,500
I work very hard

2396
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:37,960
Then it can communicate

2397
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,760
shareable like seal

2398
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,400
like a frog

2399
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,360
We use biological things directly

2400
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,160
use a computer to simulate

2401
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,860
I mean the qualities of fish

2402
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,860
Why do you mean group

2403
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,460
go to group activities

2404
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:56,060
Is it because we have each other

2405
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,220
Through this joint Bisheng business

2406
01:30:58,220 --> 01:30:59,520
communicate with each other

2407
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,020
Then

2408
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,500
Like the way you just walked, is it food-based or something?

2409
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,500
It is how to communicate and how to do it

2410
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,000
Then what

2411
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
this

2412
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I have a problem my teacher can't do it

2413
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
First

2414
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
you say

2415
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yes, I have

2416
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Because I didn't just mention that

2417
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
i can't explain that

2418
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Colorful man's problem

2419
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
it was chosen no show

2420
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Conditions where color does not play

2421
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
So I'm guessing its sense of smell is important

2422
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
So fish have a sense of smell

2423
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
taste

2424
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Lateral line sensation

2425
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and electrosensation

2426
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,000
some fish have electric senses

2427
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
so it's in

2428
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I just said it on purpose today

2429
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
dark color only

2430
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Just ask these two questions

2431
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,000
so i just

2432
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Don't talk about other things, in fact, it must return

2433
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
then the second question

2434
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
you say fish in schools

2435
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
you are simple

2436
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
if you have money

2437
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
to buy 100 fish

2438
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Keep it in your water tank

2439
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
then you turn off the light

2440
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
You hide inside and watch the fish never collide

2441
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Why is it? Because it has lateral lines

2442
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Sidelines can keep their temporal distance from each other

2443
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So you look at that Discovery or National Geographic Animal Planet

2444
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
wow

2445
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
But it never collides

2446
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
It relies on the Letal Line to keep it between the pressure

2447
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
It this me this I have done a series of experiments

2448
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
when in the United States

2449
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I intentionally use medicine to deal with this fish

2450
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Putting the function of the lateral line temporarily will

2451
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
they will all collide

2452
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Then why do they come together?

2453
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
get together and see each other

2454
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
we are together

2455
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,000
just because of the theme

2456
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
yes ! that ' s fish

2457
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Do you know what you are together?

2458
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,000
If you are a

2459
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
If you watch that movie in Africa

2460
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
If the deer is always alone

2461
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That Antlero Lingyang

2462
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Is that going to attack right away?

2463
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
then a group of words

2464
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Once it disperses, I don't know which one it will chase.

2465
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
gone

2466
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So the group has a good

2467
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
If you were with 100 fish

2468
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,660
you get caught almost 1 in 100

2469
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,860
One of the 100,000 lucks that is close to 100,000

2470
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:07,580
So why mass movement

2471
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:08,780
because you won't get caught

2472
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:10,460
You find someone to find someone in front of you

2473
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,680
you're going to die

2474
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:13,420
Right? I'm going with 100,000 people

2475
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:15,380
Look at the 200,000 people in Hongzhong District.

2476
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:17,580
can't he catch me he can't catch me can't he

2477
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:18,140
that's it

2478
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,180
mass movement

2479
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:22,900
Because you reduce your risk of being put up on

2480
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:23,300
That's it

2481
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,060
Arabic is very smart

2482
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,740
Although he did not go to any university

2483
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:27,260
But that gene is telling you

2484
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:28,980
I want to be like this

2485
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:31,180
If you look at the way of life

2486
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:32,060
Are you talking about

2487
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:33,580
For example, my husband and I

2488
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,340
it was me who gave him some favors

2489
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,660
So he wants to talk to me again

2490
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:38,460
just together

2491
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:39,580
delaying descendants

2492
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,100
what function does he have

2493
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:42,060
delay his descendants

2494
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,340
keep him alive

2495
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:44,980
oh

2496
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:46,060
This evolution is the largest

2497
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:47,940
Who can save genes

2498
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:48,660
go down at most

2499
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:49,460
just slow down

2500
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:51,460
Then this thing about giving birth

2501
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:52,580
i can talk for five hours

2502
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:53,180
can talk for five hours

2503
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,580
of course you can't finish

2504
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,700
Okay, can someone else ask the question?

2505
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,940
that's right

2506
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,220
I gave a wonderful speech and what I want to ask is the part of the 20

2507
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:06,220
just said that

2508
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:10,960
Coral reefs are affected to the extent of water sex

2509
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,840
So 20 according to your research and that result

2510
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,840
The one with all kinds of camp lights will also be affected

2511
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,340
or say curiously

2512
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,240
Then you tried it, maybe it was because of these effects

2513
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:23,740
They don't listen that hard

2514
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:27,640
Or they lack the auditory stimulation they should receive in their growth

2515
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:32,180
So it may be like the last Yang Qiwen just now

2516
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:32,980
just divide into two gangs

2517
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:34,480
Kazuoka keeps touching their hands

2518
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:37,640
He hears the stimulus and looks the same

2519
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:38,980
good

2520
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,980
very good question

2521
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:43,140
When you talk about this animal

2522
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,880
good for fish

2523
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,680
A picture of you protecting him

2524
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:49,780
his eyes will never develop

2525
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:51,280
he must be stimulated

2526
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,780
his eyes will never develop

2527
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:55,480
Then you win to find a fish

2528
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:58,580
You protect him from the environment

2529
01:34:58,580 --> 01:34:59,980
he will turn into velvet

2530
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,300
no one did this experiment

2531
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,000
In fact, it's not easy to do

2532
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Why do you only have to generate bubbles for him

2533
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,200
that's the noise

2534
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,500
that will irritate him

2535
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:15,300
You don't want to be kept in a water that doesn't cheer him up

2536
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,000
so that's a very good question

2537
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
In five years, you will do a doctorate with me

2538
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,500
We spend a lot of money

2539
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,000
but it's important

2540
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,300
Because he's a kind of Mexican K-Fish

2541
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,000
God has two forms according to him

2542
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
an iPhone an iOS phone

2543
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
don't have eyes anymore

2544
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,500
He took out his iPhone again

2545
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:37,500
As soon as he was photographed, it was difficult to raise him from the moment he was photographed

2546
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,000
There's absolutely no way his eyes can form

2547
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Then I just talked about our ears

2548
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,500
That actually has a story

2549
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,000
Our paper said

2550
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Our experiment was half right and half wrong

2551
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
We thought it was true

2552
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,500
Because it's similar to a business transaction, right?

2553
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:56,500
So ears should be affected

2554
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,000
In fact, in our paper

2555
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I deliberately don't talk about it

2556
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,880
same area to volume ratio

2557
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,880
no difference

2558
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,920
All stories are half right and half wrong

2559
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,280
Then we will talk about what it is like to be half wrong and half right.

2560
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:12,920
Because your business transactions are directly with sea water

2561
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,680
Evil thoughts hide in the ears

2562
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:15,920
have gone through inner ling august

2563
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,400
So there is a mediation boundary in it

2564
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,800
So it is immune to delay the journey of its evil thoughts

2565
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,000
But its microenvironment

2566
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,680
That tiny bowl must have had an impact

2567
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:24,680
But the benefits

2568
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,960
you didn't finish the experiment

2569
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:28,600
Because you take the Pay-Pay publisher and you can ask for money

2570
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:31,040
So Director Xu and I are going to get a sum of money

2571
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:32,800
Buy a very sophisticated instrument

2572
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,880
That probe can go right into the ear

2573
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,680
Measure its pH

2574
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:37,240
Now we are doing this

2575
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:38,800
Because there happened to be a National Science Council plan

2576
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,480
Let's buy the machine with the money Director Xu gave me.

2577
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,920
Otherwise, that machine would cost hundreds of thousands

2578
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,080
To come from Japan for our project

2579
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,480
Specially do that PoV

2580
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,480
That was supposed to do that premature amount

2581
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,080
monit's preterm co-administration

2582
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,680
He forgot me. Such a small fish can do it.

2583
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,280
the story is

2584
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:57,080
That far-off story because Pay-Pay is half right

2585
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,120
half right half wrong story

2586
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,440
So, is there any problem? Please come here.

2587
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,440
left

2588
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:09,640
press that black

2589
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,020
Hello, Mr. Yan

2590
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:14,080
It is about the change of the pH value just now

2591
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:17,880
For that fish it might be less afraid of that

2592
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,320
That Noise from Color Rift during the day

2593
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:24,880
Then the control variation we made is the pH value of the seawater?

2594
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,720
The result we see is

2595
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,920
It won't be afraid of that daytime noise

2596
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,920
Maybe a sign of danger

2597
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,120
what about the middle

2598
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,800
Your inference is that the pH might make it

2599
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,520
suffering from hearing loss

2600
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:39,120
Then it is not so afraid of this noise

2601
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,960
But is the inference in the middle possible?

2602
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:43,160
it is also possible

2603
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:47,200
The PH value may cause it to be inaggressive

2604
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,040
Then I'm not so afraid of that noise

2605
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,840
So how do we confirm that the pH value is indeed measured through

2606
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:55,240
its hearing affects its behavior

2607
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:59,040
Not so afraid of the Noise of Color Rift during the day

2608
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,240
do you want to do some more

2609
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,400
The further one is the anatomy near the ear

2610
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,900
or neuronactivity

2611
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,900
and then be able to put the front of the story

2612
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,200
pull to the middle to the back

2613
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,600
Then how did you string this thing together?

2614
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,900
This is a very good research material for lamp chains

2615
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:18,500
nice that's a good point

2616
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:19,500
this is how we are

2617
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:20,700
experiment sometimes

2618
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:25,400
You can't take Title Factor into account at the same time

2619
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,300
In fact, this is the first one

2620
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:29,200
Steve Simpson's PhD thesis

2621
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,900
If you're done forever

2622
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,600
everyone must

2623
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:34,500
In the UK, it takes three years to get a PhD

2624
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,800
so sometimes you just have to look and say

2625
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,500
Take it when you are healthy

2626
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:39,400
Then get well

2627
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:42,800
Then it is very brain new noble to find

2628
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,300
so send it out

2629
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:46,500
If you say you procrastinate

2630
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,000
If you want to finish the lab

2631
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,500
If someone else makes your paper, it has no value for publication

2632
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,600
people will not accept

2633
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,000
that student will not be able to graduate

2634
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,100
so sometimes it's

2635
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:58,300
There are short-term and long-term wars

2636
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,200
mid-term considerations

2637
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,100
Then the student wants

2638
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,640
You must hurry up and let him graduate

2639
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:02,960
just throw him out

2640
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:03,960
but you are very right

2641
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:05,840
You want too many factors can

2642
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,920
In fact we are now applying for this

2643
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,480
I'm writing the plan to teach the national science at the end of the society

2644
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,960
We're going to do his effect on the sense of smell

2645
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,880
should be on the sense of smell

2646
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,040
Because we've now made an electro-osmogram

2647
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,720
Called Electro-Effectogram

2648
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,200
happened in different

2649
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,240
In fact, there is another Pay-Pay

2650
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,360
has been accepted

2651
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,960
will be published next year

2652
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,600
give him a different acid test

2653
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,840
final low acid words

2654
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,160
It affects Effectuality Q

2655
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,160
Many animals are actually in Home-In

2656
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,000
It's Selot-Dunk like this

2657
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,240
it needs to be warm

2658
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:39,120
Smell it's Selot-Dunk down

2659
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:40,400
Such as the simplest example

2660
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,200
female force

2661
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,640
why it implants

2662
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:45,160
People say as long as you hang a female force skewer

2663
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,080
it will come

2664
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:46,960
it's wrong

2665
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:48,920
If you don't have this female power

2666
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,000
there's nothing alive around

2667
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:50,920
it won't come

2668
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:52,560
So what is Mareism?

2669
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:57,200
It has Sense to bug

2670
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,400
This is Chocoflu

2671
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,360
when it moves

2672
01:39:59,360 --> 01:39:59,880
it will say

2673
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,400
This glue stone will secrete this metabolic substance

2674
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,240
so he thinks a lot of people live in this place

2675
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,760
So I built my house on someone else's roof

2676
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:10,720
cover as a building

2677
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,080
Then I can set it down

2678
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:13,200
But if he says

2679
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,760
He becomes the stage of free living to set it down

2680
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,680
He's probably only three to seven days old

2681
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:18,640
he didn't set it down

2682
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:19,520
he will die

2683
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,400
So he used a chemical cue for smell

2684
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,200
so you just said

2685
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,640
we have the possibility that he won't come

2686
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:26,640
maybe chemical cue

2687
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,400
But why do we dare to say that

2688
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,680
Because we don't have chemical cue for

2689
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:31,520
Then we just play the voice to him

2690
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,160
yes will come

2691
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:33,520
So we might be able to

2692
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:34,480
very safely say

2693
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,880
He did because of the acoustic cue

2694
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,560
He will do this only because of the sound

2695
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,880
If only we could play chemical cue

2696
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,240
Let's see if he makes a difference

2697
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:44,080
Or say two combined interaction

2698
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,200
These two facts

2699
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:45,920
possible interaction

2700
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,600
I would think there must be interaction

2701
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,840
Just for the sake of degree, the damage is relatively large

2702
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:50,880
then i think

2703
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,120
We have just been accepted for this paper

2704
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,040
In fact, the sense of smell is quite impaired.

2705
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,000
very fast

2706
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,360
and very cute

2707
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,800
in about an hour

2708
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,080
you can measure that result

2709
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,060
Hearing will take a while until we see us

2710
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:06,260
Although we say 21 days, in fact, we can’t see it from both sides of the strait after 15 days

2711
01:41:06,260 --> 01:41:08,260
It won't be seen until the 21st day

2712
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:10,260
answer you like this

2713
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:14,460
Do you have any questions?

2714
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,460
come here again please

2715
01:41:16,460 --> 01:41:18,460
then ask one more question

2716
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:21,460
It's the last mention of Huang Qiwei

2717
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,460
I heard that several years ago Japan

2718
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:27,460
Or is it because you have black-tailed sheep near Mainland Affairs Island

2719
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,460
It's all artificial

2720
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:31,460
get it done

2721
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,460
I don't know when to raise black-tailed sheep

2722
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:35,460
because watching the news

2723
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:37,460
I didn't see some articles

2724
01:41:37,460 --> 01:41:41,460
I encountered the same light problem as raising Huang Qiwei

2725
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:43,460
I don't know why

2726
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,460
Does the teacher have any information?

2727
01:41:45,460 --> 01:41:49,460
If I want to flash this, I have to ask my teacher to help me answer it.

2728
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:51,460
Ask academicians to help me answer

2729
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:53,460
Blacktails are all about farming

2730
01:41:53,460 --> 01:41:55,460
should be here recently

2731
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:57,460
Thanks

2732
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,400
it's not a gen 2 problem

2733
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,260
Has now become vegetarian

2734
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:05,460
market problems

2735
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:09,180
Yes, but just that

2736
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:10,980
The one that Mr. Yan mentioned

2737
01:42:10,980 --> 01:42:13,180
That's Huang Qiwei

2738
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:17,100
Because the bandwidth consumed by the lamp is wrong

2739
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,180
so it's not good

2740
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:20,300
But look at the University of Economics

2741
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,580
They have been like this for decades

2742
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,700
Doesn't seem to have seen any news saying

2743
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:24,980
while they were researching

2744
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:28,900
There is something wrong with the light of the fish farm

2745
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:30,760
Because they all use the gimmick

2746
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,860
strong green light

2747
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:37,060
I come back really I put our Taiwan

2748
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:38,540
This light has been swept once

2749
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:39,700
there is a difference

2750
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,020
Every label has a different pick

2751
01:42:42,020 --> 01:42:43,620
so next time you have to do fish farming

2752
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:46,980
You have to pay special attention to your wavelength is very important

2753
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,980
That Japan should be using the headlines, right?

2754
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:50,580
The headline is very broadband

2755
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:52,020
So the wider the better

2756
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:56,460
we don't know

2757
01:42:56,460 --> 01:42:57,620
come on the one behind

2758
01:42:57,660 --> 01:42:58,820
Thank you professor for your speech

2759
01:42:58,820 --> 01:43:00,060
I want to ask a recent

2760
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,560
that thing in korea

2761
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:07,160
It's because I saw him at Academia Sinica a while ago.

2762
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:10,240
displayed as if his WireType was the same as that

2763
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,520
just say pass

2764
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:12,800
choose the total

2765
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:14,080
After the general election

2766
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:14,840
like

2767
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,380
The one for WireType

2768
01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:17,660
Relatively active

2769
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,960
Of course that one is a bit fatter.

2770
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:22,280
Of course, meat may be sold at a higher price in the market

2771
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:23,040
but

2772
01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:26,880
Comparing the two, which one is better in his evaluation?

2773
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,800
ask my teacher to answer

2774
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:37,420
How about it

2775
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:39,800
please

2776
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,340
I just didn't listen fully

2777
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,360
You are

2778
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,400
Say it again

2779
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,220
right microphone

2780
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,020
It's Taiwanese

2781
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,580
It is through selective breeding or

2782
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:56,880
maybe by changing some genes and then

2783
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,420
is his breed

2784
01:43:58,680 --> 01:43:58,880
that is

2785
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,080
Fat is heavier and bigger

2786
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:05,400
But there seems to be no activity

2787
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:06,880
Those of the Y type

2788
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:09,600
It looks more active

2789
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:13,440
And then there's that kind of thing

2790
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,560
From a consumer point of view

2791
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,760
or maybe that's fatter

2792
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:22,520
just sell for more money

2793
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,080
But from this kind of species

2794
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,480
That is to say, from the perspective of Chuanguo's situation

2795
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,680
Maybe the Y type is better

2796
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,040
you mean

2797
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,560
This Next Generation of Domesticate

2798
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:36,920
is not quite

2799
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:39,480
not quite that

2800
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:40,920
not quite

2801
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:44,160
No comparison with this Y type

2802
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,400
Yes or no

2803
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:48,560
compare this

2804
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,640
The one I saw was shown like this

2805
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,440
Y type is very active

2806
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,120
but smaller

2807
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,480
If it means from the point of view of farming industry

2808
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,040
Maybe it's that kind of comparison

2809
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Fat and heavier will be better

2810
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Can be sold much shallower

2811
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
a lot of money

2812
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
But

2813
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
From this living force of the species

2814
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:09,000
look

2815
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I feel like

2816
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
The power of the Y type

2817
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
just compare

2818
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:16,000
SV is a bit stronger

2819
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I don't know what your type is

2820
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
but

2821
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
i can do this one

2822
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
another comparison

2823
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Manyuan

2824
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
this natural garden

2825
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
out for comparison

2826
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
SV point

2827
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
relatively weak

2828
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
we start from

2829
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
give it

2830
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
that

2831
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
best example

2832
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
that sea green

2833
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
that sea green

2834
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
sea ​​green

2835
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
sea ​​green

2836
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:42,000
past fellow fishermen

2837
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
grab it

2838
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
it's not tasty

2839
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
give away

2840
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
If starting to feed

2841
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
use plenty of this oil

2842
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Oil

2843
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,000
fee

2844
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
it's delicious

2845
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
so many things are

2846
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
not necessarily what you said

2847
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
that

2848
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Domestic

2849
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,440
or WireTab

2850
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,600
So it depends on the type

2851
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:09,440
And look at the continuous improvement of technology

2852
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:15,280
So tomorrow is better than today

2853
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,440
right

2854
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:19,440
Let me add to what Mr. Liao said

2855
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,920
It is better to compare the difference between mountain base and feed base

2856
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,800
Put the mountain genes in motion for it

2857
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,240
Very muscle, very muscular

2858
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:28,440
but a lot

2859
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:30,600
But the feed base is eaten there every day

2860
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,800
Just like me eating more and getting fatter

2861
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:34,600
Aerobic belly is too big

2862
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,800
I'm sorry I'm feed-based

2863
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,280
most

2864
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,880
But which one do you say is better

2865
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:40,600
I see how

2866
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:44,200
You put the wild into the man-made environment

2867
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:45,040
it may not live well

2868
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,880
Because it feeds on natural food

2869
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:49,120
it does not eat artificial food

2870
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,800
You put the artificial ones outside

2871
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,280
it smells dead

2872
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,240
It doesn't know how to get to the secret room

2873
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:55,080
its born from

2874
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,400
It's all feed base placed in front of you

2875
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,080
It even said what the medicine said

2876
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,080
I don't want to eat such a rotten thing

2877
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
I eat, right?

2878
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
So this depends on from which angle you look at this matter

2879
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Each has its pros and cons

2880
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
here he has a problem

2881
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Come on, Mr. Zhu

2882
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
he's fucked

2883
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,000
He asked me a deep question

2884
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Look at what he didn't pass the exam

2885
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
No because just now I thought I was asking that

2886
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
or why is it blue

2887
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Think of that Lambert's Gate

2888
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
so he's right

2889
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
It's just that his level is too high, I can't understand

2890
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
No because I've just been recording that

2891
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
He is a very responsible teacher

2892
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Take a student to listen to science popularization and do science exhibitions

2893
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Taiwan needs this kind of teacher

2894
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Don't say it's just stuffing students

2895
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I think this man has admired him for many years

2896
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
I ask one is

2897
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Teacher Yan’s previous speech said

2898
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
That not aunt is the seedling of many kinds of fish

2899
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,000
But the relative fisherman I went to blue

2900
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
They always thought it was a fish

2901
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
But he is so small

2902
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
he just told me

2903
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,520
Say you go and see for yourself, those thousands of little fish all look the same

2904
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:08,360
Then my curiosity is whether these groups

2905
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:15,120
If Mr. Zhao Yan said these are small fishes of some types of fish

2906
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,480
Is it because I couldn't recognize its type when I was young?

2907
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,320
If you are, I told Teacher Liao before

2908
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,520
We all have to collect that fry

2909
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:25,480
You collect it and you can't tell the difference

2910
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:26,720
except when you raise it for a while

2911
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:28,880
This is this, this, this, this

2912
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,240
Then the little teacher over here, the young teacher Shao Huangzao, made a key

2913
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:35,280
Use the life barcode of the eight Kou to make it

2914
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,640
Dozens of kinds

2915
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:41,360
There was a year when we installed the G7

2916
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:44,880
Kornel called that Alice Lo to come with me to Wushi Port

2917
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,880
What did he say, that this is a small fish, he said a kind of

2918
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,320
I said it's easy, I'll just grab a handful

2919
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:54,480
Tell the lady boss how much, she said 15 yuan

2920
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,480
We're sorting at that table with chopsticks

2921
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,920
There are more than forty kinds, don't come

2922
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,800
You said it's possible to be single

2923
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,940
If he is a Japanese body, it will be produced in April and May

2924
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:09,100
That's the dean of nursing

2925
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,240
How many tons come in like this

2926
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,200
Then wait, you were single at that time

2927
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:14,480
But usually you look at 45, June

2928
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,140
It's all his eel's ring season

2929
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:17,880
You can't mix that seedling

2930
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:21,240
Especially that one net score with that like that Manda

2931
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:24,880
Like that mosquito net, that yellow mosquito net, catch it

2932
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,000
that's wrong

2933
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,500
So there should be a fishing season

2934
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,640
The best ratio is what I said

2935
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:31,440
Kill all the kids before you become a doctor

2936
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,640
you want him to be 20 years old

2937
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,240
before?

2938
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,740
The best ratio is this

2939
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,640
But you said there is only one possibility

2940
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,640
It's a certain day, a certain two gifts

2941
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:42,840
Two days and three days happened to be Anchovy

2942
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:44,440
The Japanese body just finished giving birth

2943
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,640
You caught just one kind

2944
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:46,940
But usually it will never be like this

2945
01:49:46,940 --> 01:49:48,940
Single is mixed

2946
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:50,340
Because everyone's reproductive season

2947
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:51,340
because it's spring

2948
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:54,140
You said the water temperature has risen in spring

2949
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:55,940
more plants than animals

2950
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,640
So we all go down together

2951
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:00,140
To be able to grab the best reproductive season

2952
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,200
So you say I don't think there's very little chance of that being a single species

2953
01:50:04,200 --> 01:50:05,600
With so many varieties in Taiwan

2954
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:08,400
You see, there are more than 3,000 kinds of fish in Taiwan

2955
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,800
its light on the east coast in april may

2956
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,200
Almost all fish are giving birth

2957
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:14,800
So if you want a single type, the chances are very small.

2958
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,200
You can visit Wushi Harbor next time

2959
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,400
Minebrawler go check it out

2960
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,800
You're an outsider who can tell

2961
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,400
That's dozens of fish over there

2962
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,800
unless he

2963
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,200
It may have been picked

2964
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,200
good

2965
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:33,200
Ask that Professor Yan again

2966
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:36,800
Yan Xu just mentioned Brahi in the body of the teacher

2967
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,800
Then we mean that there are many people who say

2968
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:41,400
Brahi is so small, don't eat it

2969
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,200
wait until it grows up

2970
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,800
Become a big fish and eat again

2971
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,000
so don't buy Brahi

2972
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,400
Because buying is equal to what

2973
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,200
That waist fold makes the fish waist fold

2974
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,400
this is not good

2975
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,800
Is it really

2976
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:55,000
depending on your point of view

2977
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
teacher japanese words

2978
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:57,600
I tell you

2979
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,600
because i came back that

2980
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,000
My senior too

2981
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,600
It was Hu Jianzhang’s senior Zhao Guangzhao who took me to do a Taipower project

2982
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,660
mid-April

2983
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:09,980
Japan mentioned that Taiwan is far away and difficult to come

2984
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:13,060
A nuclear power plant can suck in four tons and five tons a day

2985
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:15,360
just that little sucked in

2986
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,680
Those with four tons and five tons were hit and died.

2987
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:21,240
But when the resources are so abundant

2988
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:24,060
You will never run out of resources by using it

2989
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,880
Is the reasonable Blossom contract application

2990
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,920
Let it have this app called sustainable

2991
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:30,460
If it lasts, it is reasonable

2992
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:32,260
all you have to do is say

2993
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,820
like telephony that's the worst

2994
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:38,140
Then this is not a reasonable flowering. I think it is a reasonable flowering.

2995
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:39,940
or we

2996
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:46,340
Is there any interest in immigrating to live, right? You want to survive and not cause excitement, I think so

2997
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,920
Dementia organization Yuyue institute and Shuishi institute both

2998
01:51:50,440 --> 01:51:53,000
Try our best to say what plan our resources need

2999
01:51:53,460 --> 01:51:56,540
I was in Japan for two months last year and I was very emotional

3000
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,580
That means I go to the fish market every day

3001
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,560
My next photo is so big

3002
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,340
we in taiwan may

3003
01:52:04,340 --> 01:52:05,160
without you listening

3004
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,140
That's because he was dragged up with the bottom mop caught by the micro-net

3005
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:12,760
Then go to the kindergarten and kill the elementary school

3006
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,760
Japan is like this every day

3007
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:17,760
I said go there why do you weigh two or three kilograms every day

3008
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:18,760
he said first

3009
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:21,260
He doesn't have to limit you

3010
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,260
He limits the size of your fish trench

3011
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,260
you ditch absolutely

3012
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:28,260
Big fish, big fish, big ditch, no small fish

3013
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:31,260
He stipulated that the ditch is so big that only this fish can fall

3014
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:33,260
So only this big fish will not fall

3015
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:36,260
You dare to drop such a small fish in return

3016
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:38,260
you will be dropped

3017
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:40,260
Or make it possible to be a fish

3018
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,260
So let me unfold every day

3019
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:44,260
Our Taiwan seals are all so small

3020
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:46,260
I'm the one who drags the bottom and drags it up

3021
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,260
Because when I was a child, I had such a big seal

3022
01:52:48,260 --> 01:52:49,260
that's all for now

3023
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:50,260
every time i go to the mayor

3024
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:52,260
I really want to beat him to death

3025
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:53,260
what to do

3026
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,260
You are so young to eat what your brother eats

3027
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:56,260
right

3028
01:52:56,260 --> 01:53:00,260
That is, our fish certificate agency did not issue

3029
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,300
We fishermen suck too, to put it bluntly

3030
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:03,900
We fishermen are just saving money

3031
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,400
anyway i don't catch

3032
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,700
Then others will catch it

3033
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,300
That's the mentality

3034
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:09,760
I think Mr. Liao was born

3035
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:11,500
I have been his student for so many years

3036
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:14,700
I know this we are really heartbroken

3037
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:17,200
So otherwise you can still buy and eat

3038
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:17,700
that is

3039
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:20,300
Or you don’t want to buy anything else if you buy a career

3040
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:20,900
no

3041
01:53:20,900 --> 01:53:22,000
Otherwise I can't eat

3042
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:22,900
depends on the type

3043
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:24,300
when can i catch

3044
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:25,900
Then there should be something to say

3045
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:28,700
It's the two weeks when Japan is in full bloom

3046
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:30,100
open to catch

3047
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,300
Can't catch two weeks ago and two weeks later

3048
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:33,600
for example me

3049
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:35,600
When I was studying, my teacher

3050
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:37,600
Marine Resource Conservation

3051
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:38,600
texas

3052
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:43,000
The Gulf of Mexico is the place with the most red and white shrimp in the world

3053
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:43,900
But on July 8th

3054
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,300
If you have one, you won't let me catch you

3055
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:46,700
because of the reproductive season

3056
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,400
he would rather let

3057
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:49,600
much to

3058
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,800
I dare not say that people will not sink if they step on it.

3059
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,100
but he

3060
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,800
You go all over the world to buy and eat

3061
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,300
But my door can't move

3062
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,500
That is a strategic resource

3063
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,800
My family has food

3064
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:00,200
so I

3065
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,460
you can bloom, you don't have to eat, I have to eat

3066
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:04,700
This is a country with a long-term plan

3067
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:06,560
But in the long run, you need to invest a lot of money abroad

3068
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,600
to feed a lot of scientists

3069
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,000
As long as our country is unwilling to support scientists

3070
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,600
This is useless anyway

3071
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,200
Otherwise, all of you have done applied research

3072
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:17,200
This basic research resource survey

3073
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:19,760
resource-based survey

3074
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:21,960
It may be used in 20 years, it may be used in 30 years

3075
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:24,600
So it's a very long-term plan

3076
01:54:24,600 --> 01:54:28,460
Only in the future can we guarantee the source of our food

3077
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:31,420
So we say that Taiwan has already imported

3078
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:34,160
Our bootstrap rate is less than 30%

3079
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,380
that's dangerous

3080
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,720
The bootstrap rate is less than that...

3081
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,320
otherwise the danger

3082
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:41,660
It's a national security consideration

3083
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:43,820
If ten thousand changes

3084
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:45,460
Where do we go, people don't sell you money

3085
01:54:45,460 --> 01:54:46,860
What do you do if you don't sell it?

3086
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:49,320
So I think our resources must be planned very carefully.

3087
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:52,620
But it's unacceptable... It's a pity

3088
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:55,380
For 40 years we haven't protected you from resources business

3089
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:57,460
It's all pollution caused by cooperation with surgery.

3090
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:59,920
You can watch me shoot that...

3091
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,760
See Taiwan, look at the Cingjing Farm

3092
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:04,320
And that Liuqing

3093
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:08,220
Looks like you're gonna cry, and that Grandpa Electric Creek

3094
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:10,080
It's all the brown water of the Yellow River.

3095
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,080
This is our problem

3096
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,820
So in Taiwan, in terms of our ecology in Taiwan

3097
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:18,280
Best for ecological protection

3098
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:21,220
That is to say, how do we eat Brady?

3099
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:23,720
Is it eaten all year round or only in

3100
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:26,600
eat in april

3101
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,360
Brady doesn't have it all year round

3102
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:32,160
He's only unless you say April grab him and move him

3103
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:34,240
Then release it slowly

3104
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,960
Then marinate him too

3105
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:39,640
That's okay, but I just want to have one

3106
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,680
policy has a specification

3107
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,800
That is to say regulate fishermen

3108
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,120
But did you know that some of Taiwan is elections?

3109
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:49,520
When we arrived, the fishery belonged to the fishermen and they said

3110
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,960
You are not allowed to catch me, you will disappear if you do not give me votes

3111
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:55,080
So we just eat up the next generation with this generation.

3112
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:57,920
So it's good for us to have fewer birthrates, they won't be hungry

3113
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,200
they don't eat that much

3114
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,800
What we say now is that if you can’t see it, you can still buy it and eat it.

3115
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:11,600
I'm afraid it will be difficult for Mr. Yan to tell you an absolute

3116
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:13,240
Xu mainly answers

3117
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:14,400
Xu main answer?

3118
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,840
Because I was afraid of destroying the ecology

3119
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:19,880
I'm afraid that I can eat small fish in the future if I don't have one

3120
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:24,320
So try not to dare to buy and eat

3121
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:27,440
Then I just heard from Professor Yan that

3122
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:31,920
You didn't eat that fish in April, that is to say

3123
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,320
He won't waste it if he doesn't eat it

3124
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:35,680
He has become part of the food chain

3125
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:37,800
So it's still healthy

3126
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:39,480
but you mustn't feel

3127
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:41,880
But that's delicious too

3128
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:42,400
yes

3129
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:43,760
because of supplementary cover

3130
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:45,040
Organic cover is good

3131
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,000
right

3132
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,040
And it's good for children to eat

3133
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,840
The little ones eat very well

3134
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:51,440
won't eat

3135
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,840
How would you know without you not making time

3136
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:55,320
There should be twins, one should not eat

3137
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:57,120
one for him to eat

3138
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,240
Yes, then your child will hate you to death

3139
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:06,240
Why won't you be assassinated this time?

3140
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:07,240
Yes

3141
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:11,640
Well, because of time, but we are really very

3142
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,320
one last question , well one last question

3143
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:17,920
That Professor Yan I have a real problem now

3144
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,520
In Taiwan, because of that landslide

3145
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:23,240
And our farmland is near the sea

3146
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,920
So the extended pesticide product

3147
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,920
Add our Nongbo

3148
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:31,080
I heard that after 40 or 50 years

3149
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:34,640
Eat fish, only the rich can do it

3150
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:38,560
So in the future we will definitely need a lot of that kind of breeding

3151
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:42,000
to supplement the needs of this market

3152
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,560
I was thinking, Mr. Yuan, you must be a reliable medicine store, right?

3153
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:51,560
If you want to do farming

3154
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:54,360
You should be a reliable medicine storehouse.

3155
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,680
breeding

3156
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:58,320
Let me tell you, it's called a double-edged sword

3157
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,160
WHSO, everyone benefits

3158
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Because of you, your role is to breed unless you raise it in the open sea

3159
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Even on the coast, you Xiangwang, you know that there are chaos under Xiangwang

3160
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
That is to ferment and grow flowers

3161
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Then when you farm at such a high density, the shreds will grow up

3162
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,000
You have no way to describe it, because this is sea water, why do you want to describe it?

3163
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
This is a then you say capital cartoon

3164
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Taiwan is not suitable for farming like that Xiangwang

3165
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Because we don’t have Settler Nankai, Lai Huilie and childcare like Japan

3166
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
it has wind and waves

3167
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
There is almost no such environment in Taiwan, and almost all the breeding outside the breeding is not very successful.

3168
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Seriously, there are very few who didn't succeed

3169
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,000
The Tianhe in Penghu was considered quite successful, but it suffered from the cold a while ago

3170
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Because the water is shallow, the big air conditioner is here to stir up the cold water

3171
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
it's eunuch stone

3172
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:54,000
So what is the disadvantage of this and another breeding

3173
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
it's called feed

3174
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:58,000
What is the feed? For example, fishmeal is the most used food.

3175
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
put that again

3176
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,120
Arjuntina, those fish from chile are used for grinding

3177
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:07,480
Hairy those things, go back to Corey’s whole powder and feed it

3178
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:11,400
In fact, those fish can be eaten at ordinary times

3179
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:13,360
But now you use it to feed seniors

3180
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,200
Hey that lives in the landowner mansion in the facility

3181
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:20,200
So this is not absolutely a good way

3182
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:21,960
What is the best way?

3183
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:25,080
The material is in C-forming, which is ocean wood

3184
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:29,360
You protect the environment well, you release the seedlings

3185
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:32,880
Let it go secret naturally, and then repair it in an appropriate amount

3186
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,800
Let it be in balance with the ecology forever

3187
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:36,280
This is the chaos, it should be

3188
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:40,120
Rather than breeding just can be rescued not the long-term solution

3189
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:43,640
The first one, and the other one, if you assume that mariculture is raised on land

3190
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,720
When you come in, the seawater will penetrate the surface and cause damage

3191
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:52,680
Just like baby milk powder will be knocked off by meal milk

3192
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:58,400
These are all risks, as well as Wenfeng Village and Jiadong Village, which were originally settled in Pingtung

3193
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
This is the price you have to consider to pay

3194
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
So it is most reasonable to say

3195
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:08,000
make your environment healthy

3196
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Then use C farming to go out

3197
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Then you decide to collect it

3198
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Then also set a

3199
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
The size of the network that can be captured

3200
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
you won't notice

3201
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
I think this is a

3202
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
solution

3203
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
there is another very important

3204
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
A citizen wants to slip

3205
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
i really i remember seeing the world so country

3206
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Taiwan is a very slippery country

3207
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
In terms of language, no matter what level

3208
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Because the whole angle is seen from the big

3209
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
No hand slipping above, no hand slipping below

3210
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
So I guess our whole national deal

3211
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
still need to improve

3212
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
But of course that has nothing to do with my scientific research.

3213
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
But everyone because

3214
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Referring to the whole society

3215
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,000
we have to live

3216
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
To live a high quality environment

3217
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
how to live

3218
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,000
this is very important

3219
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Thanks

3220
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Ruined

3221
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Ruined

3222
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I just soaked him

3223
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
this last time

3224
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I actually thank the teacher

3225
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Charming and wonderful performance

3226
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Actually, I mainly want to respond to

3227
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Because the discussion on Aunt Blair's topic is quite heated.

3228
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Then I myself work in a medical institution

3229
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Then I want to say that it’s good to have a lecture, right?

3230
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Then ask the teacher to help me listen to it

3231
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
because you just asked

3232
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Can Aunt Brad eat it?

3233
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
In fact, we are

3234
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
It is when the nutritionist in the hospital is doing health education

3235
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
He actually mentions

3236
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Because of the current issue of heavy metal pollution and ocean pollution

3237
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Actually quite serious

3238
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
The nutritionist is suggesting that

3239
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Because everyone knows that eating fish is good

3240
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Now because that heavy metal is

3241
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,000
the pollution problem

3242
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
The nutritionist will suggest that it is good for us to eat fish

3243
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
But it's good to eat fish of the size of Bachang

3244
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
The main fish because the oversized fish

3245
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:46,000
It actually lives in the sea for a long time

3246
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
So it is relatively

3247
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
It is more polluted

3248
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Then its internal organs will actually be graded

3249
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Quite a heavy metal substance

3250
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
There is another saying

3251
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Why can eight long-sized fish be eaten

3252
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
because you at least when you're cooking

3253
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
will remove that gut

3254
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:03,600
So relatively speaking, the pollutants you eat are relatively small.

3255
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:07,660
Why doesn't Aunt Bora not eat it because you can't dig that one out

3256
02:02:07,660 --> 02:02:09,740
So relatively speaking, Aunt Bora, you have so many

3257
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:12,860
Then eat a relatively high content of genus

3258
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:15,100
Then I don't know if it's true

3259
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:17,980
You didn't say anything about what you just said

3260
02:02:17,980 --> 02:02:20,300
Greater than that, I also accumulate holy objects

3261
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:22,420
Cumulative to especially as they say

3262
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:27,660
I actually found out that even the muscle mass of polar bears has PCV inside

3263
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:30,220
He has never been to this tropical country for vacation

3264
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:31,860
How come he has PCV on him

3265
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:33,420
Because he is accumulating properties

3266
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:35,740
He goes to Polabella and is called SeaO

3267
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:38,860
SeaO’s seals will accumulate when he eats them

3268
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:41,620
If you want to use that method to push people

3269
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:43,300
Aunt Nabora should be safe

3270
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:43,740
Why

3271
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:45,740
because he's just a consumer

3272
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:47,740
First level consumer is he just eating algae?

3273
02:02:48,220 --> 02:02:49,380
or a service animal

3274
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:52,940
So his accumulation level must be relatively low

3275
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:55,340
but you talk about internal organs i think he's so small

3276
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:58,300
The amount he can accumulate is also quite limited

3277
02:02:58,300 --> 02:03:00,140
But when you eat a lot, don't you?

3278
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
It's your parents and you make him

3279
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
logarithm made him bigger

3280
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
As long as we want to find that Chen Liangyu

3281
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
help us plan it

3282
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
It's really brilliant

3283
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
because of time

3284
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Today we let everyone applaud

3285
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
thanks again

3286
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
This is a very personal and brilliant speech

3287
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
thank you all
