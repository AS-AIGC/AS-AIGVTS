00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
music

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
music

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
music

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
music

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:41,000
music

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
music

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
applause

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
applause

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
come friends

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Then I'm here on behalf of Academia Sinica

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Welcome to our feast of knowledge today

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,000
Our keynote speaker today is

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,800
Chen Yihao, a research fellow of the Institute of Statistical Science of our school

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,000
What about Dr. Chen?

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is a research fellow at our Institute of Statistics

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
National Yang Ming University Institute of Public Health

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the Peace of the Department of Mathematics, National Taiwan Normal University

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and adjunct professor

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Dr. Chen graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University with a bachelor's degree

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Then his experience is a bit special

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He later went to the statistics office of the town university

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
got a master's degree

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Later, I went to National Taiwan University Institute of Public Health

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ph.D.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
We can see this development of it

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,400
How to go from motor to statistics

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,100
Then I went to the guard's side

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,400
with this

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
What did you tell us today?

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
Earthquake risk again

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
so this

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,600
We can see that this statistic

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,200
can contain many, many

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,900
different facets of science

35
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
then he is

36
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,700
in the past served

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,400
Assistant Professor of Mathematics Department of Normal University

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,300
When he was in 2000

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,400
Entered the Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,400
It's been 18 years now

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,100
that he was

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,100
what is his research interest

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
in statistical methodology

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,900
Biostatistics etc.

45
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,300
the nearest research center

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,200
is in survival data analysis

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,300
we can all listen

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,200
Analysis of long-term follow-up data

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,100
Big Data Database Diagnosis

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
and analyze incomplete data analysis

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,920
It sounds like it's all data analysis

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,040
But it is divided into many aspects

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,720
Well, he's done an excellent job of research.

54
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,600
He has won the National Science Council

55
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,280
Mr. Wu Dayu Memorial Award of the current Ministry of Education and Technology

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,640
This is for young researchers

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,960
The teacher spoke very smoothly

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,240
And then when you're a bit more senior

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,080
There's another one called the Distinguished Research Award

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,320
Then Mr. Chen also won this research award.

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,680
Then also won the Research Assistant Award for Young Scholars from the China Security Research Institute

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,960
He also recently supported a deep root project in the courtyard

63
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,120
So his researcher is in our younger generation

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,320
Or when it comes to the tenured generation, it is a very outstanding one

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,160
So today his topic we see here is

66
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,120
Integrative analysis of seismic risk assessment and different databases

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Analysis as an example to tell everyone

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
what statistics do

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The first will talk about two practical examples

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The first example is statistical methods and techniques

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
These introduce some

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
some in statistics

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
those technologies here

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
then will

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Use this more than 7,000 pens for Taiwan earthquake

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Surface Acceleration Data

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Established a model for earthquake risk assessment

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Very useful for earthquake engineers

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So we can see that the statistical

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
tools in discipline

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
how do we use it

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then according to the content and characteristics of the seismic survey data

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How to find these commonalities

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Error and Uncertainty of Velocity Data

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course, what we want most is to be able to accurately predict

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
These

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,540
These surface accelerations and the risk of earthquakes

88
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,000
can make a good assessment

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
so where should i live

90
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Or maybe we can listen to it today

91
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,500
Can you tell which places in Taiwan are safer?

92
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,800
Then the second example is to use introductory statistics

93
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,000
How can we, in our current era of so-called big data

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,500
Can be combined with many of the increasingly popular

95
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
There are also a large number of electronic databases

96
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,100
So from these databases you can

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,900
Long and short

98
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,700
Then we need to sort out accurate and useful information

99
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,900
So this is the second question

100
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,200
Integrated analysis of different databases

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,700
So now we have a lot of databases in Taiwan

102
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
We have a database of health insurance

103
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,200
and the National Health Interview Survey database

104
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,100
Just use this as an example

105
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Then use the large amount of statistical probability above

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,220
So to explore the relationship between some diseases

107
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,160
For example, in medicine, there is a difference between a banded foam pillow and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

108
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
There is still some connection

109
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,840
So this is why I said that even if it is not a scientist in medicine

110
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Then we start from this seemingly abstract and somewhat cold statistics

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,560
But we thought we could make some connections

112
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,000
So today we are very happy to have our speaker Chen Yihao

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,120
Researchers come to tell us what statistics are doing

114
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,000
Now please welcome our keynote speaker today with warm applause

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,560
Well, thank you very much for the invitation and introduction from the head of the seat

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,560
Thank you very much for participating in our variety show

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is the experience activity of each college

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Everyone has a day's work

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
or a day of class

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then stay here at night

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you all

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Vice President Zhou just introduced

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let me introduce to you very clearly what I want to talk about today.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's because I, as a

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
statistics this

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In this study of statistics

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I also

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Experienced

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
If you start counting from the doctoral dissertation

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's been more than 20 years

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
so i think

134
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
if i want to be here today

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Just enjoy what to say

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I can probably only say

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
topic like this

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
just to let everyone know

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In the end statistics

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
These read statistics

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
what the hell are they doing

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
because doing may have

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
many must

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,340
It is not common for people who have the opportunity to come into contact with statistics

145
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,020
The background of this picture is the Statistics Institute of Academia Sinica

146
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,060
is where I work

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,180
In fact, it is directly opposite the Academic Activity Center

148
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,700
past this lawn

149
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,320
So if you are free, you are welcome to do it.

150
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,860
good

151
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,140
That

152
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,820
So at the beginning, I will briefly introduce some background of statistics.

153
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,840
That

154
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,680
The English of statistics is this statistics

155
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,840
That word actually evolved from the word state.

156
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,660
that state we know its

157
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,740
it means country

158
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,500
so

159
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,080
Indeed, statistics

160
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,640
Its main job is to

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
the government or ruler of a country

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
In order to understand some of the current situation in his country

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
For example, the population

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
then this

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How much is this income?

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How many agricultural products are there?

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How many cows and how many sheep?

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
hope to have these numbers

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
what about the government

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hope to have these numbers

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So what about statistics at that time?

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
is doing something like this

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So it’s actually equivalent to what we’re talking about today.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
government statistics

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
just like us today

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
like us in taiwan

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Government agency host office

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The Statistics Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Health and Welfare

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
what they are doing

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
is very similar to

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What about the statistics at that time?

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because the data at that time

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Mainly probably because at the time

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The amount of data at that time was not as large and complex as it is today

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So in fact, the data at that time were mainly obtained through censuses.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That is, the entire country has been investigated

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So the main work of statistics at this time

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
In fact, it is to do the so-called data summary

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It is the work of summarizing the data

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's like when we were young, we were in elementary or middle school

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
A little basic statistics we learned

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We are doing this so-called data summary, right?

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
For example, we might count

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's be honest and ask us to calculate an average of some data

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Calculate the median of some data

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,460
the standard deviation of the data

197
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,600
then this is

198
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,360
The so-called Data Summary

199
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,940
Summary's Testase

200
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,040
is to put the original many numbers

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,160
many numbers

202
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,400
we may not have time to see it

203
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,740
Or don't want to see it at all

204
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,960
but we put it

205
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,300
only minus

206
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Digest it into a few important numbers

207
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,360
Through these simple numbers

208
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,260
we can understand this

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,960
thousands of data

210
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,460
general picture

211
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,500
we can understand it inside

212
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,460
contains the message

213
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,160
good

214
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,300
So actually

215
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,460
what about this thing

216
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,700
maybe look say

217
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
This is before the 19th century

218
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
maybe

219
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,400
Um

220
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,960
very traditional

221
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,460
or very

222
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,800
maybe very boring

223
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,760
like when we were kids

224
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,860
Although the average

225
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,060
it's just a process

226
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
but behind it

227
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,000
actually

228
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,900
There is also a very important statistical theory

229
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,860
that is

230
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,860
it rises

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,460
Adequacy of our statistical theory

232
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,100
That is to say, how do you use a few simple

233
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,200
very few numbers

234
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,560
will be able to grasp thousands of

235
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Especially when it comes to big data

236
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,400
so much data

237
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,600
when you have no way to see it

238
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,560
Through a few data

239
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
to be able to summarize the key points

240
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,760
information in it

241
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,800
That thing is actually

242
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
In our statistical theory

243
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
very important so-called sufficiency

244
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,360
sufficient statistics

245
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,000
sufficient statistic

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
such a concept

247
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,900
then next

248
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,700
after the 19th century

249
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,500
Statistics began to develop differently

250
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,700
We call it modern statistic

251
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,600
at this time

252
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,960
mainly depends on

253
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,960
At this time, the incentives developed by Bloomberg

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,240
Probability. We learned a little about probability when we were kids, right?

255
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,520
There is a little chance of losing Size

256
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,080
One in six is ​​a probability, right?

257
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
That

258
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,320
Because of the tools of probability

259
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,960
Then our Institute of Statistics and Probability

260
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,920
What about some tools developed?

261
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,720
At this time, the focus of statistics

262
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,840
The point is never just what I just said

263
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,200
census data

264
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,280
What about the data we care about now?

265
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,040
also includes the so-called

266
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,840
Sampling

267
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,480
right

268
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,440
The data obtained by sampling

269
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,520
Then use probability

270
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,560
What about some tools developed in probability theory?

271
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,440
What about statistics?

272
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,760
Can these tools be used to deal with it?

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,440
Because of the randomness in the sampled data

274
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,000
randomness

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,440
I think you can imagine that

276
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,040
today if we were to

277
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
For example, this one at our site

278
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Among the audience friends

279
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,660
Draw these 10 people out

280
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,040
Of course, there is a lot of randomness in this

281
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
great uncertainty

282
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
maybe these people

283
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
maybe those people will be selected

284
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,840
so

285
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,340
This is what is meant by randomness

286
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,880
how to deal with this

287
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,680
randomness

288
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,340
How to deal with this kind of randomness and uncertainty

289
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,040
find a pattern

290
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
then this is the time

291
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,840
A focus of statistics

292
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
The tools used are mainly

293
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,680
tools of probability

294
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,880
So this time statistics

295
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,480
its main job

296
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,980
Besides what I just said

297
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,180
What about data summary

298
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,180
What about finding the so-called sufficient statistics?

299
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,220
In addition

300
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,920
There is still one

301
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,200
The point is what we call statistical inference

302
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,600
statistical inference

303
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,700
Okay, statistical inference, what does statistical inference mean?

304
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,200
That is, because our current data

305
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,900
Probably only a small part of the whole group

306
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,400
Like we poll, right? We sample

307
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Objects of these visits sampled by this call

308
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,200
Just a small part of the whole group

309
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,800
But we want to take advantage of this sampled fraction

310
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,500
you can speculate, deduce the whole group's

311
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,200
a phenomenon a result

312
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
so this is

313
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,100
This so-called modern statistics

314
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,600
an important thing to do

315
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,700
The work of so-called statistical inference

316
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:56,200
So the purpose is to get out of the sampled samples

317
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,200
guess the larger group behind us

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The situation of classification or the real situation behind it

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
So here are two simple examples

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's what I think, everyone may be better than everyone

321
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Expose to examples of statistics that are commonly heard

322
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Well, this is actually what we call Modern statistics

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Now very widely used

324
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
One example of this is this poll

325
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Or an example of what we call statistically confidence intervals

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That passage is actually from this

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
directly on a medium

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Just copied it down, directly copied it up

329
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Then this survey is commissioned by a certain organization to a certain polling company

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
From March 12th to 15th, 2018

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
For the north and the north and the region

332
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Adults over the age of 64 who fly business jets

333
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,600
A survey of coal-fired power plants was successfully visited

334
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,600
1079 people are below 95% confidence level

335
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,000
The sampling error is 2.98 percentage points for the government

336
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,200
I think everyone sees this

337
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,600
When seeing such a text

338
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
or when you hear something like this

339
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,000
should feel familiar

340
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,600
right

341
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,400
Because it seems that we can often hear

342
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,000
The results of such polls

343
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,800
that is to say

344
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,200
Why is there this sampling error

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,600
This government 2.98 percent

346
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,400
This number comes out like this

347
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,600
Why is there a 95% confidence level?

348
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,000
Such numbers come out

349
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,800
In fact, this reflects

350
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,200
Our current statistics

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Not just to understand this 1079-bit sampling sample

352
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,000
It's just the result

353
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,900
In fact, we are more important from these 1079 bits

354
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,000
In this sampled sample

355
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,000
To estimate in the end Jeonbuk

356
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,200
adults in their area

357
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,500
Their opinions on this public housing and coal-fired power plant

358
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
how is it

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Because you have to infer a

360
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,000
a large group

361
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's like you're trying to understand the whole iceberg from the tip

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,500
So there will be a little error in this

363
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
We have to allow a little error

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So there will be this sampling error

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
2.98 percentage points

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Such numbers run out

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
that is to say

368
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I would like to ask those present

369
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
Dear friends here

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,080
That is, have you noticed this?

371
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:14,080
The number 1079 and the two numbers 2.98%

372
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,400
Have you found any connection between them?

373
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,280
can we be this

374
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,320
I don't know if there are comments

375
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
That is to say, can this

376
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,120
Give it a shot, but there are statisticians here.

377
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,720
here are

378
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,040
A better statistician than me is sitting here

379
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
so you can't fight

380
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:46,040
Have you found out whether this 1079 has anything to do with this 2.98%

381
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
sorry

382
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,120
3% error

383
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,920
But this 3% or 2.98% is different from 10

384
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
79 What's the matter?

385
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
There is still a mathematical relationship

386
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,200
right

387
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,400
right

388
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,900
yes it's his

389
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,700
It's him

390
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,200
But he has a definite mathematical formula

391
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,300
right

392
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,100
1079 how to get 2.98%

393
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,300
right

394
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,400
Do you have a quicker mental calculation?

395
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,400
that is

396
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,000
Find out how this 2.98 came from

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
Where did this error come from?

398
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,200
Even better, this Vice President Zhou is too smart

399
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,900
It is indeed better

400
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,800
It's better to drive and then count down

401
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,500
that is

402
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,600
3.4 Yes because there is another 20% off

403
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,900
We have to multiply by 0.98 but usually that 0.98 we just

404
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,300
don't care

405
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,500
So it's almost

406
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,520
root sign open root sign

407
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,960
that's what we call statistics

408
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,080
A word we statisticians say most often

409
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,960
is the square root n

410
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,880
The root sign n is the number of samples

411
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,200
So the square root n is in our statistics

412
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,840
is a magic number

413
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,440
root sign n so everyone today

414
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,520
you will know

415
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,360
what statisticians do

416
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,000
In fact, it is very simple, it is the root number n

417
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,040
so later you see this

418
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,040
When the news is broadcasting the results of this poll again

419
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,560
When this reporter is still talking

420
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,640
When successfully interviewing 1079 people

421
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,680
you can figure it out right away

422
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,440
Incorrect sampling is a percentage point sent by the government

423
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,200
then your child your friend

424
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,760
must adore you

425
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,040
Then the second example is

426
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,840
p-value I want to do it again

427
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,920
If there is this to engage in scientific research

428
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
especially this biomedical

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
or social science

430
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
of this research

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Probably very familiar with P-value

432
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Because I have to follow this P-value all day long

433
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
deal, right?

434
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
because we basically

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
we do an experiment

436
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
we want to see this experiment

437
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Is it the result of the experiment

438
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is it enough to support

439
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Results of our experiments

440
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
it is indeed a

441
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
a significant result

442
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
when shrinking

443
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Then P-value

444
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Its size basically reflects the

445
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Such experimental data

446
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
it supports

447
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Experimental results

448
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
did not have this

449
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
full of this salience

450
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
such a contraction

451
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
so

452
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If the number of this P-value is larger

453
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If the number of p value is larger

454
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
For example like this 0.452

455
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
p value must be connected between 0 and 1

456
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So if the number of p value is larger

457
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It means that the degree of your support is not significant is higher

458
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So your result is not significant

459
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
your result is not significant

460
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Conversely, if this value is smaller

461
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
means you support your data

462
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The results of your experiment support this conclusion significantly

463
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
is insignificant the less the extent to which such hypotheses

464
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The smaller the degree of insignificance

465
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
that represents your result

466
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The degree of significance is higher

467
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
So we generally do scientific research

468
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
is to hope that our p value

469
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
is the smaller the better

470
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Because this means that our experimental results are more significant

471
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,300
So this is also an example

472
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,860
That is to say, this modern statistical

473
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,000
is what we call an inferential statistic

474
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,200
is a statistical inference

475
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Because like P-Failure

476
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,300
He just wants to learn from the samples you experimented with

477
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,900
to infer the results of real science

478
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,500
Is it of sufficient significance

479
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,000
good

480
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So basically we can say

481
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,700
this statistic

482
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,300
statistics is special

483
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,700
Although it is a

484
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,100
so to speak from mathematics

485
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,700
A discipline developed from applied mathematics

486
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,800
But it is different from traditional mathematics

487
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Traditional Applied Mathematics

488
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
there is a very different place

489
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,000
just to say

490
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,100
traditional mathematics

491
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,400
more focus on the natural world

492
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,700
a very definite rule

493
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,400
good

494
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,500
That

495
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,000
it's theirs

496
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
research object, such as Einstein's

497
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,840
1st class Mc squared or Newton's

498
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,000
The constant rate of Newton's motion F and other MA these things

499
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,800
These are a very definite, very definite

500
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
a law of nature

501
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,720
That's what statisticians focus on

502
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,640
is dealing with

503
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,160
We are everywhere in our daily life

504
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,640
This so-called uncertainty

505
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,520
One of the founding fathers of this America

506
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,640
Franklin once said

507
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,360
There are only two things that are certain in life

508
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,120
everything else is uncertain

509
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,480
Do you know what those two things are?

510
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,320
Death and taxes, right?

511
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,200
It's May 1st and we have to pay taxes again, right?

512
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,280
So only death and paying taxes are two things

513
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Everything else is uncertain

514
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Then we statisticians are actually

515
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
with these main

516
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The problems to be dealt with are these

517
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
with uncertainty

518
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
related questions

519
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The so-called statistical model

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Its point is to go

521
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
going to portray

522
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
and to assess the magnitude of this uncertainty

523
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Then the so-called statistical inference

524
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
is to exist in uncertainty

525
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
make statistical inferences in the current situation

526
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
go from the tip of the iceberg

527
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
infer the truth

528
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So in the statistical chart

529
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
we often see

530
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
not just one result

531
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Instead there will be a

532
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
a degree of change up and down

533
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
represents the uncertainty

534
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
this error this possibility

535
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,780
Another number term in our statistics is called

536
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,000
Mutations

537
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,240
variation

538
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,240
variation跟certity

539
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,600
It is the same as arrow to some extent

540
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,600
good

541
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,160
That

542
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,000
Statisticians are mainly

543
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,440
Statistics is mainly to

544
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
go

545
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,280
To make statistical inferences amidst these uncertainties

546
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,800
then making statistical inferences

547
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,720
What we pay more attention to is actually not the final result.

548
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,320
This result may be anyone can get one

549
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,520
some kind of result, right?

550
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,240
But what?

551
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,640
What about statistics?

552
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,600
It pays more attention to the process of getting this result

553
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,920
this process

554
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,840
That is, we would like to say that the process is a

555
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,040
best way

556
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,640
The best

557
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,400
A sort of

558
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,960
ar

559
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
program to get the result of this inference

560
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So the so-called

561
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This is what we call this statistical inference

562
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This optimality in statistical inference

563
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Optimality

564
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Optimality

565
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's a matter of great importance in statistics.

566
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
matter of great importance

567
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So when we use statistics to make inferences,

568
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
There must be a so-called objective function

569
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Our objective function

570
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Usually a so-called likely-who direction

571
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
likely-who is a possibility

572
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
likelihood function

573
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
This likelihood refers to a statistical model

574
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
which produces the data we observe

575
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
such a possibility

576
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
such a likely-who

577
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So this direction we call the likely-who direction

578
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
so a good model

579
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It should make this like-if

580
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
how about the direction

581
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The bigger the better, right?

582
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because it means that this model

583
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
is more likely to produce

584
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Is the data we see right now?

585
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So that means

586
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
This model follows us

587
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The data actually seen is the best fit

588
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
right? that's what it means

589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
so our

590
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
we will have so-called

591
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
maximum likelihood

592
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
method of such inference

593
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
In fact, in some cases

594
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
would also be equivalent to

595
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
more often heard

596
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
The so-called minimum frequency method

597
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
minimum frequency method

598
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
well then

599
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
In addition, our so-called

600
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
optimality

601
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
our best

602
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
also includes the so-called consistency

603
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
consistency

604
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
another way of saying it

605
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
law of large numbers

606
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You may hear this name more often.

607
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
law of large numbers

608
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Law of large numbers

609
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Then his statistical comparison

610
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
the professional term

611
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
called consistency

612
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
consistency

613
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
what he meant was basically

614
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We want the outcome of our statistical inference

615
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
With the number of samples

616
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
when getting bigger

617
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
He was able to get closer and closer to the real result

618
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
this is called consistency

619
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
consistency

620
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
on the other hand

621
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
we also hope

622
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
In addition to this consistency

623
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
we also hope

624
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The results of our statistical inferences

625
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
effective

626
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Efficiency

627
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Efficiency

628
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
that means

629
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
we hope

630
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
because of sampling

631
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
different sampling

632
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
have caused changes

633
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
because just now

634
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,400
These data and data are all sampled.

635
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,600
So different sampling will lead to different results

636
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,400
right

637
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,600
We expect such different outcome variations

638
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,600
The smaller the impact on the outcome, the better

639
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,800
The smaller the better

640
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,600
This variation with sampling

641
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
What about the change in the result?

642
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,600
What about the smaller

643
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,400
We say that its efficiency is higher

644
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,000
the more efficient it is the better

645
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What about statistical theory?

646
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,800
In fact, it also gives

647
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,500
In fact, we are in the general problem

648
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
If we want to make statistical inferences

649
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,200
In fact, we have a best standard

650
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,500
That is the so-called information bound

651
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,000
This means our efficiency

652
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,500
best possible

653
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,300
highest efficiency

654
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,400
That is, the minimum degree of change

655
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,000
With the change of sampling

656
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
minimum degree of change

657
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
good so

658
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Such an Information Bound

659
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
just told us one like a

660
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
test tell you

661
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What is the full score of this test

662
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
so you have a goal

663
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
You can move towards that goal

664
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If you still can't reach that goal

665
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You can also know that

666
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
How much room do you have to work hard

667
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Then this Efficiency

668
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
This Information Bound

669
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
involved a

670
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
defined by our statistics

671
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Information

672
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Everyone is saying this word every day

673
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Information Information message, right?

674
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Then how do we define statistics

675
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
How much information is there in the so-called data

676
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Information basically

677
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
we are based on

678
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
This Objective Function just mentioned

679
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
this objective function

680
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
its this

681
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
degree of bending

682
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That is the so-called curvature Curvature

683
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
to define

684
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Then let me ask you again

685
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
that is

686
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Suppose our current goal

687
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
is the maximum required for this objective function

688
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
This is the goal of our inference

689
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Then I want to ask everyone

690
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
that is

691
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The red curve on the left

692
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
with this blue curve on the right

693
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
which curve do you think

694
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Will give you more information

695
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Your goal is to ask for the maximum value

696
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
What do you think is the red curve

697
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
still blue curve

698
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Will give you more information

699
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Why is it red on the left?

700
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
the aunt

701
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
right

702
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
can you tell me

703
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,320
perfectly accurate

704
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,920
exactly that's it

705
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Because of its large difference

706
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,320
so you can easily find

707
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,440
where is the best place

708
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,120
right

709
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,040
that blue curve

710
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,280
you will be more difficult

711
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
because it feels the same

712
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,720
you can hardly find the best

713
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,840
right

714
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,320
so what

715
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,840
The information of our statistics

716
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,040
is through the curvature of our target content

717
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,480
Then we start from this elementary

718
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,640
we also know

719
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,560
In fact, the curvature of a curve

720
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,960
In fact, you can directly use this curve

721
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,760
Secondary differentiation gives

722
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
right

723
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,000
So this is how we

724
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,680
To measure the information in this data

725
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,800
So this information

726
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,200
not just talk

727
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,080
In fact, our statistics have a clear way

728
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,920
To measure this information

729
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
In addition we have the so-called

730
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
near normality

731
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It is also well-known in our statistics

732
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
central limit theorem

733
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
This is mainly to describe

734
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Sampling

735
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
When sampling is changing

736
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
How the results of our statistical inferences change

737
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
we want to say it will change

738
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But its change must have a law

739
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
what's the rule

740
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
There will be such a law as the normal distribution

741
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
so that we can have a

742
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
very convenient way to measure

743
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
to calculate the uncertainty

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Uncertainty due to sampling

745
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So here is an example

746
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Like this is the law of large numbers

747
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Everyone may have seen this

748
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
That is to say, this S8 is the average of our sample

749
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The one below 41 445

750
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
4,6,7,18 This is its sample number

751
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,200
What about when you increase the number of samples

752
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,900
You will find that this S8 slowly and slowly

753
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,100
close to a number

754
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,400
In fact, it is close to 0.5, which is the one in our picture.

755
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,200
red line

756
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,500
Then this 0.5 is indeed

757
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,700
average for this group

758
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,700
So this picture is to tell you

759
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,400
a thing called the law of large numbers

760
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,400
We just talked about this statistical inference

761
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,600
What about this statistic?

762
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,600
will gradually increase with the number of samples

763
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,200
close to the mean of our true population

764
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Like that poll, right?

765
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,700
When you poll if you interview more and more people

766
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,100
Why

767
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,500
The result of this visit is getting closer to

768
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:00,200
The support of the people in this truly all northern and northern accumulation areas

769
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
how many

770
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
so

771
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,460
This is called the law of large numbers

772
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,940
What about the other thing? This is the central limit theorem just mentioned.

773
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,780
normality of eating

774
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,080
This is just the average

775
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,080
it's always changing, right?

776
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,680
But we record all the process of its changes

777
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,040
and then put all occurrences of

778
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,680
only into one

779
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,380
The so-called fat map, the fat map we learned as children

780
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,000
right

781
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Just look at its distribution

782
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,840
Distribution from large to small

783
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,200
that's what i just said

784
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,960
that is

785
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Although it will keep moving

786
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:37,960
right

787
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,640
but you will find

788
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,560
this

789
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,160
Well

790
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,760
What is the law of its change?

791
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,000
actually it

792
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,560
Although big and small, right?

793
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,000
but you can find

794
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,500
When you fatten all of it from big to small into one

795
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,800
When the fat map is presented

796
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
It is very close to a normal distribution

797
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
What is a normal distribution

798
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
It's the blue line behind

799
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,100
blue line

800
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,200
Then the width of this normal distribution

801
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,300
reflect the extent to which we have changed

802
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,100
right

803
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,300
reflect the extent to which we have changed

804
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,800
What about the width?

805
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,000
Basically what Vice President Zhou just said

806
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,500
One part of the root of n

807
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
such a width

808
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,800
So the width is just in the process of changing

809
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,000
everyone can see

810
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,800
Because the square root sign is n/1

811
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,900
So when n gets bigger and bigger

812
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,000
Its width is getting smaller and smaller

813
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,800
So the extent of our change is getting smaller and smaller

814
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,100
getting smaller

815
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,400
So we get more and more accurate results

816
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,100
And this level of precision

817
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,600
It is possible to use a very simple normal distribution

818
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,600
to characterize it to measure it

819
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,400
good

820
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,000
Then here I am simple

821
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,760
When Zhou Fuyuechang was mentioned in the introduction at the beginning, it means

822
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,760
In fact, statistics is a

823
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,500
A knowledge that can be applied in a variety of different fields

824
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,420
In fact, it is also an instrumental science

825
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,720
Just like a computer, like information

826
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,840
it is used as a tool

827
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,800
can be used for a variety of problems

828
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,420
good

829
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,220
So actually I thought about it myself and said

830
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,120
Statistics for the entire scientific community

831
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,320
What major contributions have you made?

832
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Then I list these three

833
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,520
But what I want to tell you is to say

834
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,820
This is only limited to my personal

835
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,420
because of my own field of study

836
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,420
So I know these three

837
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,120
Of course other statisticians

838
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,420
may have different answers

839
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,200
But I don't think these three are the only three

840
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,360
what i just said

841
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,000
But they do, I think, very important contributions

842
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,000
The first is the so-called case control study

843
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,240
case control study

844
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,520
The second is the so-called EM algorithm

845
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,720
The third is the so-called Kephenmeyer curve

846
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,560
So let me introduce to you

847
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,800
The first I think is a very big contribution

848
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,800
It is a case control study

849
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,160
case control study is called case control study in Chinese

850
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,560
This is now widely used in public health

851
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,520
in medicine in public health

852
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,040
A research method in the field of epidemiology

853
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,680
This method does something like this

854
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,400
That is to say, suppose you want to study Western Tobacco

855
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,320
Will it be easy to get scrapped

856
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The traditional approach may be that you have to watch a group of

857
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Following a group of CN people

858
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Then look at the proportion of them getting lung cancer 5 years later and 10 years later

859
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
right

860
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Then watch a bunch of this

861
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
People who are not CN, right?

862
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Same tracking for 5 years and 10 years

863
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Then look at his rate of getting lung cancer

864
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Then do a comparison, right?

865
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This way you can draw a conclusion saying

866
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Is there any relationship between CN and lung cancer?

867
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
What about proportional control studies?

868
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
he did this

869
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
he didn't do that

870
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
because doing so

871
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
you spend a lot of time

872
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
you're going to track down

873
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's what the proportional control study did

874
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
That is to say, he went directly to the hospital

875
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Just go to the oncology department, for example, right?

876
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He went to find a patient with lung cancer, right?

877
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Then, for example, he goes to the Chiayi Division again, right?

878
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Family medicine, he went to the guy who didn't have lung cancer.

879
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,540
patients without lung cancer

880
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,740
But he's probably just here to add one for a health check

881
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,840
Or watch a diarrhea or catch a cold

882
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,500
so he doesn't have lung cancer

883
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,340
So you go directly to these two groups of people

884
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,240
and ask them if they smoke

885
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,000
Then you directly compare

886
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,740
So such a

887
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,900
The research method is called

888
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,500
case-control study

889
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,500
Then this method is from

890
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Early 20th century around 1910s and 1920s

891
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,840
Began to appear in medical professional journals

892
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,440
Such studies are beginning to be reported

893
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,040
The main research object at that time was

894
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,040
The relationship between smoking and lung cancer

895
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,800
And this birth history

896
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,900
women's reproductive history

897
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,100
has he ever had a child

898
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,540
how many children were born

899
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,040
At what age did he have his first child

900
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,080
in connection with his subsequent breast cancer

901
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,680
So at the beginning of the 20th century, this kind of

902
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,880
Case Control study of this kind of research is reported

903
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,040
At that time, at that time, it caused a great deal of

904
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,680
caused a lot of controversy in the scientific community

905
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,720
why

906
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,800
Because it should be easy for everyone to see

907
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,680
That is to say, traditionally we statistically analyze

908
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,000
so-called representative sample

909
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,200
right? for example

910
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,160
We often say that you are clearly inaccurate in the investigation

911
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,400
Because your sample is not representative

912
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,560
right

913
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,840
So what about our statistical analysis?

914
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,560
What is often required is

915
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,040
Our premise is to have a

916
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,800
representative的sample

917
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,000
a representative sample

918
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,440
The sample obtained from the Case Control study

919
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,480
Obviously not a representative sample

920
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,000
right

921
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,960
For example, if I take 100 today

922
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
100 lung cancer patients

923
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
With 100 patients without lung cancer

924
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
What about this?

925
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
inside my sample

926
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
The rate of lung cancer is 50%

927
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
right

928
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But in all Taiwan

929
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
of all groups

930
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
rate of lung cancer

931
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
is far less than this 50%

932
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
right

933
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
So this sample

934
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
obviously not a

935
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
representative sample

936
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So how can he be used to infer

937
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
What is the relationship between smoking and lung cancer?

938
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
or

939
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Women's reproductive history with him

940
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
What about breast cancer?

941
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
so this time

942
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
caused a very, very big debate

943
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
So until this about the 1950s

944
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
This is it

945
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The statistician Jeromey Kohnfield

946
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
he is this american

947
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
National Cancer Institute

948
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
National Cancer Institute

949
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
a statistician of

950
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
He is theoretically

951
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
from mathematics to statistics

952
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
In theory to confirm this case control study

953
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The results of his analysis

954
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
his effectiveness

955
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
his correctness

956
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
With you just now you followed the smoker directly

957
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
track non-smokers

958
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Then look at the results of his last illness

959
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This correctness is exactly the same as

960
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
He clarified the fact that

961
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
then after him

962
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
There are more and more statisticians

963
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
to further develop

964
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
to refine this sort of case-control study

965
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So some research methods like this

966
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
also facilitated this

967
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Many studies on this etiology

968
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
research on disease prevention

969
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
in medicine

970
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
so like this guy

971
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
This man is actually an epidemic

972
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,400
Pathologist, he said in his book

973
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,680
say it

974
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,620
List of sophisticated use and understanding of case control

975
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,680
studies is the most outstanding

976
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,400
mestarch development of modern

977
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,320
epidemiology

978
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,240
So he said it himself

979
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,360
modern epidemiology

980
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,080
The word is epidemiology

981
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,800
Epidemiology in modern times

982
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,040
One of the most outstanding achievements is the

983
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,000
The use and understanding of case-control research methods

984
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,760
behind this

985
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
In fact, the biggest contribution is the contribution of statisticians

986
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,560
Because it's up to the statisticians to figure it out.

987
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,360
this

988
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,280
case control study his validity his correctness

989
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,520
and further refine his method

990
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,560
Okay, the second important contribution I want to make is

991
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,120
Statistically important contributions to the scientific community

992
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,080
is the so-called

993
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,840
hospital algorithm

994
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,840
hospital algorithm

995
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,040
So

996
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:09,080
The hospital algorithm has actually been

997
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,240
used in many, many different fields

998
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,120
like

999
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,760
Like this Machine Learning

1000
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,560
very red now

1001
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,000
active learning

1002
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,360
or like medical imaging

1003
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,600
or something like this

1004
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,120
Psychological Dosimetry

1005
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,800
volume psychology

1006
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,960
fake finance

1007
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,280
Financial Engineering

1008
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,840
this kind of

1009
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,040
different fields

1010
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,160
will use this algorithm

1011
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,400
to calculate

1012
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,360
the result they want

1013
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,400
What about this method?

1014
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,160
In fact, it was first created by three

1015
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,960
The Harvard Statistics Department

1016
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,600
proposed by the professor

1017
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,440
about 40 years ago

1018
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,280
proposed an algorithm

1019
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,560
What about this algorithm?

1020
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,440
that is

1021
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,040
It basically takes our Model

1022
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
divided into observed parts

1023
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
with the unobserved part

1024
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
hidden part

1025
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
and parameters

1026
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Then what about the so-called unobserved

1027
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
1 here is a 1

1028
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
1 what about this thing

1029
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
means to mean

1030
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
You just put the part that you didn't observe

1031
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
you take his average

1032
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
take one of his expectations

1033
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
because he can't see

1034
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So you use his expectations to

1035
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
bring it in

1036
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
fill it in

1037
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
What about the expected value?

1038
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
of course it is

1039
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
conditional expected value

1040
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It is given in the part we have seen

1041
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
and the current parameter value

1042
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
calculated by a

1043
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
expected expectations

1044
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
OK, after I bring you in

1045
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
you can like this

1046
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You see everything you see, right?

1047
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,620
So you can directly address the goal just mentioned

1048
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,620
Contain numbers to maximize

1049
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,460
Do you want to optimize

1050
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,660
to get a parameter value

1051
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,120
After getting the new parameter value

1052
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,920
You go to update the original expectation

1053
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,660
Because this expected value will be related to the parameter value

1054
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,220
Go to update and then do the maximum

1055
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,500
So this algorithm is an iterative process

1056
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,600
it ends up with this

1057
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,960
converge to a final result

1058
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,960
So one is called E step and the other is called M step

1059
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,320
E is to calculate an average, to calculate an expected value

1060
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,800
M is to seek the optimization of the target content

1061
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,200
So the combination of E and M is the EM algorithm

1062
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,200
So what is the benefit of this algorithm?

1063
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,300
The first one is very general

1064
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,220
It can be used for a variety of different problems

1065
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,920
that is

1066
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,780
You don't need for a different problem

1067
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,340
to design a different algorithm

1068
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,880
In fact, later found

1069
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,220
Many, many different algorithms that people are already using

1070
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,840
can be put into the framework of this EM algorithm.

1071
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,680
So you just need to master this basic principle

1072
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,380
It is the two steps of E and M

1073
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,380
you will

1074
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,140
You can calculate many, many problems

1075
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,040
So this is a very big contribution

1076
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,640
Another great contribution is that

1077
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,160
This EM algorithm is a very stable algorithm

1078
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,240
That is to say, every time it is carried out

1079
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:42,040
will catch your target

1080
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:45,080
in further optimization

1081
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,280
further bigger

1082
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,440
or better

1083
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,480
so

1084
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,280
It means you're always going in the right direction

1085
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,200
you won't go wrong

1086
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,200
you are always going

1087
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,360
one of the best places to go

1088
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,720
So this is the EM algorithm

1089
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,040
The third example I'm going to talk about is this

1090
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,160
The so-called Kippelmeyer Curve

1091
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,840
This is two peoples

1092
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,040
two peoples

1093
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,680
two peoples two statisticians

1094
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,880
What does this curve do?

1095
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,440
it is going to be estimated

1096
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,760
This kind of curve actually I think

1097
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,160
doing if there is this

1098
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,840
is a biomedical background

1099
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,720
especially the words of the researchers

1100
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,440
may be very familiar

1101
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,520
especially doctors

1102
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,880
you may very well be in

1103
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,360
See such graphics on medical journals

1104
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,600
what is this

1105
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,960
this is one

1106
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,760
This is a group of patients

1107
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,200
you have to estimate it

1108
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,680
survival curve

1109
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,400
survival rate

1110
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,800
So what about the Y axis?

1111
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,040
represents the survival rate

1112
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Survival rate, so you can see it's 1 at the beginning, right?

1113
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
In the beginning, everyone survived

1114
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Then gradually as time goes on

1115
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Over time it will, the survival rate will

1116
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
when you have someone gradually passing away

1117
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Your survival rate will keep dropping

1118
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
So what is this district line like?

1119
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It is to tell you that this group of patients their

1120
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,000
A situation in which survival rates decrease over time

1121
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So doctors often have such zone lines

1122
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Let's see, for example, the five-year survival rate for cancer

1123
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
data like this is very important to them

1124
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
A tool that this survival zone line

1125
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
In fact, it is not simple at all

1126
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
so we have to

1127
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,320
But the so-called survival rate means

1128
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,600
For example, he just said this picture

1129
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,600
What are the chances that he just lived past 10 months?

1130
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,920
then you go and see

1131
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,960
His chances of this his time over 10 months

1132
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,520
You even count, right?

1133
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,800
But the reality is not so simple

1134
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:20,800
because

1135
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,000
if you think about it

1136
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,360
if you today

1137
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,400
what you want to see today is

1138
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,400
50 month survival rate

1139
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,200
50 month survival rate

1140
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,600
that may be a lot of people

1141
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,600
that is

1142
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
That is to say, 50 months is about a few years

1143
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,600
4 years right?

1144
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
4 years

1145
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,600
and you

1146
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,320
You are going to record this result today

1147
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,400
Maybe you're doing a clinical study

1148
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,720
right

1149
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,000
But what?

1150
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,880
Although you said you want

1151
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,280
you want to get a 50

1152
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
50 months is a survival rate of over 4 years, right?

1153
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
But maybe you can't wait that long

1154
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
you can't wait that long

1155
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That means you may have to within 3 years

1156
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You will have a statistical result

1157
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
so it becomes

1158
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
some people if he

1159
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
when he was 3 years old

1160
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
he is alive

1161
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
You can't see the real age of death of these people

1162
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
because you can't

1163
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Because some people he will survive longer

1164
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
But your observation time is limited

1165
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
is limited

1166
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
you can't help

1167
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Everyone tracked down his real death

1168
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So this would result in

1169
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Some complexity of our data

1170
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,520
you're at the end of three years

1171
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,960
so all you know is to say

1172
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,460
he lived for three years

1173
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:06,920
but you have no way of knowing

1174
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,400
how long did he really survive

1175
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,060
because after three years

1176
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,520
You no longer observe this patient

1177
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,120
Follow up with this patient again

1178
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,320
What about the other side?

1179
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,760
There are some other possibilities

1180
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,000
Maybe it's not a matter of you not having enough time to observe

1181
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Maybe even this patient

1182
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,060
He may have been transferred midway.

1183
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,460
or he moved

1184
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,920
you will never find him

1185
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,060
So maybe at twenty months he

1186
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,320
he is alive and well

1187
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,960
But he moved next

1188
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,580
you won't be able to contact him

1189
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,960
So what about this kind of person?

1190
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,120
also cause

1191
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,920
This complexity in our data

1192
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,880
We are going to do this kind of data

1193
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,520
We call it Sensor Data

1194
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,560
Sensor Data

1195
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,780
So how about this kind of Sensor Data

1196
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,220
in the presence of

1197
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:00,080
to get a correct

1198
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,580
survival curve survival curve

1199
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,940
What about this estimate?

1200
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,580
Inference?

1201
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,280
this is a

1202
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,980
It's actually not a simple question

1203
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,780
That is also through Kepham and Meyer

1204
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:17,480
Where are the two statisticians?

1205
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,520
They discovered the method

1206
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,220
So we'll call it now

1207
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:24,320
Kepham-Meyer Curve

1208
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,220
Or called Proud-Limit Curve

1209
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,260
So what about the doctor now?

1210
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,020
Although he may only be able to observe

1211
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,720
one short year short three years

1212
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,720
Or that although his patients may

1213
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,600
some will be lost in the middle

1214
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,900
will not see these patients

1215
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,500
won't find these patients

1216
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,860
but it doesn't matter

1217
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,000
he can still

1218
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,600
According to the collected

1219
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,100
whether complete data

1220
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:54,440
Or these so-called Sensor Data

1221
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,180
he can

1222
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:59,940
to get one of these patients

1223
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,000
This curve of survival

1224
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,360
So this is the Gibbon-Mine Curve

1225
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,600
good

1226
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,240
Okay, so is there any problem with the above?

1227
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,240
So my background has taken an hour

1228
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,240
So I only have 30 minutes left for my example

1229
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,240
good

1230
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,240
Well, that's our topic today

1231
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,240
that is

1232
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,240
What the statistics are doing I used two examples

1233
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,400
What I must tell you is that

1234
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:09,180
Of course statistics are doing too much

1235
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:13,140
The examples I can give are very limited to my own

1236
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,620
very limited experience

1237
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,420
So I'm sure you can learn from other statisticians

1238
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,060
get more interesting examples

1239
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:23,860
That

1240
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,600
My first example is earthquake risk assessment

1241
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,440
This is actually me

1242
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,940
i used to

1243
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:35,040
When I first became an actor, I told the world

1244
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,460
A researcher Cai Sovereign, Teacher Cai

1245
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,260
A study we collaborated on

1246
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,040
That is to continue with this

1247
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:48,060
Dr. Zhao from the National Earthquake Engineering Research Center

1248
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,860
Zhao Chuxian Dr. Zhao

1249
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,160
We continue our research on this

1250
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,040
Then I think everyone knows about earthquakes

1251
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,760
This one is of course for us

1252
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,980
big threat in taiwan

1253
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Then this is the earthquakes that happened in the past few years

1254
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,500
The location of the repression and the larger the circles represent

1255
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,500
The scale of its earthquake is bigger

1256
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,000
well then

1257
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Earthquake Engineers One Thing They're Important

1258
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:31,000
is to construct these earthquake-measured

1259
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
The so-called surface acceleration is when the earthquake shakes

1260
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,000
They will have an instrument measuring the acceleration of our surface

1261
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
It is very important for earthquake engineers to establish this

1262
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,000
this surface acceleration

1263
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
This is the skewed axis of the graph. Surface acceleration.

1264
00:59:54,500 --> 01:00:00,000
With the crackdown distance away from me this car

1265
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,320
The distance from my measuring station to my location

1266
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,360
one of

1267
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,800
Attenuation situation

1268
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,600
We know that if the distance

1269
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,440
If the suppression is farther away, of course the surface acceleration will be smaller

1270
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,760
Because the repression will be less

1271
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,440
Right, the closer you are, the greater the suppression

1272
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,240
So the surface acceleration will be greater

1273
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,560
there is another one

1274
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,880
The factor that affects this surface acceleration is of course the size of the earthquake.

1275
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,560
The scale is extremely extreme earthquake

1276
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:32,640
so

1277
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,400
It is important for earthquake engineers to construct this so-called

1278
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,240
Attenuation Model of Surface Acceleration

1279
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,600
According to this model, he can go

1280
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:44,840
predict

1281
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,480
These data are from these points are this

1282
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,080
These so-called seismic strong and low motion stations

1283
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,440
The actual data measured by surface acceleration

1284
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,840
That

1285
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,120
One of their very important things is to construct from these data

1286
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,560
to predict a place

1287
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,760
For example, a nuclear power plant

1288
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,600
or a school

1289
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,760
or a subway station

1290
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:24,560
That location is at a certain suppression distance

1291
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,000
and below the scale of an earthquake

1292
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,360
how much ground acceleration will it have

1293
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:37,760
Build engineering staff from here

1294
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,720
to build a nuclear power plant

1295
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,680
Or to build a subway station

1296
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,600
Or the engineers who want to build the school

1297
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,640
to design their building

1298
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,080
How strong is the seismic coefficient

1299
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,640
or safety factor

1300
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,720
So this is a very important job for them

1301
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,880
this is what they call

1302
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,500
Ground motion attenuation model or surface acceleration attenuation model

1303
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,700
What about this curve?

1304
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,300
is their mathematical model

1305
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,900
The mathematical model they constructed

1306
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,900
but what about the blue dot

1307
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,300
is the actual measured data

1308
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,300
So from here you can see that

1309
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,700
What about the data?

1310
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,500
Compared to this model

1311
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,500
still showed a very large

1312
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,400
Uncertainty right?

1313
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,900
That is to say, if you want to use this

1314
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,900
this model

1315
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:39,900
This is actually a so-called statistical regression model

1316
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,900
From such a regression model to predict

1317
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,900
an actual earthquake

1318
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,900
the ground acceleration it causes

1319
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,100
there is still a lot of uncertainty

1320
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,900
There is still a big error, right?

1321
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,900
great degree of change

1322
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,300
So at first

1323
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,560
As I just said, we have a lot of these book exhibitions in Taiwan

1324
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:07,200
Most of these book exhibitions are set up in primary and secondary schools.

1325
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,120
When an earthquake occurs there are measurements of surface acceleration

1326
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:16,000
These are the blue dots we just had

1327
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,400
So the question we now have to ask is

1328
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,520
is there any way we can say

1329
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,320
in just this

1330
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,320
a model, right?

1331
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:40,440
Then there's an error in the actual ground acceleration, right?

1332
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:45,720
Is there any way for us to further reduce this error?

1333
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,120
how to shrink it

1334
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,360
That is to say, is there any way for us to convert this error

1335
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,560
take this uncertainty

1336
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,240
uncertainty

1337
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,720
further broken down into

1338
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,200
this

1339
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,040
this is just now

1340
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,440
The mathematical model of this is to consider the scale of the earthquake

1341
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,960
After the distance from Zhenyang

1342
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,720
model, but the latter is full of errors

1343
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,160
That

1344
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,680
The decomposition of this error we would hope for

1345
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
It is hoped that further decomposition into

1346
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:23,320
One is the error caused by different earthquakes

1347
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,000
So that is to say, this part of the error can be determined by

1348
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:30,560
explained by the characteristics of the earthquake itself

1349
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:37,520
What about the other component of the error?

1350
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,400
Because of the nature of the station and the location itself

1351
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,760
caused by

1352
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,480
So this error is different locations

1353
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,920
Because some of it may be a basin

1354
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,560
Some may be on this hard rock

1355
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,320
some may be in the sand

1356
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,480
So it will cause its surface acceleration to be different

1357
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,760
So this part of the error?

1358
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Because of

1359
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,520
This part of this uncertainty

1360
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:10,880
is due to the characteristics between different locations

1361
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,180
this change

1362
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,680
this fairwayation

1363
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:16,680
what about the end

1364
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:21,080
The rest of this is that we can't have the properties of the earthquake itself

1365
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:26,800
or this error explained by the geological properties of the site itself

1366
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,800
so what

1367
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,800
all we have to do is say

1368
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,800
Mr. Cai

1369
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,800
when we come to discuss this issue

1370
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
we just wanted to say

1371
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,800
Is there a way outside of the original regression model

1372
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,800
take this further

1373
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,800
regression model

1374
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,800
The remaining error

1375
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,800
remaining uncertainty

1376
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,800
take this further

1377
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,800
Uncertainty caused by the earthquake itself

1378
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
take it

1379
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,800
jump out

1380
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,800
and because the location itself

1381
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,560
Uncertainty caused by the properties of Single it out

1382
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,640
In this case, when we make predictions later,

1383
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,480
According to the characteristics of the earthquake itself,

1384
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,600
and the characteristics of the place itself

1385
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,680
Further send this error to it

1386
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:20,280
So a more accurate error can be obtained

1387
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,280
more accurate predictions

1388
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,320
So here's our question

1389
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,920
our problem our approach

1390
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,000
In fact, using our statistics

1391
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,640
A very common tool in statistics

1392
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,240
is a so-called mixed effects model

1393
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,640
or a random effects model

1394
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,440
We add the original regression model to

1395
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:53,200
Due to the random effect caused by the earthquake

1396
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,040
and because of different locations

1397
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,640
Random effects caused by different strategies

1398
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,000
We all assume that this water accumulation effect is a normal distribution

1399
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:18,000
is the normal distribution of the central limit theorem we just saw

1400
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So what we want to know now is this normal distribution

1401
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Just mentioned its width, how much does it change

1402
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Because of this change, such as the effect of an earthquake

1403
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:41,000
The variation and width of its normal distribution can tell me

1404
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That is, because of the earthquake, this can be explained

1405
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
How much is this variation of farration How much is this ingredient

1406
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Then this location its normal distribution its this

1407
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,260
mutate it to this width

1408
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,260
it tells me that because of the location

1409
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,760
What is the extent of the change

1410
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,460
and finally this

1411
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,760
not explained by any reason that we know of

1412
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,260
this kind

1413
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,260
How much does the error vary

1414
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:21,760
so

1415
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,760
This is the parameter we want to know

1416
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,760
Known parameters

1417
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,260
So we just pass

1418
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,260
EM just said

1419
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,760
algorithm

1420
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:35,760
to perform this calculation on this model

1421
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:37,760
Calculation

1422
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,260
So we also have the so-called E-STEP

1423
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,260
Follow M-STEP

1424
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,260
E-STEP is to calculate

1425
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:48,260
the parts of us that don't see

1426
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,260
those papers

1427
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,260
what's the missing part

1428
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,260
That's what I just said

1429
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,260
earthquake

1430
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,260
the effect of

1431
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,260
Place

1432
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,960
The effect

1433
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:03,640
Why can't I see it? It's because

1434
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,200
he has been with

1435
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,320
Just now, these things in front of this are all mixed together.

1436
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,840
And the last error all mixed up

1437
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,280
We only saw this Y at the end

1438
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,520
Y is our surface acceleration

1439
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,400
So we have no way of actually seeing

1440
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,480
Effects due to seismic properties

1441
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,280
Effects on Surface Acceleration

1442
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,680
and the characteristics of the place

1443
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,960
Effects on Surface Acceleration

1444
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,240
So these are the parts that we don't see

1445
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,240
So we use Y

1446
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,720
replace it then max

1447
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,400
then this

1448
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,960
always

1449
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:43,960
overlapping tape finally converges it

1450
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,280
so

1451
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:49,720
I skipped all of these

1452
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,120
these are mathematical formulas

1453
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,400
i just skip it

1454
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,840
so in the end

1455
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,560
We can get these parameters

1456
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,720
components of these errors

1457
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,660
These parameters of the composition of these changes

1458
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,240
these parameters

1459
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,360
Then we can also get the predicted value of the surface acceleration

1460
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,040
Bring these parameters into

1461
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,040
bring in

1462
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,960
then go get it

1463
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:18,040
95% confidence interval or prediction interval

1464
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,500
Just like the poll example just now

1465
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:24,140
We can construct its prediction interval

1466
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:26,960
so what

1467
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,460
we use this

1468
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,240
period ratio

1469
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,440
this

1470
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,640
just these stations

1471
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,640
The resulting data

1472
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,540
In fact, most of these stations are operated by us

1473
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,840
The Central Weather Service and this us

1474
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,540
Academia Sinica's Institute of Earth Sciences

1475
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,040
they established

1476
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,740
so

1477
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:54,640
These are the earthquakes just mentioned

1478
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,440
Those ones

1479
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:57,240
Those Effects

1480
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,740
Those Earthquakes

1481
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,180
those

1482
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,560
These are those Sites those side stations

1483
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,160
so this is us

1484
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,100
The previous regression model

1485
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,100
M is the magnitude of the earthquake

1486
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:16,000
R is the distance from this point to the center

1487
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,960
So this is a common one for their earthquake engineering

1488
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,200
What the regression model looks like

1489
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,360
Then we have to do more than just this regression model

1490
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,360
what about us

1491
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,960
I also hope that this is the parameter value of this model

1492
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,960
We use the EM algorithm

1493
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,760
The resulting parameter value

1494
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,560
and the one with its central limit theorem

1495
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,860
the one with the normal distribution

1496
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,360
that

1497
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,460
the width of that change

1498
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,160
that

1499
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,460
that

1500
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:48,160
Error that standard arrow

1501
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,260
that standard

1502
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:52,960
good

1503
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:55,160
that this is that

1504
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,160
just said

1505
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,060
We have

1506
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:00,060
different earthquakes

1507
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,500
Caused change This parameter Amount of change

1508
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:08,500
The amount of variation caused by different locations

1509
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:14,500
Is there any way to explain it by all known causes

1510
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:18,500
The remaining changes, these uncertainties

1511
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:23,500
So is the estimate of the parameter of these parameters

1512
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,500
the values ​​of the parameters and their

1513
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:31,500
The degree of variation produced by sampling error

1514
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,500
its standard

1515
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,500
These are obtained by the EM algorithm

1516
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,500
Then this, Vice President Zhou just said

1517
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,000
Can we have such a model to know

1518
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Which side is safer and which side is less safe, right?

1519
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
So this is an example that says

1520
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,500
Because we can get the effect of the location, right?

1521
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:56,500
The impact of this site just now

1522
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,500
So here are some different tactics

1523
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,500
This is Yilan

1524
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,600
Hualien's Taipei's Kaohsiung's Yilan's

1525
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,320
so you can see it's slightly safer in this place

1526
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,000
A little bit because its surface acceleration will deduct a little bit

1527
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:10,880
right

1528
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,520
This place will also deduct a little, then this place will add

1529
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,760
plus a little plus a little more than average

1530
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,520
just add a little bit, right?

1531
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,040
so this is

1532
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,320
Predict this surface acceleration from the location

1533
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,280
An example is our original purpose

1534
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,160
At the beginning we just hoped that in

1535
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,160
above the original regression model, can we go further

1536
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,120
Pick out the effects of location Pick out the effects of earthquakes

1537
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,720
This way we can get more accurate predictions

1538
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,360
Well, this one is based on different earthquakes

1539
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,200
Pick out its effects and this one is

1540
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,160
921 This Extremely Large Earthquake

1541
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,360
Happened in 1999

1542
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,120
The 921 earthquake

1543
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
So this is what I just explained

1544
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
In fact, after you take the special factor of location into consideration

1545
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
What if you use this EM algorithm to make a prediction?

1546
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:19,000
You are actually better than the original regression model they used that did not take into account the location.

1547
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
When you construct its ninety-five stars to interval

1548
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Realization This diagram may not be clear

1549
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Achieving this is its range

1550
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You can see that for this strategy in Taipei

1551
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Well, actually, it turns out that this didn’t take into account the location.

1552
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
What about the prediction interval at the 95-star level?

1553
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
doesn't cover ground acceleration at this location at all

1554
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Right, this range is here

1555
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
But it is not included in the strategy of Taipei

1556
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:59,000
is not covered by this prediction interval of the ninety-five

1557
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,000
But if you consider the site conditions of the station itself

1558
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
The interval you construct will be this dotted line

1559
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:17,000
So you can see that it will better cover the surface acceleration of this location

1560
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:21,000
The same is true for a station in Kaohsiung

1561
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
This location of this station is here

1562
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,000
This its PGA surface acceleration is here

1563
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
This is the 95% prediction interval constructed based on the characteristics of the site

1564
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
That realization is this interval

1565
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Implementations also include live without taking into account

1566
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Those who did not consider the characteristics of this site are also included in the station in Kaohsiung

1567
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
But its location is on the edge

1568
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
good

1569
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
The EM algorithm just mentioned is a very general method

1570
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,680
So in fact, this earthquake engineering expert

1571
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,040
they hope that means

1572
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,560
if my

1573
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,160
What if the effect of my earthquake is

1574
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,640
Just this model is

1575
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,360
The effect of an earthquake is the same

1576
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,920
all earthquakes

1577
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,480
effect is the same

1578
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:31,680
That

1579
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:33,640
Earthquake engineers asked

1580
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,480
Then if the effect of my earthquake will follow

1581
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,080
Will it be different in size?

1582
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,600
I think this is a very reasonable question

1583
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,840
Then we can easily

1584
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,440
Take this EM algorithm slightly

1585
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,720
rewrite it

1586
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:51,120
we can go and calculate

1587
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,880
Above is my first example

1588
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,120
My first example to summarize

1589
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,080
that is

1590
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,260
Now we have very, very many in Taiwan

1591
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:05,960
They now have a very

1592
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:07,260
have a database

1593
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,260
So I think you can apply with them if you want to use it.

1594
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,260
That

1595
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:20,620
In fact, the statistical regression has been

1596
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:25,360
model approach has been used for this surface acceleration

1597
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,860
The construction of the decay model

1598
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:31,860
From which to evaluate the so-called Size Mihaasang

1599
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,860
earthquake risk

1600
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,860
But we can use more

1601
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,860
A more refined statistical model

1602
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:45,860
For example, as shown here

1603
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:51,860
The so-called mixed-effects or random-effects model

1604
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:56,860
We can further take the original regression model inside

1605
01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:58,860
What about the variable part?

1606
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Further according to different sources

1607
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
different ingredients

1608
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
For example from Earthquake itself

1609
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
from Sight itself

1610
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
to further disassemble

1611
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,000
get more accurate forecasts

1612
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
statistical algorithm

1613
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
like 1M algorithm

1614
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
can help us do this

1615
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Statistical Proxy Sample Theory

1616
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
You can also help us further

1617
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Evaluate the resulting model on the data

1618
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:47,000
its error how much its uncertainty

1619
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
So this is my first example

1620
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Thanks

1621
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Well, the second example is to follow the popular big data

1622
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
hope there is a little connection

1623
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So here's an example of integration of different databases

1624
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Now because, a lot of databases, a lot of this database

1625
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It's all there for everyone to use, whether it's a government agency.

1626
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
or a private institution

1627
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Slowly now because of the trend of big data, there may be more and more such data

1628
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
What about this data? Its advantage is that it is usually very large.

1629
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
A large amount because it can be very cumulative for very many people

1630
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Daily life, for example, it is called UBIKE, right?

1631
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Its records, or our health care records, our doctor's records

1632
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
so everyone

1633
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
A large amount of data accumulated for a long time every day

1634
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
So its advantage is that it has a large amount

1635
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
but on the other hand

1636
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It has the disadvantage that

1637
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Because it wasn't meant for a real one

1638
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Collected for the purpose of measuring something in detail

1639
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
So what about its data?

1640
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
The quality may be rough

1641
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
There may be a lot of errors, right?

1642
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
what about the other

1643
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
even

1644
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
For example, like the health insurance database

1645
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Anyone who has analyzed the health insurance database knows that

1646
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Actually because

1647
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Currently because of

1648
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
The so-called capital

1649
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
so-called personal privacy

1650
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
is guaranteed

1651
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
so

1652
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
you can't just say

1653
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,000
you can't get these

1654
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,800
Although it has large data

1655
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,000
But you can't get its personal data

1656
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,280
Our statistical analysis needs it for a long time

1657
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,440
individual data personal data

1658
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,000
One by one we can analyze

1659
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,400
but now

1660
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,600
it allows you to analyze

1661
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,000
But it doesn't let you take this profile back

1662
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,800
You can only take the results of the analysis

1663
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,000
That is, Somber is the taste is

1664
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,000
These sufficient statistics bring back

1665
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,800
Like the so-called we went to the Ministry of Health and Welfare

1666
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,800
value-added center

1667
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,800
That's it

1668
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,200
you can go in and sit at its computer

1669
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,000
To analyze the health insurance database

1670
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,600
but when you go

1671
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,800
It can only bring out your analysis results

1672
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,600
You can't bring the data out

1673
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,400
good

1674
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,800
but on the other hand

1675
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,760
A person or some may exist now

1676
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,760
existing some

1677
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,440
For other databases it might be

1678
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,920
There are finer

1679
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,760
measured to some

1680
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,560
the data you want

1681
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,560
These databases may exist or

1682
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,000
yourself if

1683
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,760
If there is such a data to be collected

1684
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,200
That's the kind of information you have on hand.

1685
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:30,960
right

1686
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,760
So a natural question is to say

1687
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,520
Here you have some very

1688
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,680
detailed measurement data

1689
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,960
But because it's finely measured

1690
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,960
so its amount

1691
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,520
maybe not too big

1692
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,000
right

1693
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,600
because

1694
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,320
Fine measurements cost a lot of money

1695
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:47,720
right

1696
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,320
you can't measure too many people

1697
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,520
too many people

1698
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,240
So you have a profile like this

1699
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,240
is it possible to follow

1700
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,240
the one above

1701
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,500
this huge database

1702
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:06,100
it's big

1703
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,400
a lot of it

1704
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,000
but a little rough

1705
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:11,100
How can you combine these two

1706
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,700
database combined

1707
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,700
so this is us

1708
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,200
question to ask

1709
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,600
Okay, so our motivation is to say

1710
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,800
There is a doctor who has one at hand

1711
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,500
National Health Interview Survey

1712
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,300
That this is 2005

1713
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,200
this is

1714
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,400
National Institutes of Health in Taiwan

1715
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,500
and the National Health Service

1716
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,500
what they

1717
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,000
an interview survey

1718
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,800
This is a very detailed visit

1719
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:41,100
More than 20,000 residents of Taiwan

1720
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,000
very carefully

1721
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,700
Ask them what diseases they have

1722
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,900
and then include their diet

1723
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,400
their living habits

1724
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,800
their smoking and drinking

1725
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:52,300
so

1726
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,600
There is such a database

1727
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,900
This is a very detailed database

1728
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,300
but this database

1729
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,200
Relatively speaking, the amount is not that large

1730
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That's all, more than 20,000 people

1731
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
What the doctor wants to analyze is

1732
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
because he found

1733
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
patients with herpes zoster

1734
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Herpes zoster I don't know everyone

1735
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Do you know what kind of disease this is?

1736
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
It's a disease of the immune system

1737
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
he is in pain

1738
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
It's a sharp pain

1739
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,000
If you have this rash

1740
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,000
it will be very painful

1741
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
you must see a doctor

1742
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
will definitely see a doctor

1743
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Then the doctor found

1744
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Many people who get shingles with this shingles

1745
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
He also has COPD

1746
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
COPD

1747
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
so he just watched

1748
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Are these two diseases related?

1749
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
do you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

1750
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
prone to herpes zoster

1751
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
that's in this

1752
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
If he wants to discuss such issues

1753
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
he has a lot

1754
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Other variables to consider

1755
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
for example

1756
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
There are a lot more

1757
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
other comorbidities

1758
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
comorbidity

1759
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
such as high blood pressure, diabetes

1760
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,120
These will be accompanied by both levels of water

1761
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,620
together with the

1762
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,820
Then there is smoking and drinking

1763
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,500
especially smoking

1764
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,520
because

1765
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,520
Many people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are

1766
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,420
Primers

1767
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:19,420
I mean smoke a lot

1768
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:22,440
It is easy for smokers to get

1769
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,500
Ribbon foam pillow

1770
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,860
so

1771
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,220
smoking is an important

1772
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,820
this

1773
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,320
Factors that must be included in the analysis

1774
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:34,320
and drinking

1775
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,320
So these data can be found in

1776
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:39,320
National Health Survey in French

1777
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,320
This is a very detailed investigation

1778
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,320
But it's not that big

1779
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,320
So the doctor thought

1780
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,320
Then can I use the health insurance database?

1781
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,320
Because now the health insurance database

1782
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,320
very hot right now

1783
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,320
The health insurance database is missing.

1784
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,820
smoking and drinking

1785
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,820
no smoking and drinking

1786
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,320
data

1787
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,320
how about

1788
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,380
In this way, the health insurance database lacks smoking and drinking

1789
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:08,700
The result of such an analysis we call

1790
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,780
one reduce model one

1791
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:17,920
A scaled down model because it's less smoking and less drinking, right?

1792
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:23,300
So what about the results? It’s the same as your National Health Interview Survey.

1793
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,580
fine this

1794
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,620
results combined

1795
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,100
ok so here it is

1796
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,380
There are some

1797
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,680
a little symbol

1798
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,240
YX stands for Y

1799
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,320
It's ours. This one we're going to see is

1800
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:44,840
Ribbon foam pillow

1801
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,120
X is

1802
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:51,500
Do you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other comorbid diseases?

1803
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:59,180
But what we are talking about now is that the data is obtained from external data, which is the so-called health insurance database.

1804
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
A large database gets

1805
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,500
So it's missing some other variables

1806
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,500
such as smoking and drinking

1807
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,000
that's okay

1808
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,500
We use this simplified model

1809
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:15,500
reduced model

1810
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,500
we get a final

1811
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,000
Summary

1812
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,500
A Summary's TASY

1813
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:23,000
Let's say Said

1814
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
That's because the health insurance database

1815
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Can't take its personal information directly

1816
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So we can only use this Summary's TASY

1817
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It describes the relationship between Y and X

1818
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Then it is more precise

1819
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Our name is Internal Data

1820
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
In addition to Y and X

1821
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
it also has z

1822
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
some more details

1823
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
such as smoking and drinking

1824
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
So if you analyze Y X Z

1825
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
integrated analysis

1826
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
A Summary of what you can get

1827
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Summary is Beta

1828
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Beta

1829
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
The main purpose of statistical inference

1830
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,980
So how do we combine the two together?

1831
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,640
How to combine beta and seta

1832
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,340
One is the lack of some data

1833
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:18,400
It is a summary of what we call the reduce model

1834
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,440
One is the summary beta of the complete information

1835
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,120
How do these two fit together?

1836
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,000
In fact, it is very simple, we just use the law of large numbers

1837
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,320
Because according to the law of large numbers

1838
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,000
This seta this summary statistic

1839
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,240
it will approach this

1840
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,560
The real value of this group

1841
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:40,280
And the real value of the group will be related to beta

1842
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,880
Because according to one of our probability theory

1843
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:45,520
The simplest formula is called total probability

1844
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,800
The law of total probability, right?

1845
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,320
The law of total probability tells us

1846
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,080
total probability tells us

1847
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,960
total probability is

1848
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,440
Conditional probability multiplied by marginal probability

1849
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:56,200
right

1850
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,640
So we are based on this simple one

1851
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,300
Law of Large Numbers and Total Product Rate

1852
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,000
we can go build

1853
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
The relationship between β and θ

1854
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,300
So if you go through the health insurance database now

1855
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,200
You already know the words θ

1856
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,700
It represents β to some extent

1857
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:19,000
also satisfy a relationship history

1858
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
So at this time our statistical inference

1859
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,500
We just wanted statistical inference

1860
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,000
The pursuit of process optimization, right?

1861
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,500
So when we require the maximum value of the target content

1862
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:36,000
We are no longer just the original maximum.

1863
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,500
We also add that because of the external data

1864
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,000
message to me

1865
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
a history of our relationship

1866
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,500
So this is the use of

1867
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,000
We are in the Elementary Wikipedia

1868
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Learned method of Lockrange Multi-Prior

1869
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
that is, with restrictions

1870
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Let us seek the optimization of an objective content

1871
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
So we just use this simple trick

1872
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
We can combine external data with internal data

1873
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
then we can also get

1874
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
The central limit theorem of such statistical inferences

1875
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
That is, it varies with sampling

1876
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Its changes still obey a normal law

1877
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
And the width of the normal and its variation

1878
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
can be calculated by the formula

1879
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
and we found

1880
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,000
The width of this normal distribution and its variation must be greater than

1881
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Its error, the sampling error, must be greater than

1882
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
You only use your original Internal Data

1883
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So it means that you use these additional data

1884
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
use these health care databases use these external data

1885
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,400
is helpful

1886
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,400
It reduces your sampling error

1887
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,000
ok so

1888
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,900
Another one we can combine with internal data

1889
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,100
methods with external data

1890
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,600
Also using the central limit theorem

1891
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,700
We use the bivariate normality relationship

1892
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:22,800
You can build this β and θ

1893
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,100
Remember that β is the parameter of our exact model

1894
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,400
θ is our external data

1895
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:33,300
Compare Simplify compares the parameters of the reduced model

1896
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,900
You use a central limit theorem

1897
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:37,500
Using the relationship of bivariate normal distribution

1898
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,200
It is also possible to construct the relationship between these two parameters

1899
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,500
This is also a way

1900
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,500
You can combine internal data with external data

1901
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:47,800
so what

1902
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,100
finally

1903
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,100
What about the results of our analysis?

1904
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:52,800
That's it

1905
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,900
that is

1906
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,000
If we only use the health insurance database

1907
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:58,100
This is a

1908
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,000
This analysis is a comparative

1909
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Simplified Analysis

1910
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
because he failed to take into account two important variables

1911
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
smoking and drinking

1912
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
So under such analysis

1913
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
we got this code foam pillow

1914
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Relationship with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

1915
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
is 1.7

1916
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
What does that mean

1917
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:27,000
That is to say, people who have foam pillows

1918
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,000
he will get this later

1919
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Patients with COPD

1920
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
I've mispoken

1921
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Patients with COPD

1922
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The risk that he will get a proxy pillow at a later date

1923
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
is without COPD

1924
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
patients without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

1925
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
1.7 times

1926
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
That is, if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

1927
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:59,000
you will have higher

1928
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,960
risk to get this bandage

1929
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,920
This multiple is 1.7 times

1930
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,000
But what about such an analysis?

1931
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,400
is a rough analysis

1932
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,360
Simplified Analysis

1933
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,040
because it's only based on the health insurance database

1934
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:15,760
There is no information about smoking and drinking

1935
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,600
So if you use the National Health Interview Survey

1936
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,280
it has all the data

1937
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,880
But its data volume is relatively small

1938
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,040
Its Sumpo Size

1939
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,920
Its sample size is relatively small

1940
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,200
The result you get is something like this

1941
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,960
what does it mean

1942
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:32,960
that is, chronic obstructive

1943
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:34,320
What about non-disease patients?

1944
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,880
His risk of getting banding

1945
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,960
is not chronic obstructive

1946
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,360
2.83 times that of non-disease patients

1947
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,640
This risk increases

1948
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,840
But it should be noted that

1949
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,560
its central limit theorem

1950
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:54,120
The one in the normal distribution

1951
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,200
What about the smoking variant?

1952
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,000
that width

1953
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Just imagine the normal width

1954
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,460
also quite big

1955
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:03,840
This means that your result

1956
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,460
because your sample size

1957
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:08,460
Everyone remembers that it consumes 1/M more, right?

1958
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:11,620
So your sample size is relatively small

1959
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:14,860
so your error

1960
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,860
Your sampling error will be relatively large

1961
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,340
So 1.56

1962
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,220
So even though you have such a big risk

1963
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:24,860
But because your uncertainty is also great

1964
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,660
So we have to calculate a ratio in the end

1965
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:30,500
This ratio is generally greater than 2

1966
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:33,020
We'd better do this significantly

1967
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:34,580
That is to say, the p value is small

1968
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,180
The p value just mentioned

1969
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:38,060
be less than 0.05

1970
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,300
So what is the current ratio?

1971
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:44,340
That is to say its statistic itself

1972
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:47,180
the estimator itself compared to its uncertainty

1973
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:50,140
Compared with its stand arrow

1974
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,260
This ratio does not exceed 2

1975
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:55,740
So its result is not significant enough

1976
01:34:55,740 --> 01:34:58,780
so i can't draw any firm conclusions

1977
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,840
But if you use the two

1978
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,040
This combination of internal and external data

1979
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,040
Combining health insurance database with

1980
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,440
The data from the National Health Interview Survey

1981
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:14,440
The result you get is this

1982
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:15,940
this

1983
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:19,600
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease causes

1984
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,440
Risks of Ribbon Pillows

1985
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,240
This multiple is almost 1.9 times

1986
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,640
but its this

1987
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,440
sampling error

1988
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,680
Everyone remembers the one with the normal distribution

1989
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,280
that width that error

1990
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,480
also dropped to only 0.11

1991
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,040
Only a tenth of the original size is smaller

1992
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,680
so what

1993
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,280
This will make your

1994
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,240
pen value

1995
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,080
your

1996
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:46,240
Estimated value divided by its standarrow pen value

1997
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:47,240
yes

1998
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,880
more than 10

1999
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,080
so it's very, very significant

2000
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,880
So its p-value is 0.05

2001
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,280
So this illustrates this

2002
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,640
you combine

2003
01:35:58,440 --> 01:35:59,440
External materials

2004
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
analysis is helpful

2005
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,160
can reduce your sampling error

2006
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,480
I think I'll just use these two examples

2007
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,480
with everyone

2008
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:15,600
explain

2009
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,160
what i do

2010
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,640
that's statistics

2011
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:21,840
doing something

2012
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,600
Of course, this is just my personal one-sided

2013
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:27,240
very one-sided things

2014
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:32,160
Let's see if you have any questions

2015
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,600
ok thank you

2016
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,120
Some of Mr. Chen's

2017
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,920
made a with us

2018
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,680
equal to an overview

2019
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,360
for this statistical

2020
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,840
some things you can do

2021
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,960
that's how we are now

2022
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,360
Our organizers are ready

2023
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,440
scientific magazine

2024
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,440
There are

2025
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,640
There are about 10 copies, so every guest who asks a question

2026
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,440
can get 1 copy

2027
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:10,100
So we can start from this sequence of questions

2028
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:13,240
We will be giving away this hope to finish the 10 copies

2029
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:17,880
Okay, is there anyone in the audience right now?

2030
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,440
this way first thank you

2031
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:28,400
Hello, Mr. Chong, let me ask you about the application examples behind you

2032
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:35,040
In the approach of ground acceleration for earthquake engineering

2033
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:38,340
Is your R the epicenter or the epicenter? I’m just curious.

2034
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:39,840
this is the first little problem

2035
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,000
The second part is whether there is a way to do anti-authentication

2036
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,800
For example, Taipei City is in the side-to-side valuation

2037
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,300
Is it relatively larger

2038
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:54,940
Because everyone in Taipei knows that there is a formation amplification effect

2039
01:37:54,940 --> 01:38:00,040
Is it possible to improve the reliability and validity?

2040
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,700
and then go further to give feedback

2041
01:38:01,700 --> 01:38:03,240
your original model

2042
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,540
Thanks

2043
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,040
Yes, I think this R should refer to

2044
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,080
Did you just ask about politics?

2045
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:12,680
It's still Zhengyuan, right?

2046
01:38:12,680 --> 01:38:13,740
because you just said politics

2047
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,380
So I'm curious to say

2048
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:17,380
Why not Zhengyuan

2049
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:20,080
Zhengyuan is the real legend drama

2050
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,180
this is normal

2051
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,280
Yes, it is actually divided into two dramas

2052
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,020
Actually, I'm not very clear about the details.

2053
01:38:27,020 --> 01:38:28,660
one should be what you mean

2054
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,300
Just the picture I just had

2055
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,960
that is to say it has

2056
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:33,900
when they define the play

2057
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,760
There are indeed some differences

2058
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,060
defined method

2059
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:38,100
that one is political

2060
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,240
One possibility is the political source you mentioned

2061
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,240
So both are used

2062
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:43,800
right

2063
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:44,940
The second point is that

2064
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,380
what you just said is

2065
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:48,480
If according to the characteristics of this address

2066
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,440
For example, what is pious or something?

2067
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,680
Can I get it from here again?

2068
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,980
I think that's what we're here for

2069
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,280
That is to say, to take the characteristics of this place

2070
01:38:59,280 --> 01:38:59,840
want

2071
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,640
access to our forecast

2072
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:05,000
You can get some more precise analysis

2073
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
right

2074
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,240
Then you say in this from

2075
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,680
What about getting some corrections

2076
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:09,680
i think it is

2077
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:12,880
In order to get more accurate predictions

2078
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,680
right

2079
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:15,640
Okay, thank you

2080
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,480
Everyone, the next one

2081
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,480
Teacher Chen

2082
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,080
i have two questions

2083
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:22,640
The first question is to say

2084
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,480
when you're predicting low

2085
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,880
you have already happened

2086
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,080
So you collect a lot of data

2087
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,760
for analysis

2088
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,160
So can you predict

2089
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,480
Who did he say would happen

2090
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,120
There is a second question

2091
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:37,360
in case he happens

2092
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,080
you know where he is

2093
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,440
but can you predict

2094
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,920
How far can he go

2095
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,720
range of influence

2096
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,720
Yes, then I have to type these two questions

2097
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:49,040
i didn't do it

2098
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,640
Yes because there may be some

2099
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,640
doing such a problem

2100
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:52,920
For example, predict

2101
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:55,360
when hypoxia occurs

2102
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,040
Then

2103
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,400
Also, his positive wave

2104
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:00,440
maybe

2105
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,760
How far does it radiate

2106
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:05,340
But I must say I have no experience with either of these

2107
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,040
because

2108
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,100
that is

2109
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:12,740
The earthquakes I have come into contact with are all biased

2110
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,900
so-called earthquake engineering

2111
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,240
as you just said

2112
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,400
an earthquake that has occurred

2113
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,700
then we go from it

2114
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:22,340
and look at its acceleration against the ground

2115
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:24,140
and its impact on buildings

2116
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:25,800
what we studied

2117
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,740
I didn't come across some

2118
01:40:27,740 --> 01:40:31,240
Possibly study some of the earthquake itself

2119
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:35,340
some scientific nature

2120
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:36,980
when will it happen

2121
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:39,400
And then how does its shock wave propagate

2122
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,380
I don't have that

2123
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:44,440
no contact

2124
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:45,080
right

2125
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:46,240
Thanks

2126
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:46,540
right

2127
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,280
Okay, thank you

2128
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,480
the third one is here

2129
01:40:49,180 --> 01:40:49,540
Wait a moment

2130
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:51,440
Hello Mr. Chen

2131
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,280
Here

2132
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:53,940
Where

2133
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:54,380
good

2134
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,140
sorry

2135
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,180
sorry sorry

2136
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:57,380
like this

2137
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:00,120
because i saw you doing this earthquake

2138
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
this model

2139
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That's because I just happened to be a while ago

2140
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
We just had the sudden thought of saying

2141
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Let's just use that

2142
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Low power consumption unlimited power and that

2143
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
the chipped one

2144
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Accelerometer

2145
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
It's a six-axis accelerometer

2146
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,000
to put in some fixed position

2147
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Then it becomes a lot of distribution points

2148
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
This will form a sensor network

2149
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
and then to sense those points above

2150
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
The vibrating Megane2

2151
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
The strength of its government, etc.

2152
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
But so I see say this

2153
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Mr. Chen, you are here

2154
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I have done a lot of information on this

2155
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
It should be ten years, right?

2156
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
your sensor

2157
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Because the main thing is your sensor

2158
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,000
You still have the value it returns later

2159
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
your values

2160
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Mainly how can you be sure to say

2161
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
its values ​​are believable

2162
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Because if you say that you use the accelerometer to judge

2163
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
In fact, there will be a big problem, that is,

2164
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Not necessarily an earthquake

2165
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Maybe it's just a landslide today

2166
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Or maybe there is a project nearby

2167
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Big trucks drive by and he still vibrates

2168
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Under such circumstances, Mr. Chen, your materials

2169
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Have you done this kind of filtering such as reliability and so on?

2170
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
In fact, they originally said that the data

2171
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
They received confirmation in this database

2172
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
he is an earthquake

2173
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Because every time an earthquake occurs, the Central Meteorological Bureau will announce

2174
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
So sure it's an earthquake

2175
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Right, so they're all sure

2176
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
These surface accelerations from this earthquake

2177
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,000
they will be included in this database

2178
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
So if what you just said is some other landslide

2179
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Or a big truck has been driven

2180
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Or the MRT has been opened, the high-speed rail has been opened

2181
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Then they should not be included in this earthquake

2182
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,600
included, so they have to do some manual judgment

2183
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,800
to themselves and then snap out some unnecessary parts

2184
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,800
Yes, when they were building this database

2185
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,800
should do this

2186
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,300
OK OK OK

2187
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:16,800
Right, well, what about your accelerometer itself?

2188
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,000
Are there any problems that need to be corrected?

2189
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,200
Because of this when we actually do

2190
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:23,600
This problem happened, it seems to have heard them talking

2191
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,600
But this is not our specialty.

2192
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,600
then they seem to have listened

2193
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,900
as if i heard them say

2194
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:31,400
they need to do some corrections or something

2195
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:36,900
Yes, assuming the information they provide should be

2196
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:37,900
it's right it's right

2197
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:40,900
A certain design is correct from which statistical analysis

2198
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:41,900
Yeah

2199
01:43:41,900 --> 01:43:44,900
The one behind just now, and the one who waits a little longer

2200
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:46,900
just a little bit of advice

2201
01:43:46,900 --> 01:43:48,600
That is to say, in statistics

2202
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,900
part that is said to be man-made

2203
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:53,600
It's like talking about earthquakes when I was studying in high school

2204
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,400
It's some water currents hitting plates.

2205
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,400
But if say, hypothesis says need experiment say

2206
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
is it security

2207
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
How shockproof is it?

2208
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
that might be

2209
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Bo Jun's bomb is under the ground

2210
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Explosion at the bottom of the sea

2211
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
The kind of vibration that spread out in Taiwan

2212
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
it's also possible

2213
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
that or

2214
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
for some military precautions

2215
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
or experiment

2216
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
such data

2217
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
how to include

2218
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
That and the gentleman just said

2219
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
If it is possible to do so

2220
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
If the operation experiment

2221
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Is it possible to predict

2222
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Naturally occurring and man-made situations

2223
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
because why is it so small

2224
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Because I often spend three thousand midnight

2225
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
half done washing

2226
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
Why another earthquake

2227
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
that's too often

2228
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I feel that it is the same as the theory of studying in high school before

2229
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
a little weird

2230
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
so i want to say

2231
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Is it an artificial perception

2232
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
i want them this

2233
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
as long as i just said

2234
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
That is to say, they should just consider

2235
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
caused by the earthquake

2236
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,000
surface acceleration

2237
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
they don't think about it

2238
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
what you just said

2239
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
human factors

2240
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,600
let's add

2241
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:04,100
The man for the nuclear bomb test

2242
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:08,100
Will he form energy dollars

2243
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,600
Then the shares I form are

2244
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,600
I don't know

2245
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,900
Because I do not know

2246
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:16,400
I don't know if Taiwan is still conducting nuclear tests

2247
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,400
this

2248
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,800
I think this chance should be less

2249
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,600
Of course, if it's from North Korea or somewhere else

2250
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,200
then i don't know

2251
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:28,400
Does the region have this

2252
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,100
Yes but this

2253
01:45:30,100 --> 01:45:30,900
i think both

2254
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:33,300
none of them will appear again

2255
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:34,900
The one we are analyzing now

2256
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:38,300
In the so-called surface acceleration data of earthquakes

2257
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:40,800
In other words, statistics and computers

2258
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,700
Our statistics mean

2259
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,200
we see our purpose

2260
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,700
Our purpose is only to analyze earthquakes

2261
01:45:46,700 --> 01:45:47,300
right

2262
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:51,500
Hello

2263
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:53,100
right here

2264
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,500
Just learned that thread

2265
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,900
When you say that thread treasure is very much needed

2266
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Which means he had the opportunity to study the life of this individual

2267
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,000
But health insurance can solve personal life

2268
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
on top of the male

2269
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
other human life

2270
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
After continuing to study

2271
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
When an old man comes and goes, he still holds

2272
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
The person who holds this condition

2273
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
will

2274
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
In other words, the impact on the whole

2275
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Then we are now in Taiwan

2276
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
The former health team leader Yang Zhiqiang also said

2277
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Planetary aging in Taiwan

2278
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
2.82 million

2279
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
in this situation

2280
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Our Mr. Fu Daren

2281
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
poor kiln lady

2282
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
If they are like this

2283
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
This angle is accumulating

2284
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Cumulative to zero rigid angle

2285
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
at best

2286
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,000
at best

2287
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
what do we do

2288
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
to solve the problem

2289
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
For example, the Anning Project

2290
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Is it going to pass

2291
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Is this the case in Taiwan?

2292
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
That is to say, I want to ask you to say

2293
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
between you personally and collectively

2294
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
place to take

2295
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I think this is probably what people in their health policy have to consider

2296
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:12,100
Then the only thing statistics can do is to provide them with some real-world data.

2297
01:47:12,100 --> 01:47:12,900
right

2298
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:18,300
Then as you just said, prolonging personal life or

2299
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:23,300
For the whole country and society because of the senile dementia you just mentioned

2300
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:26,000
How to balance the diseases of aging

2301
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I think their health policy will make policy based on our data

2302
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
right

2303
01:47:35,000 --> 01:48:00,000
good

2304
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:00,500
learn

2305
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:10,920
There are often problems with missing children

2306
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:14,000
For example, we are distinguishing between healthy people and

2307
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,480
sick person that

2308
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,080
When doing grouping, there are some missing children, so there are some statistics

2309
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:21,560
If the method encounters a shortage, he can only use this

2310
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,960
Sampo sacrificed him

2311
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,120
But we are not willing to sacrifice too much SAMPO

2312
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,920
Because sometimes it is not easy to obtain, so is there a time like this?

2313
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:31,120
Some ways to overcome these problems

2314
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:33,720
Yes, very, very much, yes, like what I just said

2315
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,280
EM algorithm is very suitable

2316
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,520
because what I just said

2317
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,040
The EM algorithm says

2318
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:43,640
Some parts of your model can be without

2319
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:46,360
I see, the deficiency you just mentioned means there is no

2320
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:47,840
You see it, right?

2321
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,240
So you're in the EM algorithm

2322
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,760
What about the first step? You can put the

2323
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:55,320
The part seen finds a way to use a reasonable

2324
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,040
This missing piece will replace it, right?

2325
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:00,400
Then go get a reasonable

2326
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,700
Yes, there are many other ways

2327
01:49:02,700 --> 01:49:04,500
that is to say in this

2328
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,900
The lack of fat you just mentioned, the loss of fat?

2329
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:10,500
This is the focus of statistics and a study of statistics

2330
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:11,500
right

2331
01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:16,500
So I think you should be able to find this kind of method easily

2332
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:20,100
Okay, we have two questions here.

2333
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,500
First off, I'm sorry

2334
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:25,500
Literary advice means when you

2335
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:28,500
A little more information about medicine

2336
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:32,000
When you have more information and more information about smoking and drinking

2337
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
in the whole model

2338
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,500
When you have some other relevant and useful information

2339
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:42,000
With this strip pillow and this lung condition

2340
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Then you probably shouldn't increase

2341
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Because of the added information

2342
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
So you probably shouldn't increase

2343
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
That is to say, foam pillows affect lung diseases.

2344
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,500
this variation

2345
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
In fact you are lowered Virgin much lower

2346
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,000
but here's the problem

2347
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
I kind of disagree with your Standard Arrow

2348
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
able to lower that much

2349
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
It is because when you have a lot of information

2350
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
does not represent a change in your main parameter

2351
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
should be bigger

2352
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
so i have a little doubt

2353
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Against my decades of statistical experience

2354
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
so i don't quite agree

2355
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
That change can be so dramatic

2356
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
This is the first point

2357
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Second, if you have earthquake data

2358
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
when your different site

2359
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
in different intensities

2360
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
I suggest you take another factor into consideration

2361
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
That is to say, you travel from Zheng Yuan to Taipei City

2362
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
When you go to different places in Kaohsiung

2363
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
It this Pass

2364
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
It has different Pass

2365
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Where the Pass passes

2366
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
that average change

2367
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
That change can probably be described a little bit

2368
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Describe the change of that Pass

2369
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
very important

2370
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
OK

2371
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
right

2372
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
so i suggest you first

2373
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Thank you very very much Mr. Chen

2374
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,000
And Mr. Chen is a very experienced

2375
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
The lifted statistician

2376
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,000
I was taken aback by the question he just asked

2377
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
right

2378
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
first question

2379
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
that is to say, i admit that is to say

2380
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
We do this for different databases

2381
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
combine

2382
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Companation actually requires some assumptions

2383
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
how is your result

2384
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
to some extent

2385
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
will be influenced by your assumptions

2386
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Then of course we are here

2387
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
because our assumptions about our assumptions

2388
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
These two databases

2389
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
The material it contains is quite homogenous

2390
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
So that is to say, such a combibe

2391
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
like a lot

2392
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Especially as big as the health insurance database

2393
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
as soon as you bring it in

2394
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
can force a lot

2395
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
But I fully admit that

2396
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
totally agree that is to say

2397
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
This is of course an assumption that

2398
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Assuming the two databases

2399
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,160
National Health Insurance Database and National Health Interview

2400
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:03,560
very homogenous

2401
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:06,200
Like Teacher Chen just said

2402
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:09,040
Actually, I think what you mean is to say

2403
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,360
In fact, if the two are different

2404
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:15,560
It's a bit different population, right?

2405
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:18,640
So their own parameter values

2406
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:20,560
maybe it's different

2407
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,560
he himself will have a variation

2408
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:25,560
so you bring it in

2409
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:28,200
May instead increase variation

2410
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:29,960
not reduce information

2411
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,720
then i totally agree

2412
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:33,720
it is possible

2413
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:36,400
But this means that it needs to be considered

2414
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:38,000
another model

2415
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,920
For example, mature model or something

2416
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:44,400
Then consider the question

2417
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:47,200
That is, if we want to combine

2418
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:51,760
are two very different populations

2419
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,120
how would that be

2420
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:58,840
ok then your second question

2421
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,240
Actually I just skipped it

2422
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I didn't talk about it, I just said it. In fact, we were here later.

2423
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
This regression model of this

2424
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
It's Fariousion's this

2425
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,000
As for the dismantling, we actually considered it later.

2426
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
You just talked about the problem of this Pass

2427
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
We have also considered the issue of Pass

2428
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:25,000
It is different Effects for different side stations

2429
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
The impact of its Pass

2430
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
So this will make this

2431
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
will make this

2432
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,000
The prediction error will be further reduced

2433
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
teacher long time no see

2434
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Yes, long time no see. It's my master student.

2435
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
right

2436
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I just heard the teacher mention the total probability theorem

2437
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
theorem it can be integrated

2438
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
right

2439
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Integrate data from different databases

2440
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,000
right

2441
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
For example, when some databases are very large

2442
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Information about my different consultations every day

2443
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
and then restore it

2444
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Then combine them to get a more accurate number

2445
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Just upgrade that database

2446
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
The computational efficiency looks like this

2447
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Your question is about using the full chance

2448
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Can improve the efficiency of operation

2449
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Yes, we didn't actually consider

2450
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Operational efficiency

2451
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Our side is actually

2452
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
think of a way

2453
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Link internal data with external data

2454
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
So just use the law of large numbers

2455
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Then use the formula of total probability

2456
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
that's all

2457
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
so

2458
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Actually I feel like

2459
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
as if he could

2460
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
past database

2461
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
When improving operational efficiency

2462
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
It's all about hardware or

2463
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
write programs to improve

2464
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
But today I heard full of special thoughts saying

2465
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
He can use some statistical theorems

2466
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Then to improve his computing efficiency

2467
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Thank you, teacher

2468
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Okay, let's talk in private, yeah

2469
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:09,000
And here are two more. The last two.

2470
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Hello teacher, may I ask

2471
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Although the EM algorithm can improve the maximization of our target cold accommodation

2472
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
with optimization, but it sometimes has its drawbacks

2473
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
The calculation is complex and the convergence rate is relatively slow, and it will depend on the cold weather of the initial parameters

2474
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
For reference, the part in E-STEP will not affect us

2475
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
The strength of the interval so far, thank you

2476
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:37,000
What you just said is absolutely correct, that is, the E-EM algorithm has a

2477
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
There are some disadvantages, for example, the biggest disadvantage is its

2478
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
The operation speed is slower because

2479
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Right, because it's an algorithm we call linear

2480
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
it is slower

2481
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
But what you just said is that

2482
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:01,000
E-EM algorithm

2483
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,020
your final question is

2484
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:07,020
That is to say, we have to rely on his initial parameters

2485
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,020
make assumptions

2486
01:56:08,020 --> 01:56:10,000
Will this affect our ability to get

2487
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,020
The strength of the newcomer interval

2488
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:13,020
yes yes yes you mentioned the new range

2489
01:56:13,020 --> 01:56:15,020
What about the new range?

2490
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:17,020
I don't think it matters, that is to say

2491
01:56:17,020 --> 01:56:20,020
If once you're sure he's

2492
01:56:20,020 --> 01:56:22,020
Convergent at last

2493
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:26,020
Then finally you can use

2494
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:28,020
We have this formula

2495
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:31,040
We have this certain formula

2496
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,040
It can be used to calculate his newcomer range

2497
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,040
so there is no problem

2498
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,040
right

2499
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,040
should be

2500
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,040
right

2501
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,040
I know this video will be there

2502
01:56:56,060 --> 01:56:59,060
PTT if the teacher is willing

2503
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:00,060
The Folklore Department should be able to

2504
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
can handle

2505
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:03,600
nod over there

2506
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:04,600
good

2507
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,600
no problem

2508
01:57:05,600 --> 01:57:06,400
no problem

2509
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,100
Well, if we have

2510
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:12,100
Send out all the magazines

2511
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:15,600
before ending today's speech

2512
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:19,100
I want to make a preview before the event

2513
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,600
Our next month is May

2514
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:24,200
The Feast of Knowledge is on May 29th

2515
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,900
by our Institute of Biochemistry

2516
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,900
This topic is completely different

2517
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:33,000
Is Wu Shixiong Distinguished Researcher

2518
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,100
So here in the life sciences group

2519
01:57:35,300 --> 01:57:37,300
The topic of his lecture is

2520
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:41,200
The relationship between sugar molecules and life

2521
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:44,000
So this is from our life science group

2522
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,100
a speech

2523
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:49,300
Here we would like to thank our keynote speaker today

2524
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,100
Teacher Chen

2525
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,100
Teacher Chen Yihao

2526
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:52,600
Thanks

2527
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:53,600
give us a

2528
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,000
thank you all

2529
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:56,400
yes

2530
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:57,900
very special speech

2531
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,600
Then thank you all the guests

2532
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,100
again

2533
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,500
We hope to see you all again next month

2534
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:04,500
Okay, thank you
