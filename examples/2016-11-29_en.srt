1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
move.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,080
We are currently at dioxide research committee.

3
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,120
The TWA will start learning how to use the flooding to sec naive in stepping up a practicalicked recharge.

4
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,100
Hello everyone

5
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,560
Welcome to one breakfast

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,840
I want to represent our Vice President Huang Jingxin first.

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,760
thank you all

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,000
Because he was supposed to host

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,600
he is a little unwell

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,800
So I'm temporarily assigned to host

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,240
Again, I want to remind everyone that

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,640
from the last speech

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,480
Our present feast of knowledge

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Live broadcast every time

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,800
webcast

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,280
So if it is not convenient for you to come to the scene in the future

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,520
You can watch it at home or online

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,480
I hope you can tell your friends

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,160
I also hope that more people

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,520
able to take advantage of such opportunities

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,360
Come enjoy some of our great presentations

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,920
Then I will make an announcement

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm afraid I'll forget it later

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
next month

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,760
Feast of Knowledge in December

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,760
by this of our hospital

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,240
History and Institute

28
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,920
Ten Signs of Fortune

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,160
speak for us

30
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,200
images of historical memory

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,080
From Digital Three Kingdoms to Dongpo

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have stabbing arms

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hope everyone can come to participate next time

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Today I am very happy to have this opportunity to introduce my old colleagues

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mr. Chen Yizhuang, an old colleague of more than 20 years

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Dr. Yizhuang Chen is in our Institute of Biomedical Sciences

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He is a graduate of National Taiwan University Department of Agrochemistry

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then I went to Massachusetts Zhouli University in the United States to study for a Ph.D.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It only took four years

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then went to Harvard University as a postdoctoral fellow

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
only took two years

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Then I returned to Taiwan to join the Biomedical Institute

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Then his research at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences has always been related to neurodegeneration and drug development

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Then today we can hear his wonderful speech in this regard

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
His research has been outstanding

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
so he won many awards

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He was selected as one of our top ten outstanding young women

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Top Ten Lifted Youth

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Won the Academia Sinica Young Researcher's Writing Award

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Won the dismissal award from the National Science Council of the Executive Yuan three times

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you graduate three times, you can't get it again.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
As a special researcher of the Ministry of Science and Technology

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then I got Dr. Du Congming's commemorative speech

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Li Tiande Medical Science and Technology Award

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
a lot of

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
In addition to his academic research

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He has also done a lot of service to our academic community

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Then he served in the National Science Council

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Anxious person for medical students and chemists

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Served as the deputy director of the Biomedical Institute

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
is now part of our Basic Neuroscience Society

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
secretary general

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Recently invited to register by our new asylum director

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,960
Because the director of the International Affairs Office of our school headquarters

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,600
So he's doing a lot of service work

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,060
He is going to tell us a very interesting topic today

67
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,760
Let’s talk about our miracle doctor system

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
There is a very special cell

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,960
I asked him to introduce his

70
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,560
please welcome

71
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,760
Goodnight everybody

72
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,020
I want to thank you all

73
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,220
Although there is a live broadcast, you are still here

74
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,420
so i thank you very much

75
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,960
Today I would first like to thank our grandson Mi for introducing me

76
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,260
He not only introduced me on behalf of the vice president

77
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,360
and probably many of you here know

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,560
He is also a neuroscience researcher

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,660
So today if we have any questions

80
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,360
it's too difficult for us to discuss

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,020
I want to ask my grandson Mi to leave the hospital

82
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,320
I would also like to thank our colleagues in Academia Sinica

83
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,360
Assisted me in many preparations

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,020
very happy

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
What's super interesting today is

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Some people from my lab also came

87
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,200
I want to talk about them on this point

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,400
is our lab where we do this type of research

89
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,100
Not just a teacher

90
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,800
we need some young scholars

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,300
work hard with us

92
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,900
So what I'm talking about today

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
wait a minute there will be an online

94
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,500
I have a summary to share with you

95
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,900
I should also mention that

96
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,200
Today's prepared materials

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,600
I try to translate most of it into Chinese

98
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,100
because we cherish the opportunity

99
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,700
We can share our

100
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,200
How we think about something and how we do it

101
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,100
that also needs everyone

102
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,800
Just give us some of your opinions and suggestions

103
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,100
How many new slides are there?

104
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,800
What's new is the slideshow.

105
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Because of the relationship of time it is very close

106
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,300
so it's basically in english

107
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,800
But it's not for you, it's for me

108
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,900
it's my super

109
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,500
So please include

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay, before I start, I would like to thank the artist from the Biomedical Institute of our Academia Sinica

111
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,920
Many of our referrals today are handled with their assistance

112
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Basically, Academia Sinica is a place that attaches great importance to cooperation

113
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,720
We need everyone's joint efforts in many things

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,200
You should have read this matter many times in the newspapers, right?

115
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,520
We are now an aging society

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,120
In an aging society

117
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,520
That's the next year

118
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,520
At that time, 14% of our compatriots over the age of 65

119
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,920
Well, wait until the year I retire

120
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,320
we will have

121
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,520
We are a super-aged society

122
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,120
This is 20% 20% 20% 20%

123
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,120
So everyone can understand why we are in the newspaper

124
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,920
often see long photos

125
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,520
often see how to take care of our family

126
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
this is because

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The elderly population will have multiple chronic diseases

128
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Here is an interesting article from the Legislative Yuan

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,900
This is what I wanted to say when I watched it four years ago

130
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,800
wow the legislature is really good to us

131
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
because they wrote a

132
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,500
That is, they wrote an article saying

133
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,000
take a look at

134
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,600
This article is from the 101st year of the Republic of China

135
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,000
They announced it four years ago

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,700
say 40 years later

137
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,400
That is, 30 years from now

138
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,600
The number of people with dementia will exceed 720,000

139
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
After that, it was more serious

140
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,300
because everyone has a family

141
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,700
So it affects our population of 23 million

142
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,600
inside it may affect

143
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
maybe a quarter to a fifth

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
this is very very serious

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
So what about our Legislative Yuan?

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
They instruct the Executive Yuan

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,900
what are you doing

148
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,100
They said that the Executive Yuan should instruct the National Science Council

149
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,200
as now

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
The Ministry of Science and Technology also cooperates with Academia Sinica to develop

151
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,920
Antibodies and Drugs for Improving Institutional Syndrome

152
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,960
four years ago they said so

153
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,640
Many of our colleagues work hard to do this

154
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,960
in various fields

155
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,400
But these four years

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,440
it's not an easy thing

157
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,200
the whole world is like this

158
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,800
I'll share it with you later

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Our observations on these things

160
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I should mention it first

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
what if in this situation

162
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
We also saw in the report

163
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Some of our long-term care facilities will start to emerge

164
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Our Ministry of Science and Technology also led some

165
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Brain science-based research projects

166
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,200
So actually we all work very hard

167
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
The whole world is working hard

168
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
This one is my little tide

169
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
when did this happen

170
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
happened last week

171
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
what's the matter

172
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
There is a biotech company in the United States

173
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
he has an antibody

174
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
This antibody does a lot of things

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,040
How long? 27 years

176
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,240
This antibody is curative

177
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,360
What about the usage of this antibody?

178
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,400
every month you go to the hospital

179
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
and you let it into your blood

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,200
once

181
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,760
Then everyone thinks it might cure the cure

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,800
Didn't expect it to be last week

183
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,240
It proves that it cannot support

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
Can't heal the disease?

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,640
able to slow down

186
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,960
so you can predict what will happen

187
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,640
what happened

188
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,560
Everyone is very sad

189
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,440
Especially some professors of the Cultivation Society

190
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,760
because they are full of expectations

191
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,560
Think about it in 27 years

192
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Another thing is the stock market crash

193
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,480
Yes or no

194
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,760
The company's stock fell 10%

195
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,160
also cut flowers

196
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,000
Other stocks also adjusted on that day

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,160
So express how disappointed everyone is

198
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,880
that's it

199
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,200
You see this topic is very interesting

200
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,400
it title it says

201
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,040
but oh

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,440
The treatment of this substantial disease is still in progress

203
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
That is to say, everyone did not give up their efforts.

204
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
But he is really difficult

205
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
This person is also famous

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This man's name is Daley Baltimore

207
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
He once won the Nobel Prize in 1975

208
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
He was only 38 years old

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
he is very very powerful

210
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Served as president of several American universities

211
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,960
He is almost like a Taiwanese theorist

212
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,800
He has contributed to the development of various important academic

213
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,920
both make suggestions

214
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,920
He wrote an article earlier this year

215
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,520
because we all see

216
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,480
studying neurological diseases

217
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,600
How much effort is needed on this matter

218
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Then I think many colleagues here

219
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,320
maybe less

220
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,040
The United States has spent a lot of money in recent years

221
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,440
to do research on the brain

222
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,760
So he stood up and spoke

223
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,560
some very important words

224
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,000
He said everyone felt

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It seems that we should start doing applications or should start doing basics

226
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Maybe there are two ideas, right?

227
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,200
I should have reported to everyone first

228
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,000
The slice I prepared today

229
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The file is almost an hour

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,200
But because of knowledge and thinking, the most important thing for us is to be able to share our ideas with you.

231
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,800
There are all kinds of questions

232
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,200
So you are welcome to interrupt me at any time and you can follow me

233
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,800
we can discuss some issues you are welcome

234
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,600
We have discussed this concept

235
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
In the final analysis, should research be applied or basic?

236
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,600
Then this old Qi, a very important scholar

237
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,800
He is 79 years old this year

238
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,400
Everyone knows I don't know everyone here

239
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Do you think your chances of getting Shi Zhi's disease are high?

240
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,600
So everyone is a confident person

241
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Why? If you live to be over 85

242
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,000
chance is half

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So in other words, only compatriots with very long lives have the chance

244
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
usually

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
so

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
then we also hope

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
if everyone works hard

248
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
maybe by the time you're 85

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
maybe we've found a way

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This is of course the goal

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
yes

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
at last

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Finally one of my slices is working together

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
All right

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's talk about this at the end

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
this important scholar

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He said

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
why do we have so much difficulty

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
because

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We don't know enough about the basics

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What we know about the nervous system

262
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
understanding of nerve cells

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
need to go further

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Then my grandson didn't mention it just now

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I have been in the past ten years

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
took some effort to make medicine

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I must reflect very sincerely

268
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
we often

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Dilemmas in Drug Development

271
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
because we don't know enough about biology

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
so here

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
our great

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
this very important scholar

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He made a point that I admire

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He said

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,600
Did you say how to work hard?

278
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,720
I think his suggestions can be very useful for your reference.

279
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,320
This is the suggestion of scholars

280
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,920
but wait a minute some are

281
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
It may have something to do with us personally

282
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
we'll come back to this part

283
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
this he mentioned

284
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,360
All scholars must keep their eyes open

285
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,520
Talk to you about people from different fields

286
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,360
Let's see if there is any new technological development

287
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,800
Because why do we have so much trouble

288
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,120
It's because the technology may not be there yet

289
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,640
So the first one he thought said

290
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,160
Should be very active technological development

291
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,600
new technology

292
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,560
The second point he said that our data should be shared

293
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,440
Yes or no

294
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,800
i know i'm gonna tell you

295
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,560
you have to tell me

296
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,400
We can reduce a lot of problems

297
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,800
when knowledge is shared

298
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,680
Is there any way to make it more efficient

299
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,720
then easier

300
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,400
So it's not just us who do neuroscience

301
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,560
In fact, people in the technology industry and people in the information industry

302
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
these friends

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
should all come in together

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
again that is to say

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Basic science is very, very important

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
we must know more

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Of course, he also talked about it in this

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Of course clinical trials should be better designed

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then what

310
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Maybe we have to take a long look at the above and work hard

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and develop new drugs

312
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
so this is his personal opinion

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But it is important that he mentioned

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He said it takes effort

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's everyone working together

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But his starting point must be basic research

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I have no idea

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know if everyone will sit

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
in your seat

320
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
you're actually a little disappointed

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
because you wish

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
there is a medicine soon

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
then

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
well like this

325
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
that's what I wish I was

326
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
By the age of 85

327
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
there are already such drugs

328
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Then of course we are working hard in this direction

329
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But we still have to tell you

330
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He still needs basic research

331
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Further research

332
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
then we will work together

333
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,100
The reason for this is actually just to mention that

334
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,340
we need to know more

335
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,120
If we have some young classmates here

336
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,360
young researcher

337
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,520
no matter what field you are in

338
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,160
we all need you

339
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
especially the nervous system of the brain

340
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,360
And the thing about brain cells

341
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,200
So today I want to share with you a few topics

342
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,920
one is a brain cell

343
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,480
a nerve cell

344
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,680
Because this may be less heard by everyone in the past

345
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,720
The last point is that I want to share with you

346
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,040
We are not just me in Academia Sinica

347
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,920
And we have several related laboratories

348
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,720
How do we study related issues

349
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,800
some if too thin

350
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,200
We look at the relationship between time

351
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
probably won't go into details

352
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,320
I think this may have something to do with everyone's interest

353
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,040
So mainly these three parts

354
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,480
brain cells i believe in here

355
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,640
Everyone will always come to listen to the knowledge test

356
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,640
must be very very normal

357
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,240
read for a long time

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
a person with a lot of books a person with a lot of interest

359
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So you should all know what a brain cell is

360
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Everyone knows the brain. Someone knew it a long time ago.

361
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What is the front page and the back page of the brain responsible for?

362
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
For example, the cerebellum is here. The cerebellum is responsible for the coordination of movements.

363
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Let's say our memory is the hippocampus, right?

364
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If we read a lot of popular science, we will see the hippocampus

365
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We know the hippocampus should be somewhere in the middle of this

366
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What about the hippocampus, if there is some protein in it

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
If it accumulates abnormally, its function will become bad

368
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So this is common knowledge

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I also want to remind you that it is in my information this time.

370
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I put my relevant acknowledgments and references here

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In fact, there is a lot of useful information on the Internet

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But if you are interested, you can look further

373
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We are in a very good time right now

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why? Because the whole world is working on this part.

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Almost never in human history

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,760
What is known about the nervous system so far

377
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,040
For example, we see that this is a

378
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,960
Brain look

379
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,240
But in fact, the connection and network we just talked about

380
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,040
Already have good

381
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,040
sorry

382
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
Many people are already doing it

383
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,960
So from one area of ​​the brain to the next

384
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,640
In fact, many people are studying

385
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,240
those studies

386
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,440
research?

387
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,800
it basically gets thinner

388
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,960
For example, to tell you

389
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,360
There's a place that might be about fear

390
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,520
then can you

391
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
something bad happened to you

392
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,480
take a medicine quickly

393
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,800
Inhibit the cranial nerves in that place

394
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,240
then you don't remember the bad things

395
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,840
That's not bad, isn't it?

396
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,560
It's a post-traumatic memory

397
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,560
So someone is actually thinking about this

398
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,960
then i used to be

399
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,960
In a seminar abroad, I saw someone researching

400
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
Where is the brain area of ​​successful people?

401
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,800
They can decide that two mice collide

402
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,840
Then what

403
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,560
successful rats will squeeze you out

404
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,320
Then if it finds this area

405
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,920
It uses electromagnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic

406
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
stimulate the area

407
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,720
Originally a very playful mouse

408
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
will push you out now

409
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,440
So the study of brain regions will provide us with a lot of insight into the nervous system

410
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,760
this is scary

411
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,400
You will want to say that when my son takes the exam

412
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,600
I told him to get stimulated

413
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,000
He might become very aggressive

414
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,560
But there are many ethical norms in scientific research

415
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,320
So the more you know

416
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,520
It is likely that our specification will become clearer in the future

417
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,360
Brain Cells

418
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,680
I would like to introduce to you how many types of brain cells there are

419
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Then what

420
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,800
let's look at one

421
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,960
Interrelation diagram between them

422
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,920
You may be able to understand these things more clearly

423
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,560
what is the relative relationship

424
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,360
Everyone knows that nerve cells are the most important, right?

425
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,480
It connects one area to another

426
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,400
Here when the nerves are active

427
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,960
There will be many potentials going through

428
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,200
The faster you pass it on, the more effective it will be

429
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,840
But it can't be too fast, too fast will cause problems

430
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,120
That looks like a wire, right?

431
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,800
You want this wire to pass well

432
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Then there are many friends here who must be good at collecting wires or machines

433
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,920
You'll know what must be on the outside of this wire

434
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,600
It's safe to wrap it up, right?

435
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
So there is a wrapped thing that is

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,400
Oligodendrocyte

437
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,400
It's called Saltu Gelge cells and it's specially wrapped

438
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Each cell contains 50 nerve cells

439
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,400
The purpose is to make it incompatible with each other

440
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Electric shock?

441
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
it's just a short circuit thank you

442
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
will not short circuit

443
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
everyone knows that

444
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
have a serious illness

445
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Rozum's oil is not

446
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
That is its water warp

447
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
right

448
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
It's the water warping that's the problem

449
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
And when there is no such water warping

450
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400
It reduces the entire nerve conduction by 30 times

451
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
so is very

452
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
such a serious problem

453
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What else? Glial cells

454
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What is this cell? This cell is super important

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
they are all brains

456
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
you can look inside your head

457
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
85% are these cells

458
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
glial cells

459
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Is it big enough, you can see its relative relationship

460
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But if you look carefully

461
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
you will find

462
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It is afraid of medicinal essence, why?

463
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Because one of its feet is with the blue color of nerve cells

464
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's attached to the other foot? The red one

465
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Blood vessel

466
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So can anyone guess what it is used for?

467
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Right, nutrition, support, nerve cells

468
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
so

469
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Who is the most important person in Academia Sinica?

470
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
dean

471
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The most important thing about Academia Sinica is a group of

472
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
one horde one horde

473
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Researchers

474
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
support us dean

475
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
glial cells

476
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,600
Cells are our basic researchers

477
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
It's them

478
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,520
they do a lot of work

479
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,520
In a moment I will give you two

480
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Blood vessels are of course important

481
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
There is still one

482
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
Just keep looking over here

483
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,020
You see it's actually on the blood vessel

484
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
it covers the blood vessels

485
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
It also coats nerve cells

486
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
the blue part

487
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
ok

488
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,720
now everyone starts to see

489
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Microfocus cells

490
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,220
this cell is small

491
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,740
About 5-10% of this

492
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
when is it serious

493
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
when the brain starts

494
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,740
infected

495
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,740
less common

496
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,740
degenerate

497
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I don't know if you have elders

498
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
at home

499
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
that is

500
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,240
Originally good minded and close to the people

501
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
everything is very good

502
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,740
fell down one day

503
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,740
or one day

504
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
caught a cold

505
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
in and out of the hospital

506
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Sanity also begins to degenerate

507
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,740
Then it got serious

508
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
This is what we call an immune response

509
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
is very very serious

510
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
so this is

511
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Microfocus cells

512
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
caused by vitreous cells

513
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Our Academia Sinica also has some research colleagues

514
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's for vascular cells and immune response

515
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you are interested in the future

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You can respond to our Academia Sinica

517
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
they can be invited to speak

518
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Many drugs are now

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
for vascular cells

520
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Then after I finish speaking

521
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
please remember the color

522
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Let's start by showing a section of their specific appearance

523
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Okay, it's also a cartoon picture

524
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
But you can see how they relate to each other

525
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
what is the relationship

526
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
This is the nerve cell we see

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
many nerve cells

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
they are connected in a string

529
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
usually a whole string

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Then here comes ours

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
covered with wires

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The outside is wrapped

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Advantageous power pole blockage

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It protects the conduction of nerve cells

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It is effective

536
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,920
You can see that they are

537
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,600
parts of these conduction potentials very closely

538
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
all covered

539
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,720
So in many neurodegenerations

540
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,240
This section will see

541
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,400
It can be serious if its volume is reduced

542
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,640
The appearance of white is our protagonist today to encircle and suppress cells

543
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,800
part of it is on the nerve

544
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,960
You can see that it's wrapped around the nerves

545
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,760
it also links part of

546
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,960
what we just talked about

547
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,360
Oligodendrocyl

548
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,960
it's a lot

549
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,440
We just said that there are 80

550
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,960
80 to 85 scale

551
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,120
blood vessels appear

552
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,560
Blood vessels are in this combination

553
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,160
So there is an angle that is

554
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
glial cells

555
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,760
There is a horn that rests on the blood vessel

556
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,080
The other corner is connected to the top of the nerve cell

557
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,800
that form a very, very close one

558
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
In short

559
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,640
Normally, if nothing happens, these glial cells

560
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,320
will form a structure in the brain

561
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
So your brain is very stable

562
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,000
is very safe

563
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,080
At the same time, there are some perigelatin cells shuttling inside

564
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,080
They're kind of like cops inside their heads.

565
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,240
When something is wrong, he will show up to solve some problems

566
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,640
they are small

567
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,080
But when he sees something wrong, he will put

568
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
he swallows or breaks him down

569
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
His role is mainly

570
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,400
It's just a group of cells

571
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,560
functional neurons

572
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
but we are sitting here now

573
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,840
The inner cortex of our brain

574
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,840
For example, we have a lot of neurons

575
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,120
Then what

576
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,440
Have you ever thought about

577
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,440
He still wants some fluid to flow through, doesn't he?

578
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,040
Our nerve cells are like us

579
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
we want to eat we want to drink what more do we need

580
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
We have to wait, so we must use the bathroom

581
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So there are some topics here that are specifically

582
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Circulation Brain fluid is dedicated to circulation

583
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
in this part and then do some communication

584
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Wait a minute, let's talk about sleep.

585
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
is related

586
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So in the brain what we see

587
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
you often you may see

588
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
There are layers of brains in popular science, right?

589
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Its real structure is like this

590
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
built up in groups

591
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So just now I would like to introduce to you very simply

592
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
brain nerve cells

593
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Brain cells are not just nerves, there are many cells

594
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Most of the people

595
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
If you could only study one type of cell in your life, what would you study?

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
nerve cells, right?

597
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
it's the protagonist it's the protagonist

598
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You want to be the main character, not the supporting role, right?

599
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So in the past 20 years

600
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Most of the research is on nerve cells

601
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
but it's been a long time

602
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
After a while we found

603
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,560
If neurons we don't know

604
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,400
also very serious

605
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,960
So during the ten years

606
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,840
There are a lot of researches on nerve cells

607
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,240
Huh? Are the nerve cells in your brain healthy?

608
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,640
OK, let's set up our own answers

609
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,040
like i'm over 50 years old

610
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,480
so I'm often very worried about saying

611
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,520
have i stepped into something like this

612
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,840
For example, if you start to forget things, you will be very nervous.

613
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,400
Yes or no?

614
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,760
Neurocytes have two functions

615
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,640
Very important

616
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,560
one is to provide energy

617
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,360
Healthy or not

618
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,400
Don't we humans have a way of speaking?

619
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,960
What is a happy person?

620
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
eat, sleep

621
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,440
What else is there to laugh about?

622
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Huh? It looks like this

623
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,640
So today we're going to talk about nerve cells

624
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,280
has two important functions

625
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,840
under normal conditions

626
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,520
There is a supply of energy

627
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,840
The one I showed you just now

628
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,160
I don't know if everyone has no impression

629
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,840
That was just taken out of the human brain

630
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,040
human brain

631
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,600
The outer layer of red line is the blood vessel

632
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,760
In our body, 20% of our blood goes to the brain

633
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,800
So the brain is very, very important

634
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,340
Blood vessels are very important

635
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,400
Then today because of time

636
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,520
I choose to give you only a very simple conclusion on this point.

637
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,400
Basically, there may be glucose in blood vessels, for example

638
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,760
Then it will mainly go to the nerve cells.

639
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,600
But there's a neurofocus cell in the middle

640
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,840
Strangely, glucose is converted into lactic acid through neurofocus cells

641
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,800
Then it enters the nerve cells and turns into energy

642
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,760
At this time, it supplies many functions in the nerve cells.

643
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,400
I'm sorry, I don't know why I can't see the background in this picture

644
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
But just take my word for it

645
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,160
is that neurofocal cells provide a role for blood vessel

646
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,840
supply energy to nerves

647
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,000
so his health is very important

648
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,040
Then there's one more thing, is it clean?

649
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,080
this point is very important

650
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,640
I don't know if everyone slept well

651
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,200
uncertain

652
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,280
Then when I prepare this speech

653
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,560
After I prepare myself

654
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,580
I'm so scared

655
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,340
because that day

656
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,880
I sleep on a horizontal board

657
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,640
i want to say

658
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,920
so get to sleep

659
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,960
otherwise very serious

660
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,540
let me tell you why

661
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,600
You have to sleep when you are tired, right?

662
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
what's the benefit of sleeping

663
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,400
this is

664
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,740
This is what our ancestors suggested, isn't it?

665
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,780
What is a few meters and a few inches, right?

666
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,600
I don't know if you guys ever tell your kids

667
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,880
or told someone

668
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,400
Tell my kids to go to sleep

669
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,440
he ignores me

670
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480
how many inches

671
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,280
Because of physical strength and intelligence

672
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,080
It is very important to form a good neural network

673
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,640
can form a good memory

674
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,680
everyone remember

675
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,960
joint from one area

676
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
This area is very important, isn't it?

677
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
there will be good

678
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,900
When we just talked about neuroimmunity

679
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,100
have good immunity

680
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
so this is very important

681
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,500
May reduce oxidative stress in the brain

682
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,100
Also slows down metabolism

683
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,400
give you a better rest

684
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,700
But what about me recently

685
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,500
we all know this

686
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,600
why on earth

687
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,300
When I was doing some research in the United States recently

688
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,100
There is a study that I find particularly interesting

689
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,900
So I can share with you

690
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,700
It is also an important function of nerve cells

691
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
this is a blood vessel

692
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,600
please imagine

693
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
this is a blood vessel

694
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
This is a nerve cell

695
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,400
One foot binds nerves for energy

696
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
A foot encases blood vessels

697
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,400
But what about the nerve cells and the blood vessels?

698
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,400
It also has a very thin layer of liquid

699
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,600
a space of

700
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,400
allow brain fluid to flow through

701
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
do you remember

702
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,600
I just said

703
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,100
group of nerves

704
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,300
from the inside

705
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,500
it has brain fluid

706
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,000
flow like this

707
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Then when we thought about it, you said how we arrange it, we knew it.

708
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
How do nerve cells line up?

709
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Then our nerve cells breathe with glucose

710
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
How does it metabolize? Does it also go to the toilet?

711
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
It's just a little bit, and then it goes to the toilet, how does it clean up?

712
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
So this part is actually very interesting

713
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Then there is a brain in the brain called brain muscle randomness

714
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Have you ever heard of the keel water?

715
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Sometimes the doctor you go to the hospital may ask you

716
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You don't want to smoke the keel water like this

717
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Because there are many problems in the brain

718
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It will appear in the brain muscle randomly

719
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What is this? It's interesting.

720
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
it's in the ventricles in the brain

721
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
inside a brain outside

722
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
In fact, you see, our creation of heaven and earth is very mysterious.

723
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Our brains are encased in a layer of fluid, which is safe.

724
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
This fluid is brain muscle random

725
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
we make it from it has a ventricle

726
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
There are some capillaries in the ventricle

727
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's basically our blood that passes through this microvascular cluster

728
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
kind of like a filter

729
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So its composition is very similar to that of blood, except that it has very little protein

730
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
what's the point here

731
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Have you ever thought about the question of queuing?

732
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Now the problem with urination comes, that is, you have blood going in to provide you with nutrients

733
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It's when your, basically your nerve cells expel something bad

734
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Then this bad thing is contained in the small

735
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
That bad protein that causes plaque

736
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
They are secreted by nerve cells

737
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Now is a good time to clean up

738
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So how do we neuroscientists do things like this?

739
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
This is also very interesting

740
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That's in the back of the head, that's the place

741
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
they can be opened

742
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,700
Punch in two different colors

743
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,760
Then, open the skull and put it inside

744
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,440
It's a microscope

745
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,600
Then the activity of the brain can be observed

746
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,280
what's important

747
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,640
it's funny to say

748
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,840
it has two different colors

749
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,040
dye

750
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,360
Let's take a look at this

751
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,640
What about when the red dye is injected?

752
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,520
what time awake

753
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,280
right now we are here we are awake, right?

754
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,560
That

755
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,300
The dye is punched in from the back side

756
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,460
after trying

757
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,900
Look every thirty minutes

758
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,620
it's still here

759
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,100
but if you fall asleep

760
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,860
come and see

761
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,860
It is not in the original place, it will run outside

762
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,060
so what does this mean

763
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,380
Asleep yes thanks

764
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,100
while asleep

765
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,980
all of this

766
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,180
The time and order of this arrangement will be much faster

767
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,660
so

768
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,460
Such a study is

769
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,460
represents many meanings

770
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,440
So they have a concept that is a garbage truck for the brain

771
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,600
The concept is that

772
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,480
Basically in the brain there are also arteries and veins

773
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,680
There's a lot of nerve cells in the middle, and we just saw the nerve worm

774
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,560
Nerve cells expel something bad

775
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,440
When does our brain fluid exchange with hydrocephalus fluid and brain fluid?

776
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:31,920
The amazing thing is that he is exchanging with the small air between the nerve cells and the blood vessels.

777
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,280
what happens when you sleep

778
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,920
The nerve cell becomes smaller

779
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,240
bigger space

780
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,760
So we used the idea of ​​the underground sewer to think if he could get through soon

781
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,920
So this is the result of their research

782
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,760
We can come to the Colossus to fantasize, shall we?

783
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,440
That's what they did later, this team

784
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,560
they made a funny one

785
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,920
Look at the green ones are nerve cells

786
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,040
so you pretend you're neurons

787
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,800
Inside a cell, you can see

788
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Red, of course, this is a blood vessel

789
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,700
This is a glial cell

790
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,300
you look inside

791
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,100
There's a small gap here

792
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,500
This is the space that the brain and machine pass through at will.

793
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,100
It also exchanges with the brain fluid outside

794
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,800
These are the things that make our brains

795
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Sick of these fat intestines

796
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,100
or some small, bad protein

797
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,500
it goes through, it's a vein

798
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,200
it will exchange with this side

799
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,400
and then after flowing out

800
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
to our lymphatics

801
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,600
Lymphatic vessels will come out

802
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,400
Then it goes to the liver to the kidneys

803
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
will be hydrolyzed

804
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,900
so sleep well

805
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,000
I saw this and immediately went back to sleep

806
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,400
really, it's important

807
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,500
I have another one, this video is for everyone to watch

808
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,100
this is sad for me

809
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,000
I feel sad

810
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,200
This mouse is two to three months old

811
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
And then around eight to...

812
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,740
12 year old boy

813
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,600
Are they the same?

814
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,260
That's where they punch in the dye

815
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,900
then 30 minutes later

816
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,160
individual brain slices

817
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,640
see where it is distributed

818
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
And what?

819
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,300
its small

820
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,140
It's the small molecules that move very fast.

821
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,600
it's red

822
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,500
The bigger molecules run slower

823
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,640
it is green

824
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,740
if you see red and yellow

825
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,860
red and green

826
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,000
overlap means it runs as fast

827
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,900
why

828
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,200
These cells are relatively small

829
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,600
Then there is more space

830
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,800
It runs all the way regardless of size

831
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,700
i just told you

832
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,900
my secret how old am i

833
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
let's see this

834
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,500
what about the mouse

835
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,700
is 18 months

836
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,900
almost equal to 72 years old

837
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,700
grandpa or grandma like this

838
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,100
You see it's all the same experiment

839
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,400
Did you see how it ran?

840
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,700
just didn't run

841
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,900
in this way

842
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,200
So age makes a difference

843
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,500
that also explains

844
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,100
Why in neurodegenerative diseases

845
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
often happens

846
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
at an older age

847
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But then I also encouraged myself

848
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,500
I now also encourage everyone

849
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,700
That is to say age is not real age

850
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,200
age is how we take care of ourselves

851
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,500
then we have to exercise

852
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,300
Really, you trust me to exercise

853
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,200
It has a very important impact on nerve peroneal compression disease

854
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,300
If there is a chance, I will tell you later

855
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,900
Evidence from our experiment

856
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,000
Extremely important impact you exercise sleep well

857
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,100
don't be too lucky

858
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
Usually your cranial nerves are more

859
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,500
The system will

860
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It just ages slower

861
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
condition will be better

862
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,500
but what's the point here

863
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,000
that is

864
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,300
there is really a difference in age

865
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,300
Is it good or not? It really makes a difference.

866
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,300
so here

867
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,400
It's just emphasizing on getting a good night's sleep, okay?

868
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,100
then we

869
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,500
just talking

870
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,400
glial cells for

871
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,700
Sufficient energy and cleanliness

872
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,300
has great importance

873
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,500
Do you have some neurological diseases?

874
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,800
We now know from the literature

875
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,900
because of his glial cells

876
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
His following traits change

877
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,560
overactive his nervous system

878
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,840
Instead, many degenerative diseases

879
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,760
So let's talk about degradation

880
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,640
Nakahara-in

881
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,240
I want to talk to you very soon

882
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,000
We are in Zhongyuanyuan

883
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,680
what we do with people

884
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,880
So using mouse models of disease to study neurodegenerative diseases

885
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,640
Do you accept disease mice for research?

886
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,080
May I

887
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,840
When I first debuted

888
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,000
I once heard a friend complain

889
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,720
he just said

890
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,120
He's basically a clinical worker

891
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,800
He said you people are weird

892
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,880
You specialize in studies with flies and mice

893
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,680
flies are fruit flies

894
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,360
And then how to experiment with flies and mice

895
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,000
But basically we wait and see

896
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,600
There are some specific reasons for this

897
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
good

898
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,400
neurodegeneration

899
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,580
I still have to be very

900
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
that is

901
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,940
very heavy to say but so far

902
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,780
There really is no drug available so far

903
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,100
However, many drugs are already undergoing clinical trials

904
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,200
In addition to the degeneration we just talked about

905
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,520
The basic antibody

906
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,900
In addition to no success, there is actually another antibody

907
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,500
It was mentioned in the June issue of Nature this year

908
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,540
Their initial research looks pretty good

909
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,260
So please don't be too heavy

910
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,940
But it's true that we're going to work together

911
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,180
Okay, let's just mention it

912
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,580
These neurodegenerative diseases all have one thing in common

913
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,980
This is a brain slice

914
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,900
that different disease

915
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,140
But we can all see that there are some proteins

916
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,460
piled up in the middle

917
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,620
This is why I said earlier

918
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,020
to shoot

919
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So what do these diseases include?

920
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
including dementia

921
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
including some forms of dysmenorrhea

922
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
including Huntington's disease

923
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Including ship moving

924
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Also includes cerebellar tail

925
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Do you all remember this?

926
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
do you remember this movie

927
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Steel Alice

928
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It's about a very smart scholar

929
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He later changed the course after the early onset dementia

930
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Movies like this make us understand

931
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
is when we meet ourselves or our loved ones

932
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
how to solve

933
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
another famous movie

934
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
do you remember

935
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
take a landscape

936
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
take a landscape

937
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
basically tailing off of the cerebellum

938
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
same question

939
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
different brain cells

940
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
accumulation of different proteins

941
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That

942
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Speaking of No Drugs Available

943
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
If you are a scholar of the Ministry of Science and Technology

944
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Or the words of the head of the Ministry of Science and Technology

945
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
would you like to support

946
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:09,000
There are 720,000 people with Shizhi disease, but we still need to support a rare disease with 2,000 people

947
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
let's talk

948
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
720,000 isn't it?

949
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
We worked so hard for that old man's money, right?

950
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It is true to say so, but it is too difficult for him

951
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
what is the reason

952
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
it's us sitting here

953
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I see everyone looks good

954
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
but we all look different

955
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
we eat different things

956
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
We have a slightly different genetic background

957
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
cause if a disease

958
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
not already genetic

959
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
know what words

960
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
too difficult

961
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
too much money

962
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The 27 years of research just now

963
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
why so many people are sad

964
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
he probably bought a lot of stocks

965
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
he poured money in it

966
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
anything a drug develops

967
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Especially neuroleptics

968
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,600
He must end up with thousands of studies

969
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,160
And a study takes three to five years

970
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,720
a lot of money in it

971
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,480
so this is difficult

972
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,480
what can i do

973
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,880
what can replace it

974
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,600
The flies and mice we just talked about

975
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,040
research model

976
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,960
What research models are available

977
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,280
those research models

978
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,560
if you want to use it

979
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,920
The most effective is

980
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,160
Do you know what its genetic lesion is

981
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,040
there is one more thing to say

982
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,640
Do you know what a genetic disorder is

983
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
But do mice and people really want each other?

984
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,480
how are you going

985
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
my stomach doesn't want to

986
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,720
how do we go

987
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,880
Decide that this model can be used

988
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,840
what can be used

989
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,800
let's share

990
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,240
we are in this field

991
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
how do you do

992
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Wu Yao's availability is as follows

993
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,840
We do rare diseases

994
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,440
i have a very

995
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,120
my senior

996
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,080
Chen Yuanchong wishes that everyone may have heard of his name

997
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,140
He started with the treatment and drug development of rare diseases in China

998
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,440
And then do it really, really well and be famous all over the world

999
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,740
He said something that I will always remember

1000
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:15,360
He said we are a small country but we have a lot of love

1001
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,140
Why?

1002
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,220
When we take money to prop up rare research

1003
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,320
We are helping this group of people we are not helping him

1004
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,360
who help him

1005
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,960
But is a lot of help related to health insurance costs?

1006
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,240
so a lot of money

1007
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,560
But now I want to make another point, which is that

1008
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,620
Although we are very loving

1009
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,960
maybe one thing is also important

1010
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,040
This is a disease of 720,000 people, the big disease

1011
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,820
out of breath

1012
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,640
So you can take a look. There are many big pharmaceutical companies abroad.

1013
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,960
They're all doing it for rare diseases

1014
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,760
there are a few very specific reasons for that

1015
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,080
One is because their basic research is very good

1016
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,900
So there are good animal models

1017
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,800
Many people study, because it is easier to study

1018
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,800
So you know what specific essence

1019
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,800
where do you control it

1020
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,800
it's under your control, so you can research

1021
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
But more important is the following

1022
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,800
How our medicines get into the brain

1023
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Have you ever thought that today there is a good medicine

1024
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,800
how do you get in your head

1025
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
We just saw the blood vessels, right?

1026
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
Blood vessels are a barrier, aren't they?

1027
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
How do you pass this barrier?

1028
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,600
So in Taiwan, in the world

1029
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
There are many studies on

1030
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,600
For example, with that nanoparticle

1031
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
How did you carry it over? Have you heard of it?

1032
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
how to use ultrasound on the head

1033
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,600
had an ultrasound

1034
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
Shake it, open your brain, let the barrier pass

1035
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,600
Let the medicine go in, a lot of people are doing this

1036
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
so apart from

1037
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,600
We are working on this rare time

1038
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,600
We will study how to enter the brain

1039
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Another important point is

1040
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
Taking advantage of this opportunity, we also know

1041
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,600
how to get rid of fast protein

1042
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,900
can we dissolve it soon

1043
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,400
can we get rid of it soon

1044
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,800
These are all brought out when researching the disease

1045
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,000
what about here

1046
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,600
to mention a

1047
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,200
Huntington disease

1048
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Huntington's chorea

1049
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,500
The cause of it is dyskinesia

1050
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,300
dementia mental illness

1051
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,200
Mainly find a fine

1052
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,400
That is, there are three GACs on it

1053
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,600
CAG repeat its repeat

1054
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,200
then everyone just say

1055
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,400
how much is this in taiwan

1056
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,300
about two hundred to two thousand

1057
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
very few

1058
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,100
then why

1059
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,600
you will say strange

1060
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,000
How come you don't know how many

1061
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,400
Do you know why?

1062
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,800
You have this disease, do you want others to know

1063
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,000
don't think so

1064
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,800
So it becomes difficult to investigate rare diseases

1065
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,000
but it's over the world

1066
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,500
has a very important influence

1067
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
Let me tell you about this professor

1068
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,560
let's take a look

1069
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,600
wait a minute we watch the little mouse

1070
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,400
The models we use to study drugs

1071
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,000
Does it really respond to a patient?

1072
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,600
Don't start by introducing the Dr.

1073
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,600
He and his wife have been separated for 40 years

1074
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,400
10 years ago he knew he had Huntington disease

1075
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Then he did a lot of papers

1076
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,800
I also read his paper

1077
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,000
Said they were doing schizophrenia

1078
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
think about a scholar

1079
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,400
when he knew he had the disease

1080
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
what will happen to him

1081
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
he will be depressed

1082
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
must be very very depressed

1083
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,400
Because there is no medicine for this disease

1084
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
But what?

1085
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,800
because he is a scholar

1086
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,400
he knows what research is going on

1087
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
he knows exercise is important

1088
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,800
So for 10 years

1089
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,000
He washes five sesame eggs every day

1090
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,420
The most important thing about this disease is movement disorder

1091
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,960
Let's see what the situation is like

1092
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,240
Wait a minute, let's see the little teacher

1093
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,300
The disease I want to mention is that it is a movement disorder

1094
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,120
we can step back from here today

1095
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,000
i can come over

1096
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,740
I'm very lucky

1097
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,580
Because the part of my brain that is responsible for the organization is very good

1098
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,200
I can wave my hand today

1099
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,540
It's because there is an organization called text

1100
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,760
it's not easy to do

1101
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,260
It is also emphasized here

1102
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,840
In fact, the exercise itself, hard work and perseverance are important

1103
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,460
But to say it again

1104
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,300
I just talked for a long time

1105
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,660
you must want to say

1106
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:38,980
Wow, I talked for a long time about whether mice can be used

1107
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,380
If mice were used for this experiment

1108
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,060
what are we looking at

1109
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,340
what to see

1110
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,060
I developed it to you to dare to use it

1111
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,260
This is a big debate

1112
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,960
there is no standard answer

1113
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,060
but let me tell you

1114
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,620
How do we use this field

1115
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,820
This is a special case

1116
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:00,140
This mouse has a fragment installed on it, which is the patient's

1117
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
small gene fragment

1118
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
ok, then you can see it from the video

1119
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Look at this mouse

1120
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
i don't know if you ever catch a mouse

1121
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
you mistook the mouse

1122
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
it is not happy so it will

1123
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The limbs move around randomly, it is to maintain balance

1124
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
This mouse has no way so when it degenerates

1125
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
it must be holding

1126
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So obviously it clings as it degenerates

1127
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Then this mouse is sick

1128
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Mouse will be a little lighter

1129
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Then let's see how to compare

1130
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
For example, life will be shortened, weight will be lost

1131
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
I have a friend who is

1132
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Dr. Chen Zhongmin, Physician of Chang Gung Hospital

1133
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
He said he one day had a

1134
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
There is a pair, there is a mother with one

1135
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Children in middle school come to see

1136
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
He just told him this kid is weird

1137
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
He's really miserable, assuming he won't

1138
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
not like this

1139
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Just look at him as Honignton disease

1140
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
because he has lost weight

1141
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Later it was discovered

1142
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
His has that bad gene fragment

1143
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
that mouse

1144
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,740
And then there are plaques of this protein

1145
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:07,540
Decreased cognitive function Movement disorders

1146
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,200
So how do we create a mouse

1147
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,240
Convince you that his research is valid

1148
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,940
Here are a few examples, that is

1149
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,440
we try to make it sound like

1150
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,460
Then tell everyone, for example, the old tail said

1151
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,520
Then people can do resonance verification, can mice

1152
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,200
ok so let's see

1153
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,800
can everyone see it? look

1154
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,140
This is a normal person, right? What we are doing today

1155
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,640
Guys, let's do a test, normal people will

1156
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,840
This is a brain thing, I just told everyone

1157
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,680
This brain machine is randomly generated in this place

1158
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,280
Then to protect our whole brain

1159
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,180
Can you see this?

1160
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,180
comparatively large

1161
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,260
So if we go to the doctor

1162
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,960
Our doctor took pictures for us

1163
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,220
He is actually looking at the relevant position of this brain matter.

1164
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,240
abnormal tissue

1165
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,500
Are there any areas of the brain that are particularly atrophied?

1166
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,840
it can be calculated

1167
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,000
What about mice?

1168
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,600
OK

1169
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,400
This is a normal mouse

1170
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,800
look with your eyes

1171
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,200
I saw that the mice with this disease will be bigger

1172
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,600
so same problem

1173
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,800
So the little mouse also has a good chord resonance that can be used

1174
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,500
Look at the state of brain atrophy

1175
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,800
Now there are many brain diseases

1176
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,400
Just use compound resonance to see brain atrophy

1177
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,600
or can mark a certain protein

1178
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,400
let it see the increasing speed

1179
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,400
There is still one

1180
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,300
what we just saw is that

1181
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,000
motor control disorder

1182
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
What about the mouse?

1183
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,400
So this is also a very common

1184
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,800
Everyone sees this scroll wheel

1185
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,800
can you see it

1186
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,400
The rollers are constantly spinning

1187
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,800
If the mouse is well balanced enough, it will stay on it

1188
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,400
So which one do you think will fall?

1189
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,400
i didn't touch that mouse

1190
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Just hold on to that wheel so you won't fall off

1191
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,400
That's not OK

1192
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,000
Because this depends on its balance

1193
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,760
There is a computer technology

1194
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,240
That is, if it falls

1195
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,960
for example this

1196
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,440
it falls

1197
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,240
Let's say technically that it is about a few seconds

1198
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,600
This mouse is the champion

1199
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,000
it just keeps running like this

1200
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
So this is what we use to look at motor coordination

1201
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,640
In contrast we have many lions

1202
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,240
For example, Lions

1203
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,800
See if the mouse can find the target

1204
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,240
And is it going to be tense?

1205
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,280
it will feel helpless

1206
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,400
it will be anxious

1207
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:33,160
This has some analysis to do

1208
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,000
Of course whether we believe it or not is another matter

1209
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,320
Then I introduce one of our

1210
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,600
a friend of mine

1211
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,640
Dr. Zhang Chen

1212
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,080
He told me one day

1213
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,360
we were chatting and he said

1214
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,840
Hey, Yizhuang, let me tell you

1215
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,040
I have new technology recently

1216
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,320
I can look at the blood vessels of mice

1217
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,360
I said yes

1218
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,720
He said bring your mouse and I will do it for you

1219
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,320
OK

1220
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,160
so what

1221
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,080
We started making Huntington's rats

1222
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,880
It looks like we're just having fun, you know

1223
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,500
is what you see

1224
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,880
Are there many blood vessels?

1225
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,680
Their technology can be seen

1226
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:12,000
Blood vessels as large as 50 to 70micrometer

1227
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,500
let's guess

1228
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,000
Is it good or bad to have more blood vessels?

1229
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
not necessarily right

1230
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Some people want to say that you just talked about it

1231
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,500
This blood vessel can supply energy, right?

1232
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,500
So we were confused at first

1233
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,000
If we see something like this

1234
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
what should we do first

1235
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,500
The first thing we should do is prove it with a different technique, right?

1236
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
right

1237
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,500
Don't just use MI

1238
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
MI and holding resonance may just calculate

1239
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,000
so we confirm

1240
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,500
Another thing

1241
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,500
what you might want to know

1242
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,500
what about other cells

1243
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,000
or you might sit there and say

1244
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,500
Mr. Cai, you keep talking

1245
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,500
This is a mouse, okay?

1246
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Does that person have

1247
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yes or no

1248
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So let me show you

1249
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
This is what we just said

1250
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
a large number of blood vessels in the brain

1251
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
we don't know good or bad

1252
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That

1253
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
just had a suggestion

1254
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That means it should look at other cells

1255
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
what is the cause

1256
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Let's ask this first

1257
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
did we just remember

1258
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Doesn't this glial cell just use his?

1259
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Is it important that the foot wraps the blood vessels?

1260
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
blood vessels often secrete

1261
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
endothelial growth factor

1262
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
This promotes angiogenesis

1263
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So we started by saying

1264
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Is it possible that this has something to do with it?

1265
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
if we think so

1266
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
is there any way to do

1267
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The goal is to ask

1268
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Is there something wrong with this glial cell?

1269
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
usually in labs like mine

1270
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
How about such a laboratory?

1271
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
we'll figure it out

1272
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
This is a blood vessel

1273
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
We'll find a way to get this glial cell

1274
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Chuanhua

1275
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,400
We'll chop up the little mouse's brain

1276
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,640
and then dissolve it with appeal

1277
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,840
and drop this cell out

1278
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,800
What about after falling out?

1279
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,120
primary neural glial cells

1280
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,840
Then we can also see some nerve plaques

1281
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,440
really exist in the cells of the disease

1282
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,320
will affect its function

1283
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,160
Let's slice the mouse too

1284
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,040
Let's see if it's because of the growth of the endothelium of the blood vessels.

1285
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,840
abnormally high volume

1286
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,080
So this is our very common research method

1287
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,960
After we slice the cerebellum

1288
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,760
Stain to find out what glial cells look like

1289
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,320
You can see if it actually looks like its real age?

1290
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
it looks bigger

1291
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,080
it is exaggerated

1292
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,520
So it's already overstimulated

1293
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:55,040
and it has a lot of neuroendothelial growth distributed over it so

1294
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,480
So we guess this is the reason

1295
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,200
Do you agree?

1296
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,400
probably no one agrees, right?

1297
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,080
It's that you can't be like a mouse

1298
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,800
I can't be like a mouse, can I?

1299
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,200
So when this problem arises

1300
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,240
Our first thing is to find the brain slices

1301
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,360
I'm going to chime in here

1302
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,400
That is to say we were about ten years ago

1303
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,520
I just want to make brain pants in Taiwan

1304
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,640
because you said to do this

1305
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,800
Then someone has to donate their brains

1306
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,760
So it is very, very difficult in Taiwan so far

1307
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,400
But there are many units abroad

1308
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,920
Including mainland China, it has already started to make brain pants

1309
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,760
Then they collected a lot of patients' brains for slices

1310
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,880
So here I can show you

1311
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,840
That is to say, research units like ours

1312
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:49,040
I will apply for some brain chips

1313
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,520
Then you see that it is actually

1314
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,040
Let's say you want the mosquito brain

1315
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,240
it will appear

1316
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,880
You will apply for this piece with it

1317
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,000
Then you put it in the lab to study

1318
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,860
We dye a protein on the outside of blood vessels

1319
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,500
Then you look with your eyes and you will know that there is actually more quantity here

1320
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,380
So in this way we prove

1321
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:17,040
indeed in the human brain

1322
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,760
Huntington's patient did have more blood vessels

1323
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:26,340
We also found that if his brain slices were used to dye

1324
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,160
All you have to do is watch the green signal

1325
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,200
normal people here

1326
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,740
Here are the sick people

1327
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,240
Indeed, the green signal is much stronger.

1328
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,600
So this is how we analyze

1329
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,400
Could it be related to this

1330
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,000
Could it be related to this neuroendothelial growth factor?

1331
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
seems to be related

1332
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,260
Also is there any way to do this part

1333
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,600
recently one i believe

1334
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,760
Because everyone is out there looking at a lot of things

1335
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,560
must know this right?

1336
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,560
induced pluripotent cells

1337
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,000
This has developed from 10 years ago to the present

1338
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,500
may have a skin

1339
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,100
you have two cc of blood

1340
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,900
Some people even say that it can be in urine

1341
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,400
He can find out the stem cells that belong to you

1342
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,100
and convert it to

1343
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,700
It has to be differentiated in some specific way

1344
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,400
The way of induction will become ips

1345
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,100
Then this becomes your cell

1346
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,200
you can convert it into nerve cells

1347
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,500
Glial cells Kidney cells Heart cells

1348
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,600
This is currently being researched by many people in the Academia Sinica

1349
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,700
All our Bibles do not have Mr. Xie Qinghe

1350
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,900
They just want to build up many people in Taiwan

1351
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,800
relating documents

1352
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,000
So you can do a drug screen later

1353
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
or screening for drug side effects

1354
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So what do we neuroscientists do?

1355
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:48,800
for example

1356
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,000
Yes, there is another very important

1357
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,500
Dr. Hongzhi Guo

1358
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:55,500
He specializes in the differentiation of nerve cells

1359
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,700
Then we also need teamwork

1360
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,800
For example, a few

1361
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,300
We have cooperated for many years

1362
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,500
Basically, if you want to do extremely close related research now

1363
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,500
It must be that the basic colleagues cooperate with the colleagues in the hospital

1364
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,000
In this case we can put

1365
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
There are cells from two normal people and two patients

1366
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,500
differentiate into glial cells

1367
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,000
It also proved that these glial cells have many

1368
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,500
Endoglin

1369
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,000
It is also quantifiable

1370
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
We can see that this quantitative result is indeed more

1371
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Using the mouse model

1372
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,500
using human brain

1373
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Using glial cells differentiated from humans

1374
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,000
can indeed achieve such an effect

1375
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
If we want to study the interaction of two cells

1376
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
We will also use another way

1377
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Here it is said that this is a blood vessel

1378
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
This is a glial cell

1379
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
So we can also make both types of cells

1380
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
attack cells

1381
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,240
keep it in an apparatus like this

1382
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,940
endothelial cells

1383
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,820
Here are the glial cells

1384
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,500
let them interact through small molecules

1385
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,660
Let's see if his glial cells are not normal

1386
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,260
cause excessive growth

1387
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,740
so we can give him a drug

1388
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:23,620
Let him, for example, become colored after entering

1389
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,120
Or with radiation we can quantify

1390
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,220
So it is still quantifiable

1391
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,080
This is the endothelial cell

1392
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,840
Underneath the culture of normal glial cells

1393
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,380
it's that growth

1394
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,840
This is in the state of glial cells in disease

1395
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,080
so it grows fast

1396
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,220
That's why it has many, many blood vessels coming out

1397
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,320
what is that function

1398
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,640
Then this one still has to mention my good friend Zhang Chen

1399
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,720
everyone sit here

1400
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,940
In fact, our blood vessels

1401
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Not just responsible for nutrition

1402
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It also has a very important role in

1403
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,500
For example, if you go into an environment

1404
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,000
Suddenly there are many advantages

1405
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
do you feel uncomfortable sometimes

1406
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,500
what about the mouse what will happen

1407
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,000
this picture is missing

1408
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,500
Don't ask everyone to believe this big picture

1409
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,500
this rat is if you give it

1410
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:27,000
When normal rats are doing this compound resonance experiment,

1411
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
you look at its veins

1412
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
it's here

1413
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
But a normal mouse

1414
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,500
if you give it carbon dioxide

1415
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,000
its blood vessels constrict

1416
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,500
But what about sick mice?

1417
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,500
It has many blood vessels, more than it

1418
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,000
Then it doesn't shrink much

1419
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,500
So it's about blood vessels

1420
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,000
It actually has a function

1421
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,500
it will adapt to the outside environment

1422
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,000
and then adjust the response inside it

1423
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
If wet such an effect

1424
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,500
Maybe it won't work too well

1425
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,500
So we just had a

1426
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,000
is what the audience said

1427
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Blood vessels are not necessarily good or bad

1428
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
how to prove this

1429
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Does it affect physical function?

1430
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,500
We do it very simply

1431
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,000
experiments that a mouse would do

1432
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,500
just open your mind

1433
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,500
Then what

1434
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,500
According to positioning

1435
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
What is the difference between these two?

1436
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,000
This is the location

1437
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
After positioning

1438
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,500
can be very accurate

1439
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,000
For example, today I want to influence

1440
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,500
is the text

1441
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,000
specialized control of motor coordination

1442
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
i count

1443
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
my axis

1444
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
I lay down

1445
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,500
I'll put it in later

1446
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Drugs and or Genetic Tools in the Body

1447
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,500
Take this example as

1448
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
i can hit a virus

1449
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
i affect its environment

1450
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,500
At this time, this disease

1451
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,500
would it be better

1452
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,000
So here is an example

1453
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,000
that is

1454
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
we want lentivirus

1455
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,500
carry an anti-inflammatory gene

1456
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,500
So we found out that

1457
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,000
indeed

1458
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,500
the number of its blood vessels

1459
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
is down

1460
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
And what?

1461
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
its VGF

1462
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
is also downward

1463
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,840
It means that these abnormalities are all due to inflammation

1464
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,640
But more importantly

1465
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,040
This is the movement coordination that we just saw

1466
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,600
It's just how a normal mouse can run without falling

1467
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,840
Diseased mice keep falling with the time of onset

1468
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,640
At this time, if you give it anti-inflammatory

1469
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,800
it can delay the onset

1470
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,040
So this is what we are developing to treat diseases

1471
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,200
certain practices

1472
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,440
Then you can imagine that

1473
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,760
why can

1474
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,400
Why getting drugs into the brain is so important

1475
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,160
because i don't know how you are

1476
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,360
I don't really want to open a hole in my brain

1477
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,560
Then take a medicine every month

1478
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,880
because it's actually difficult

1479
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,560
Of course there are many people now

1480
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,840
Due to the relationship of last resort, this method is being developed

1481
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,840
But this is a lab like ours

1482
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,120
We'll use it to study drugs and

1483
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,040
A method with its pathological mechanism

1484
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,040
so finally

1485
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,840
I'm almost done reporting

1486
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Finally our conclusion is

1487
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,160
That is to say, in this disease

1488
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,600
His neurons secrete too much angiogenin

1489
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:10,360
These blood vessels are actually incompetent

1490
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,360
Well, if we stop this from happening,

1491
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,400
He'll stop voice degeneration

1492
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,880
Everyone sitting here wants to say

1493
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,360
Wow, how do you say this in Taiwanese?

1494
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:23,440
Is public water port communication

1495
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,240
What is the importance of talking for half a day?

1496
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,400
We are developing this while

1497
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,080
We actually don't know if you think

1498
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,760
is he important

1499
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,600
what do we see

1500
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,600
We don't actually want to publish that paper

1501
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,560
Of course we have to publish papers

1502
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,560
otherwise we will be in trouble

1503
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,200
importance has one

1504
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,960
Do you think

1505
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,000
That MRI angiography

1506
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,920
Is it an invasive or non-invasive room

1507
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,280
Does the non-invasive room work?

1508
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:58,240
today if we can use

1509
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,000
This disease can be used if

1510
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,460
Non-invasive chamber to observe disease development

1511
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,960
will it be

1512
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,560
So there are several important

1513
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,640
One is that we just talked about understanding the pathological mechanism

1514
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,960
what we just said

1515
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:14,920
So maybe in the long run

1516
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,820
Maybe look for some inhibitors

1517
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:20,720
new drugs to suppress the mechanism

1518
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,660
Then our lentivirus just now

1519
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,360
it's not good, isn't it?

1520
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,400
because you don't want to punch a hole in your brain

1521
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,640
so not so good

1522
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,980
But if we can find

1523
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:34,280
Drugs that can cross the blood-brain barrier

1524
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,080
maybe solve a problem

1525
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:38,940
So understanding the mechanics has its specific importance

1526
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:43,280
Second, can we find biomarkers?

1527
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,680
This can tell everyone

1528
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,880
This is the part that makes us sad

1529
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,940
you develop a drug

1530
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,440
Then you go talk to the manufacturer

1531
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,740
You said I found a great drug

1532
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,640
He immediately asked you

1533
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,340
when did you work

1534
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,740
when do you want a biomarker

1535
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
tell me a month

1536
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,500
Herein lies the difficulty of neurodegenerative disease

1537
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,500
because of degradation

1538
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,000
even our dearest family

1539
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,500
It takes a while before you know if he's degenerated

1540
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:12,500
Yes or no

1541
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,500
we go to the hospital

1542
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,000
If you have experience

1543
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,500
You know the hospital has complicated

1544
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,500
Cognitive system to tell you

1545
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,000
Have your elders degenerated

1546
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
so

1547
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Is there a good biomarker

1548
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
He's actually a drug developer

1549
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
very important opportunity

1550
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
so this part

1551
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
In the future we also hope to have some

1552
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
good research

1553
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Go in to assist in drug development

1554
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
The third point is also interesting

1555
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I just don't know if I have experience

1556
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
sometimes

1557
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
We will take our mother-in-law to the doctor

1558
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
The doctor said very carefully

1559
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
This old man's drug use is different

1560
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yes or no

1561
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
We just saw some blood vessels

1562
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
It's better if you don't have blood vessels

1563
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
he may be different

1564
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So these vascular diseases

1565
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,400
May cause some metabolic abnormalities

1566
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,840
So there will be a difference in the use of drugs

1567
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,380
We have a very good colleague named Professor Lin Junrong at National Taiwan University

1568
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,400
They later worked with us on a job

1569
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,300
also published a paper on

1570
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,000
on this disease

1571
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,500
In fact, we believe that many diseases are like this

1572
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,400
when the brain is inflamed

1573
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,000
There is a protein in the brain called PGP

1574
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,300
Specially expel drugs out of the blood vessels

1575
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,200
so you thought you ate a

1576
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,400
But actually it pushes you out a bit

1577
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,800
So the amount left in the brain is what matters

1578
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,600
But in this neurodegenerative disease

1579
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,700
Inside our mouse model

1580
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
It is due to the sharp increase in the amount

1581
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,300
change the dosage of the drug

1582
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:49,000
So this is also very important in future use

1583
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
So today I am very happy thank you all for giving me this opportunity

1584
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,100
to report research on glial cells

1585
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,200
Thank you all

1586
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,600
It's not easy for everyone to listen so late

1587
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,240
We feel like we really need to work together

1588
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,760
I hope you can give us some suggestions in the future

1589
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,000
What can we do to tell Academia Sinica

1590
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,880
we will try our best

1591
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,640
thank you all

1592
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,600
Thank you Special Researcher Chen Yizhuang for his speech

1593
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,760
We're now open for questions

1594
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,760
Is there anyone who has a problem?

1595
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,760
please

1596
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,760
ask the professor

1597
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:40,760
They are all researching what medicines will have effective treatment.

1598
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:43,760
Can you give us some

1599
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,760
how to try to prevent

1600
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:48,760
Thanks

1601
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,760
thank you

1602
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,760
I really want to say this

1603
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,760
thank you

1604
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,760
I really want to answer this

1605
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,760
but i'm a little scared

1606
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,760
it's how i do myself

1607
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,440
say hello to you

1608
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,760
because i'm not a doctor

1609
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,040
So I can't really

1610
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,320
make any medical advice

1611
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,060
but i personally

1612
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:09,640
i personally really believe

1613
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,000
Exercise must be good

1614
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,140
Everyone knows that now there is a person called that

1615
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,440
myotrophic factor

1616
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,400
They study very enthusiastically in the United States

1617
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,440
it's you every day

1618
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,680
If you exercise three times a week

1619
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,600
30 minutes each time

1620
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,400
then you hit a heartbeat

1621
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,600
what 130 times

1622
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,000
In fact, your whole body's blood and brain

1623
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,400
Interaction will be better

1624
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,120
There is one called BDNF

1625
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,600
nerve growth factor

1626
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,800
will be more

1627
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,840
they studied

1628
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,840
You know rats go and run for an hour and come back

1629
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,480
analyze it

1630
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,560
It was found that there are more growth factors in the

1631
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,840
I believe it myself

1632
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,560
so i often do sports

1633
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,400
This is a

1634
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,000
sleep well everyone

1635
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,440
I think it's possible

1636
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,760
not too many people want to stay up all night

1637
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,840
That young people please don't stay up late

1638
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,880
Frequent

1639
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,960
It means maintenance should start from young

1640
01:07:58,960 --> 01:07:59,960
sleep well

1641
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,400
Don't use too many drugs or other things that cause high oxidative stress

1642
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,940
professor

1643
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:14,580
Share what exercise you do because you look younger than five or four

1644
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:20,480
There are all kinds of sports in our Central Plains, which is very good.

1645
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,780
Sportscenter

1646
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:26,880
The swimming pool is very good, the treadmill is very good, please pay attention to safety

1647
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:33,020
Treadmills are good because these increase the oxygen levels in the protocol

1648
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:38,400
In fact, the detailed reason for this seems to be not completely clear from recent research.

1649
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,220
So all I can tell you is that I really believe this

1650
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,280
So if you're not fit for running

1651
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,360
like my husband is doing

1652
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:49,160
come study me today

1653
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,740
How about he doesn't like running so he takes a walk

1654
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,580
It's good to walk and swim

1655
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:59,900
Sometimes it doesn't take too long to walk for half an hour

1656
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Actually all pretty good

1657
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I believe this is supposed to work like this

1658
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Thanks

1659
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Excuse me, teacher, I would like to ask you

1660
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
about the beginning of the previous

1661
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You mentioned a story about some nerve-related diseases that come from

1662
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Neuron upstream of it may be too active

1663
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Because it cannot be ruled out later

1664
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
right

1665
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
then i want a little

1666
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I don't know if I can ask the teacher to

1667
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Just a little bit more about what caused the

1668
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Because you just said it was because of CSF

1669
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
It's the one that can't be ruled out.

1670
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
hyperactivation

1671
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
what kind of idea is this

1672
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Thanks

1673
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
thanks for your question

1674
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
In fact, I may have spoken too fast when I spoke just now.

1675
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So I have several things connected together

1676
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
in many neurological diseases

1677
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
what happened was

1678
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
For example, this nerve has been functioning

1679
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Discharge all the time

1680
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That would have been good to discharge

1681
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
i see you

1682
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's good if I send a message

1683
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
But when the news spread for a long time

1684
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
many times

1685
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It causes the cells inside the

1686
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Calcium hyperactivation

1687
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
and then initiates a neuronal death mechanism

1688
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
There could be many reasons for this

1689
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
include

1690
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
For example, some

1691
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
specific genetic inheritance

1692
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
lesion etc.

1693
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Also when we

1694
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
For example, when you are older

1695
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
maybe this

1696
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
When the regulation of calcium ions is not so good

1697
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
also cause these problems

1698
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
receptors between these nerve cells

1699
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I don't even have a chance to talk to you today

1700
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
These also cause big problems

1701
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
However, exclusion of hydrocephalus

1702
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
This thing is supported by the system

1703
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
these are two different things

1704
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
In principle

1705
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
the brain fluid we just talked about

1706
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
just smooth

1707
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Every day we can get 500CC

1708
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Our brains work hard

1709
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
discharge out

1710
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Now everybody sits here like me

1711
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Hydrocephalus fluid up to 120CC in the brain

1712
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
It actually keeps our function

1713
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
As long as it is successfully ruled out

1714
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,700
In fact, the problem is very small

1715
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,400
Now I'm just afraid

1716
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,100
The A-beta we just talked about has some bad proteins

1717
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,300
it just piles up there

1718
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,400
start a little

1719
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,600
Later more and more

1720
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,800
that would cause the lesion we just saw

1721
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:13,600
thank you for asking me

1722
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,400
so i can make it clearer

1723
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,500
Mr. Chen, I have two questions

1724
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,000
The first question is to say

1725
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,300
When the Harrington system is

1726
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,200
There are two of them, one is normal and the other is not normal

1727
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,200
in abnormal times

1728
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,100
its blood vessels grow excessively

1729
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:34,000
Then you have compared the two grown blood vessels

1730
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,200
what's the difference

1731
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,400
This is the first question

1732
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,800
The second question I am very interested in is to say

1733
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,800
D-Geezer at Aceves

1734
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,500
It's Microclean

1735
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,700
usually

1736
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,800
It is incapable of removing those proteins

1737
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:48,700
then why

1738
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:51,500
Cause we know stuff like Marco Farge

1739
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,800
In fact it only knows to clear

1740
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,700
but ask it to clear something

1741
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:59,000
It's actually something else talking to it.

1742
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,840
On this mechanism, what new breakthroughs have been made in the recent research on SAN

1743
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,160
Honorington disease, what is the difference in its blood vessels

1744
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,360
That's what we really want to know

1745
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,760
That's why we do vasoconstriction

1746
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,680
Now it looks like the first of them are neovascularization

1747
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,840
because we can see signs of new blood vessels

1748
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,720
But the blood also passes through

1749
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:33,600
The blood flow is also considered normal, but it does not reflect the environment

1750
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,400
That is to say, if the environment has a lot of carbon dioxide, it cannot react

1751
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,600
So I just didn't say a little bit because I didn't want to make everyone feel super boring

1752
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,480
It is the contraction of blood vessels that requires muscle

1753
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:51,240
It has a cell called parasite

1754
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,160
When those cells are inflamed, they die very quickly

1755
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,320
so those cells die

1756
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,960
So why did I have a

1757
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,840
Anti-inflammation his death was not so serious

1758
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,340
So he can still shrink

1759
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:06,720
So overall we just saw that

1760
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,220
or an inflammatory reaction

1761
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,620
The point you just mentioned is also very important

1762
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:14,420
It is the perigelatin cells in the treatment syndrome

1763
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:17,060
That's because after the loss of perigelatin function

1764
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,660
He can't eat that bad protein

1765
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,720
we just mentioned

1766
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,700
Well, he's actually a little serious

1767
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,800
It is he who releases a large amount of

1768
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,960
satocide

1769
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:31,360
Sorry, I forgot what Satocide is called

1770
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,760
Thanks for cell base

1771
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,560
cell base

1772
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,460
You have heard that during SARS

1773
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,560
Many people die because of what

1774
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,600
It is the Satocide storm

1775
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,560
in the brain too

1776
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,740
You have too many of these cell bases would have been good

1777
01:13:47,740 --> 01:13:49,040
now it's bad

1778
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,400
So we can see that in

1779
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:52,740
nerve pain disease

1780
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,340
Many people are using anti-inflammatory

1781
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:59,940
The goal is to reduce the base of his secreting cells

1782
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,160
So now it looks like trying to reduce the damage to neurons

1783
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,320
Especially we just said that neural network connection

1784
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,320
i connected to you

1785
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,600
Then if I can't connect with you, I don't have this memory

1786
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,320
So this piece is also affected by many of these small

1787
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,200
It is the effect of small plaques of Aβ

1788
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,200
This becomes serious when it can't be cleared

1789
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,200
Thank you

1790
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I ask for advice

1791
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Since sleep is so important

1792
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
As I said just now, there will be some external things to stimulate

1793
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
cause poor sleep

1794
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Can I take sleeping pills?

1795
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Because it's webcast and recorded

1796
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
so i don't

1797
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I am joking

1798
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I dare not answer casually

1799
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
but i can tell you my personal opinion

1800
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
In fact, I just didn't have to imagine

1801
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,760
just afraid of causing this problem

1802
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,400
you know it's fun

1803
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,680
not you asleep

1804
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,200
that your cells will become less

1805
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,240
Then the space will be bigger

1806
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:09,680
it has sleeping pills

1807
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,680
like anesthesia

1808
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:15,040
That is, it will circulate better

1809
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,680
Then why don't you know now

1810
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,160
That study we just saw

1811
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:18,960
very interesting

1812
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,360
It's actually just two or three years of research

1813
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,600
I don't know what the reason is

1814
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,360
So to answer your question

1815
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,280
theoretically possible

1816
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,320
But there's a serious problem behind it sleeping pills

1817
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,440
so really not recommended

1818
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,080
If there is a problem, colleagues

1819
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:36,880
I am not a colleague

1820
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,120
friends who have problems

1821
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,480
I think it's time to talk to the doctor

1822
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:44,320
Finding a way to sleep naturally should be better

1823
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,320
right

1824
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,720
The professor from that country has a question

1825
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:55,160
You just talked about the aging problem in Taiwan

1826
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,680
we have a book club

1827
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,520
are old people

1828
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
There are 20 adults now

1829
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Parents of 8 of them

1830
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
can't rule life

1831
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Some live in nursing homes

1832
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
4 of them are Shi Yizheng

1833
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So this ratio

1834
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Although we are little Wu parents

1835
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
but no specific

1836
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
So anyone can come to this reading club

1837
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
so serious

1838
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
The other 4 people with Shi Yizheng

1839
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
They told us that Shi Yizheng

1840
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
it happened only one night

1841
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Then slowly the progress will be 8 years

1842
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Freed after 8 years

1843
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
nothing left

1844
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
how do you do this

1845
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Why did it happen in one day

1846
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Thanks

1847
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
or i'm not a doctor

1848
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
but still my personal opinion

1849
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
actually not usually

1850
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
one day usually not

1851
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Usually not, sometimes we just

1852
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
And especially I think everyone here falls into this category

1853
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
the smarter you are

1854
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
the higher your education

1855
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It's harder for others to find out

1856
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
we are demented

1857
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Because it will be hidden, right?

1858
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
you can easily find it in other ways

1859
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
suddenly one day

1860
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
there is no way to control

1861
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
But actually the process is slow

1862
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Then we have some very

1863
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
well done research

1864
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
For example that

1865
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
dementia research

1866
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
We combined Beirong's research with their

1867
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
It's not mine, it's Academia Sinica's

1868
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
They discovered that there is actually another one called MCI in the middle.

1869
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
It's just a slight problem with cognitive function.

1870
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
And then they're doing it now and trying to find

1871
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Ability to have problems with cognitive function

1872
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
to real dementia

1873
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Is there a way to turn around in the middle

1874
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
You can turn around there

1875
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
But once you enter dementia

1876
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
maybe

1877
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
current

1878
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
there is no way

1879
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,260
You're not actually a day, definitely not the middle of a day

1880
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:05,420
The middle process is very long

1881
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,700
then we are our good friends

1882
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,920
We can observe ourselves and take care of ourselves

1883
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,460
have some minor symptoms

1884
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,620
Remember to exercise more

1885
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:17,060
I'm still going to say that

1886
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,420
do more of that

1887
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,820
For example, listening to speeches is fine.

1888
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:24,100
But in our problem

1889
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,660
the parents of twenty

1890
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,180
There should be forty parents

1891
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,960
But some earlier

1892
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,460
These peanuts are very old

1893
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,460
But this ratio is also very high

1894
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,160
Are you stable with your acting skills?

1895
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,660
Let's talk about Taiwan's program

1896
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,660
Yeah, actually we just saw

1897
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,160
this is very worrying

1898
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:48,020
That's why I thought I should come in and do some research.

1899
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,160
His proportion will be higher and higher

1900
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,860
especially i want you to know

1901
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,220
That life in Taiwan

1902
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:57,620
Both men and women are approaching eighty

1903
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,740
I'm thinking, maybe when I'm late

1904
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,740
close to eighty

1905
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,800
close to 90%

1906
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:04,720
Half of the people will have this problem

1907
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,640
That's why we really want to strengthen both parts

1908
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,640
one is research

1909
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:13,080
The other one is actually Changzhao and Guanghuai.

1910
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,400
understand the disease

1911
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,400
I think this part will be very important to the whole society in the future

1912
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,160
Thank you very much for bringing it up

1913
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,240
In addition, it means that the treatment of symptoms is actually

1914
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,000
many kinds

1915
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,280
Not certainly

1916
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,440
It doesn't have to be alzheimer disease, there are other kinds

1917
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:29,960
It's hard to tell

1918
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,960
Degeneration is the main reason

1919
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,960
Thank you

1920
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,960
Mr. Chen, let me ask you

1921
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:38,680
sleep problems

1922
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,680
I personally was

1923
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,440
Everyone I think this is commentary

1924
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:43,480
everybody knows

1925
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,880
Some people just don't sleep well

1926
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,920
Does it mean that these people are the so-called

1927
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,440
risk group

1928
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,880
Is there such a tendency

1929
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,880
That is to say, he is easier to get

1930
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,000
because he is old

1931
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,400
Some people with poor sleep quality

1932
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,480
from a young age

1933
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,760
I don't know why, but I just can't sleep well

1934
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,320
that you just mentioned

1935
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,000
Sleeping pills may also help

1936
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,640
then we'll rule it out

1937
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,600
But many people have poor sleep from a young age

1938
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,880
So my question is

1939
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,400
Can these people be classified as dangerous groups?

1940
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,680
Yes, I think there is a high possibility of what you are talking about

1941
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,200
maybe later

1942
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,720
Maybe we in Taiwan should carefully study this matter

1943
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:32,320
Because neurodegeneration usually happens very late

1944
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,720
We are only now starting to build

1945
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,840
For example, the systematic collection

1946
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,200
It's about some things related to restraint syndrome.

1947
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:44,120
BioMarket in blood including brain

1948
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,320
biomarkers and more

1949
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,320
I think the quality of sleep in the future

1950
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,760
Maybe this should be included

1951
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:50,600
Thank you for reminding

1952
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,160
I'm going to talk to my good friend Wang Shujun again.

1953
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,480
thank you

1954
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,200
Professor, you just mentioned that you slept well

1955
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I didn't sleep well when I was young

1956
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
but

1957
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I later because of a change in life

1958
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I sleep less

1959
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Now

1960
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
but i lie down

1961
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
i may fall asleep soon

1962
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
I'm bound to wake up in five or six hours

1963
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,000
that is

1964
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I may not know what's going on among me

1965
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
but i woke up

1966
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I'm probably like this all the time

1967
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
but i slept

1968
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I think I'm strong enough

1969
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
so good

1970
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Sleeping eyebrows are of good quality

1971
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
still sleep

1972
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I just can't sleep long enough

1973
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
but my doctor

1974
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
sometimes my doctor will tell you

1975
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
you need to sleep for eight hours

1976
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
but i can't help it

1977
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
in eight hours

1978
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I actually spent hours

1979
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm awake in bed

1980
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
like this

1981
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Is everyone's situation different?

1982
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
this is the doctor

1983
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
We all hate what doctors say

1984
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
just everyone is different

1985
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But it's actually true

1986
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Do you know about love?

1987
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
only slept for four hours

1988
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
right

1989
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
i have a colleague

1990
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
He's great at the clinic

1991
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
will do anything

1992
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
He also sleeps for four hours

1993
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
post a lot

1994
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So it really depends on the individual situation.

1995
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
then if you think everything is fine

1996
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
you are not sick or what

1997
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
maybe he is the best for you

1998
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I really don't think time is the biggest issue

1999
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
mainly quality

2000
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Like we just said it's no use having a big brain

2001
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
This is to connect like this

2002
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
It should be mentioned that the antibody part comes from the stock market ruling

2003
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
This should be mentioned from the public climate of the central stock market

2004
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
from fat shoulders

2005
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
So how do anti-stockholders who want to fight against stock market?

2006
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
The second type is the fat bladder. The fat bladder is

2007
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
We have limbs with fat arms at the center

2008
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:50,000
like wanton limbs

2009
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
it needs to put its belly on

2010
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
You will pass the stock market stocks on this place

2011
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Why should we look at it?

2012
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,400
yes, that's a very powerful question

2013
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,900
Two questions, one is to say

2014
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:09,400
This can't pass the blood brain, the wall is swollen, what are you playing, right?

2015
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,300
In fact, many people are discussing this part

2016
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,700
There is a saying that everyone knows that

2017
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,400
Are the rows not clean?

2018
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,200
When it is discharged, if your blood goes out

2019
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,200
This big reservoir theory is in the blood

2020
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,400
If you have antibodies, it will help you by the way

2021
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,400
get rid of you is a way of saying

2022
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,600
What are other people doing?

2023
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,400
He put his antibody on top of a can

2024
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,300
A small molecular elite engineered to turn over blood vessels

2025
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:41,400
they think it can be turned over

2026
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:45,000
antibodies in the brain

2027
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,200
Go in and get rid of this plaque

2028
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,200
Like the article in June this year

2029
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,400
I told everyone

2030
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,400
It's so mysterious that they've been doing it for eighteen months

2031
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,000
plaques in their brains

2032
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,900
is lowered

2033
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:59,900
you know we all say

2034
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,320
don't believe it

2035
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,520
Of course the stock price went up again like this

2036
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,520
so

2037
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:06,360
so

2038
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:07,120
I don't know this either

2039
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,360
Because the drug just 27 years ago

2040
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,560
exist

2041
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,760
A year or two ago, everyone thought it would be a success

2042
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,760
so

2043
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:17,000
But there are various people doing various designs

2044
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,760
In the long run I think it will be successful

2045
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,160
it's funny you just asked a question

2046
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:20,760
you say

2047
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,160
Then can I find someone without a blood brain?

2048
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,760
The place where the wall is bulging is fine

2049
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,200
Do you know what medicine?

2050
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,600
Do you have a face and nasal cavity?

2051
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,160
i told you heard

2052
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,320
It's the nasal cavity going up from here

2053
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,120
That

2054
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,680
Put some drugs that are not easy to enter the blood and brain wall

2055
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,760
why not

2056
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,720
just click in

2057
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,560
it goes in

2058
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,120
so now there are some

2059
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,040
Research colleagues are doing this

2060
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,040
that was very successful in mice

2061
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,040
We have a colleague named Dupont County

2062
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,720
Chen Peiyan

2063
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,080
they do things like this

2064
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,080
They click into the small PAPTITE

2065
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:51,680
Then

2066
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,960
the mouse one

2067
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,040
Evidence is much better

2068
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:56,680
but

2069
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,200
you know that mouse has a big nose

2070
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,400
human nose is small

2071
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,600
This is only half a skid why

2072
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,240
Because it's true, the mouse part is very

2073
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:11,740
It's really big. It's the whole head. The person is very small.

2074
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,640
Although the effect is actually everyone is still watching

2075
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:18,440
But there are indeed some medicines that go in this way from this section

2076
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,440
yes very good idea

2077
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:22,940
It looks like a classmate of you has been trying to ask me a question, right?

2078
01:25:22,940 --> 01:25:27,640
I'm sorry, I just want to ask about the sleep just now

2079
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,500
I seem to have seen it in Science Daily before.

2080
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,980
It's not good if you sleep too long

2081
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:39,600
I don't know why that's why sleeping too much happens and is it a good thing

2082
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,940
The second one is for the half of the brain.

2083
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,940
There is another kind of

2084
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:48,240
I just saw another group of medical scientists discussing before

2085
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,440
Sui Pryon's series of diseases

2086
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:52,540
The kind we are generally familiar with

2087
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,240
It's normal like the non-infectious kind

2088
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,940
What is the difference between the lesion in half of the brain?

2089
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
your question now

2090
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Because I was actually discussing the issue just now

2091
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
i was thinking

2092
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I actually read a newspaper that said

2093
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
if you sleep eight hours

2094
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
life gets shorter or something

2095
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
so someone is talking

2096
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Even sleeping too much is not good

2097
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
But what is his detailed mechanism

2098
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I'm actually not quite sure what they are

2099
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
i think they do pop research

2100
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
epidemiological research

2101
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Indeed, I personally don't really believe that it has something to do with the brain.

2102
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
There are other functions of other bodies

2103
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
just mentioned

2104
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Mad Cow Syndrome

2105
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I don’t dare to eat a certain kind of beef casually, do I?

2106
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
That's the Pryon we were talking about

2107
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
This is actually the principle of plaque formation

2108
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Later, people like Shi Zhizheng used this principle

2109
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
So in fact it has some principles that are very similar

2110
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
thank you teacher for your speech

2111
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Excuse me, is that the antibody?

2112
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
What is the role? Is it an anti-inflammatory drug?

2113
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It was also mentioned recently that

2114
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Parenchyma actually has something to do with some inflammation in our brain

2115
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I would like to ask, because the teacher just mentioned that

2116
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Uh, if you inhale the medicine from the nasal cavity

2117
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Then if we use an anti-inflammatory drug inhaled from the nasal cavity

2118
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Could it also be for some inflammation in the brain?

2119
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and then make some improvements

2120
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Then the second question is that

2121
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Uh, it was mentioned that it was during sleep

2122
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
The brain and spine can help us clear the lungs from the brain

2123
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
What about a nap, a Technap

2124
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
a question

2125
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Masquerading as two questions? Yeah?

2126
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
i will forget later you have to remind me

2127
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Just, uh, taking a nap is actually pretty good for me personally.

2128
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Because you imagine it, don't think it's complicated

2129
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Just imagine, it clears the lungs

2130
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
so take a nap every once in a while and make it work

2131
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
I'm actually surprised to say, like we're sitting here, you know you're

2132
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,440
your row you hardly row 95%

2133
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:03,440
You are

2134
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,880
So basically when I take a nap once in a while

2135
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:09,560
In fact, it should be a good effect.

2136
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,280
then we just

2137
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,440
I don't know if it's my classmates who look very young

2138
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,600
i think this

2139
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,000
make me feel so comforted today

2140
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,280
that's why you came

2141
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,000
Talk and interact with everyone

2142
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
because maybe we could exchange some ideas

2143
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,560
nothing wrong nothing wrong

2144
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,440
That is, if there are some anti-inflammatory drugs

2145
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,120
It can enter through the nasal cavity, can it develop?

2146
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,720
We first did another

2147
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,280
is a small protein

2148
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,360
We have also considered the possibility

2149
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,440
I think its biggest difficulty is

2150
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,120
Not difficult. The biggest hesitation is

2151
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:39,920
in the end people

2152
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,320
Because this piece stands very small

2153
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,440
does it work well

2154
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,800
So this I think at present

2155
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,160
not very sure

2156
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,280
but

2157
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,920
Vodin is the evil teeth are very good

2158
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,160
So many people use this aspect

2159
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,880
It's good to have a question just now

2160
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,960
That is to say, is it possible that this antibody

2161
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,800
also anti-inflammatory

2162
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,080
in what we mentioned today

2163
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,500
Instructor, these two antibodies are not anti-inflammatory

2164
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,040
He is scratching the plaque off

2165
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,840
make him clear better

2166
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,720
But what?

2167
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,640
Some Drugs I Know Are Paranormal

2168
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,840
Some people really want to use antibodies to fight inflammation

2169
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,760
If you have participated in the Academia Sinica Hall Award

2170
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,040
will know

2171
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:20,200
They also hope that they can throw in protein

2172
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,760
And then make some essence change out?

2173
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,760
So in fact the biggest difficulty is

2174
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,400
I think it's blood brain

2175
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,400
Obstacles

2176
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,240
there is

2177
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:32,800
is to put protein in

2178
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,600
Or do you need to use a certain virus

2179
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,640
Will the virus cause other problems later on?

2180
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:39,640
in this way

2181
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:49,640
Hello, teacher

2182
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,880
Just looking at some supplementary information

2183
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:53,440
he said that

2184
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,000
It is CHA repeat

2185
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,640
In fact, it seems to be one of his goals in evolution

2186
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,840
that is

2187
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:00,840
like

2188
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,100
like in fact to a certain extent

2189
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:07,840
If he has a high CGP

2190
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:12,120
He's a guy who might get smarter or something

2191
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,880
So I wonder if it will be us humans

2192
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,980
This is an evolutionary trend

2193
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:22,280
is that we may be destined to become like this

2194
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,320
this question is really good

2195
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,920
what he asked was

2196
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,520
Repeat of this CG

2197
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:34,160
Is it really bad to be long?

2198
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,000
Will he be an evolutionary question

2199
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,120
I think what you say makes sense

2200
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,200
Because there is a team in Italy

2201
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,800
just do this

2202
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,660
their conclusion is

2203
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,360
This CGP is related to nerves

2204
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,160
on this gene

2205
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,560
It is very important for the differentiation and development of nerves

2206
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,520
so

2207
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,600
so you know those

2208
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:57,440
because we know some patients

2209
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,740
Honey is really sick

2210
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,980
actually usually

2211
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
These patients are all good-looking

2212
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
smart when young

2213
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
full of energy

2214
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
They even did a real survey

2215
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Find these kids in America

2216
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
before the age of 18

2217
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Their homework follows the rules

2218
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
follow that rule

2219
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
better than average kids

2220
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
but unfortunately he arrived

2221
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
He became ill at the age of forty or fifty

2222
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
so come back

2223
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
i totally agree with what you said

2224
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
just in evolution

2225
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
The length of your fart actually has his purpose

2226
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
But when he gets too out of control

2227
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
he will cause serious problems

2228
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Come

2229
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
host

2230
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Professor Chen

2231
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
grateful

2232
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Professor Chen is very exciting tonight

2233
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
give us that speech

2234
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I join the Sunshine Academy

2235
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
two or three years

2236
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
we are in the middle

2237
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
us

2238
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000

2239
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,600
There are many elderly people here who may be very concerned.

2240
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,600
old sir old brother like me

2241
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,800
My ball will be 80 soon this year

2242
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,400
congratulations congratulations awesome

2243
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,900
I hope the fire gets older

2244
01:32:11,900 --> 01:32:14,900
Han Chuan said that the longer the fire, the more you will get. Come on!

2245
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,300
Ha ha ha ha

2246
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,900
After listening to Professor Chen's original lecture

2247
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,900
We know that

2248
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,900
community of spirits working together

2249
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:24,900
ah

2250
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:27,600
It's hard to understand

2251
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,200
because of U.S

2252
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,200
common wisdom

2253
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,300
Although a large

2254
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,000
hard work

2255
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:34,900
but

2256
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:35,800
Wenmeng Particles

2257
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,600
For example Gan disease

2258
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,900
Gan disease

2259
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,700
also the same

2260
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,400
Gan pregnant until now

2261
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,900
there is no way to overcome

2262
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:44,200
and this heart attack

2263
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,700
no way

2264
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:46,400
and this

2265
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,200
with visceral cancer

2266
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,900
and this

2267
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:51,800
electric man

2268
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:52,800
today

2269
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,900
be honest about this

2270
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:56,600
old nervous disease

2271
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:57,500
like electric man

2272
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,000
Or wear a needle

2273
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Your daughter, we all work together, there is nothing wrong

2274
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I celebrate the new year, in fact, I also announced the new year

2275
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
In other words, I want to be a good person, good intentions will be rewarded, and I can come

2276
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:23,000
We old people want three more times, be happy psychologically, and have a happy new year

2277
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It is very important to be healthy

2278
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Many old people retreated and died soon after

2279
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:35,000
In short, Meng didn't get much, so he hung up. It's a pity.

2280
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:44,000
what should i do

2281
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:51,000
The body must be healthy, and the mood must be relaxed

2282
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Be in a very healthy mood, or there will be more

2283
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
there's nothing we can do here

2284
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
be happy

2285
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
don't be angry all the time

2286
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
besides

2287
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
To be active

2288
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
to move more

2289
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
to move more

2290
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
exercise more

2291
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Swim for an hour every morning

2292
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
half an hour

2293
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
i have worked hard

2294
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Can you get a master?

2295
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
I have no idea

2296
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
be healthy

2297
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
happy heart

2298
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
to overcome

2299
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
our old man is sick

2300
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Le's work hard

2301
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Thank you Pope Chen

2302
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
our great speech

2303
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Thanks

2304
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
I thank you very much

2305
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I start the day by thanking you the most for being here

2306
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And I'm very thankful for today's question

2307
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Because this is one of us all

2308
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
opportunity for discussion

2309
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Our Dean Le recently said something

2310
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
words that touch me personally

2311
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
He said that the researchers of our Central Plains Academy

2312
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
What should be done is long and heavy

2313
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
real

2314
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,400
may contribute

2315
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:04,920
Maybe I still don't contribute much until I retire

2316
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:05,740
but

2317
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:07,640
like you just said

2318
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,360
We can't solve a lot

2319
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:12,280
We haven't resolved what you just mentioned

2320
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,600
but our

2321
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,160
Has life been extended

2322
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:16,920
Have it

2323
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,240
We can handle a lot of ailments now

2324
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:21,000
I personally believe

2325
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,880
Give our research people a little more time

2326
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,640
there is a chance

2327
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,520
And we're not saying wish to live very old

2328
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:30,280
we want to live healthy

2329
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,680
so we'll do it

2330
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,120
I am adding a question

2331
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:37,800
that is

2332
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:44,360
How to keep our old nerves alive and healthy

2333
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:49,080
I need to use my brain more after reading it

2334
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,680
So I can still write tasks

2335
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:51,520
write a report

2336
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,240
no problem

2337
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:53,760
I'm going to keep more

2338
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,040
This Buddha can't rest with one mind

2339
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,520
keep moving

2340
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,280
great

2341
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,040
Thanks

2342
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,840
I think those who are here today, of course you will not get substantive evidence

2343
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:13,580
Thank you, I want to ask a question, and a comment about one thing

2344
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,460
You just mentioned that what is clear is that we have to pass that thing, we have to learn from old obstacles

2345
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:23,560
Then go inside, go into the part of the heart student

2346
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:28,160
When we want to be clear, will he also be sent out from the old barrier

2347
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,200
Sending off after studies, is this the way to go

2348
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:33,800
In that case, he is entering the 0.8 billion

2349
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:37,120
After entering, you still have to pass through the old barrier to get out

2350
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:42,760
No, he is, he has convection, he first convects cerebral fluid and hydrocephalus fluid

2351
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:46,860
Then it went out with 0.8 billion, and after going out

2352
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:49,660
It will be dealt with in other systems that will be upgraded

2353
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,460
So he no longer passes the old age barrier

2354
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,520
In the example we just mentioned, it will not

2355
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,520
ok, ok, ok, understand, thank you

2356
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,080
Then I have another comment, which is aimed at just now

2357
01:36:59,340 --> 01:36:59,980
someone asked

2358
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
sport, sorry, i teach at model university

2359
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I do sports nutrition, wow, great, no

2360
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Then I suggest that now it's about sports

2361
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,000
In animal studies, that is just now

2362
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
You give the mouse the running, the roller

2363
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
They did research and found something like that, the scroll wheel

2364
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
The point is the position of its footsteps

2365
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
There are many sports, each with its own advantages

2366
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
That's like swimming for cardiorespiratory fitness

2367
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
What about running, because gradually hitting the ground

2368
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
This power of this impact

2369
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
or whatever it is , better not run

2370
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and everyone because of knee problems

2371
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
go, go, go

2372
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Then that step by step by accepting the stimulation of the ground

2373
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Then this part will stimulate the real body of your mouse nerve

2374
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
can increase your mouse nerve body

2375
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Can make a lot of tissue that can repair some nerves

2376
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,000
In animal experiments, in human experiments have found some

2377
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:00,000
some time like a professional person

2378
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,940
They stimulated his feet like this

2379
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:03,960
stimulate his feet

2380
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,340
Using this will help his nerves recover

2381
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:08,960
Of course it may not be fully recovered

2382
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,960
But the feet will have this benefit

2383
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,700
Therefore, there are divisions in the heart of sports

2384
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:15,760
have different effects

2385
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:17,040
it does have

2386
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,160
And for osteoporosis each has its own benefits

2387
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,040
provide reference thanks

2388
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:24,800
That palm you just mentioned

2389
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,040
do you want to eat your feet

2390
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,200
eat a foot

2391
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,600
But afraid of contamination, infection and injury

2392
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,640
So wear better shoes

2393
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,000
better protect yourself

2394
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,440
And the tendon walk is not the hand

2395
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:38,440
is this two hands is going to

2396
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:39,440
bring it up

2397
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:40,800
stick to this place

2398
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,040
like this

2399
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,600
To be like this is not to fall like this

2400
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:45,440
so there are some

2401
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,040
And where his feet are

2402
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,040
Step on it like this

2403
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,440
this way is

2404
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:52,840
Just stepped on the heel and foot again like this

2405
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:55,160
So I hope to touch my feet more

2406
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:56,600
Do a little and provide a reference

2407
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,160
Le's work hard

2408
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:00,040
I will take your push in two more months

2409
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,600
So do you feel that you should listen to speeches more in the future, right?

2410
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:07,400
We have so many learned people in our audience

2411
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,200
really good

2412
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,400
ask the professor

2413
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,600
I saw the profile of the host here.

2414
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,200
Research team combines advances in Chinese herbal medicine

2415
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,200
research biopharmaceuticals

2416
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:28,600
Then a new drug adenosic acid was developed to treat neurodegenerative diseases

2417
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,200
In fact, new drugs are already being researched.

2418
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,400
Anyway, it was developed.

2419
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,800
It should have been developed in the past

2420
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,000
I don't know how the progress of this new drug is going.

2421
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:38,600
what is expected

2422
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,600
in development

2423
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,200
middle

2424
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:42,600
That process is so long

2425
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:45,000
The process of a new drug takes about 17 years

2426
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,400
That's because there are many

2427
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:50,000
It's not a matter of science anymore

2428
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,400
So we just hoped for the best

2429
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,000
Let's transfer the notes first

2430
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,200
then we wish to say

2431
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,400
he is in the next stage

2432
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,000
Because there are still many human experiments

2433
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
This is why we also

2434
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Recent efforts to develop biomarkers

2435
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
because there is medicine

2436
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
You are a manufacturer

2437
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
He refused to take medicine for five years

2438
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,000
because he thinks it's too expensive

2439
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
If we find good biomarkers

2440
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
maybe there will be a chance

2441
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
research herbal medicine

2442
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Chinese herbal medicine

2443
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
our drug

2444
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,000
It is found from Chinese herbal medicine

2445
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Then we combine

2446
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Is the professor of National Taiwan University

2447
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
specialized in chemical modifications

2448
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
find new drugs

2449
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
So at the beginning we were

2450
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Talk about Chinese herbal medicine

2451
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Because the older ones often have a lot of wisdom

2452
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
so we came out of there

2453
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
so what i'm talking about

2454
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
This is actually a group of drugs

2455
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
That's what we do from Chinese herbal medicine to synthetic

2456
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
and then to the animal

2457
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
and then in the already present already turned

2458
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
we're going to keep going like this

2459
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Thanks

2460
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Thank you for my speech today

2461
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,000
i want to ask

2462
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Why do our brains

2463
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
why would

2464
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
What is the inflammatory reaction?

2465
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
why on earth

2466
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Then I wondered if research would

2467
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Gradually study that encirclement cell

2468
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Is it because of the inflammation?

2469
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Then I read in the book that there are two types of siege cells

2470
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
what do you mean

2471
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
You mean active and inactive

2472
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I don't know what the two types are

2473
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
in this way

2474
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
right

2475
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
That

2476
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Actually I don't know why it's inflamed

2477
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Because the brain

2478
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
you see we are

2479
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Creation of heaven and earth

2480
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Look how good our brain masks are

2481
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It's actually not very susceptible to external infections

2482
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
except for a few

2483
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
virus or something

2484
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
So it's actually not very infected

2485
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
when you were older

2486
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Infected

2487
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It is inflammation that often occurs

2488
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
that sometimes

2489
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I personally guess

2490
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
It's because it's been used for a long time

2491
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
So some things like

2492
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Not too light

2493
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Or some cells are slowly dying

2494
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
dying nerve cells

2495
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
deactivates encirclement cells

2496
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,600
they become overly inflamed

2497
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,760
Not to mention there are some

2498
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,960
For example, genetic diseases, etc.

2499
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,460
So speeches often follow

2500
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:11,920
is the age

2501
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,860
Aging itself is related

2502
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:17,660
But at present Shi Zhizheng's biggest factor

2503
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:19,520
actually age

2504
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,520
so we really have to take care of ourselves

2505
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,200
don't stay up late talking

2506
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:23,960
yes

2507
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:26,960
ask the teacher

2508
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:33,960
Neurodegeneration including Shi Zhizheng

2509
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,960
in different human societies

2510
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:38,960
Is there such a phenomenon in the human period and society?

2511
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,960
Animals other than humans

2512
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,960
Is it easy to have this kind of neurodegeneration in old age?

2513
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,960
Is his degenerated physiological mechanism the same as that of human beings?

2514
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:51,960
Thanks

2515
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:52,960
Thank you

2516
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,960
I came a while ago with one of my friends and it was Rotation

2517
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:59,960
Just do the content of the short-term training first

2518
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Chat with students in Gilead

2519
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,840
Neurodegeneration has never been studied in their country

2520
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:05,920
why

2521
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,960
They are nervous that their lifespan is 50 years old

2522
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:11,720
no degradation

2523
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,000
Too late to degenerate

2524
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,960
We look at the great heroes of the ancient road

2525
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,040
How old were they all when they died?

2526
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,360
Thirty or forty?

2527
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,720
I read Jin Yong's novels one day and want to say

2528
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,440
Wow

2529
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,000
50 years old

2530
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,600
It's Laoqu

2531
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,320
people from different eras

2532
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,120
rarely like our time

2533
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,560
live so long

2534
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,960
That's why degradation becomes a serious problem

2535
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:35,120
Same situation in the US

2536
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:36,480
they are not as serious as us

2537
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,200
Our childishness and aging and Japan

2538
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:40,200
are serious countries

2539
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:41,080
no america

2540
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,920
But they also saw that when the country

2541
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,160
when the culture is at its peak

2542
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,240
this is becoming a

2543
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:48,560
A situation that has never been encountered before

2544
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,200
That's why this kind of research came out

2545
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:53,240
That

2546
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:55,160
most of the animals i know

2547
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,160
Not as good as class

2548
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,720
It seems that no one has degenerated

2549
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,000
It's our degeneration

2550
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
It seems like even a monkey, right Mr. Chen

2551
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
monkeys are

2552
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,000
monkeys don't degenerate

2553
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,500
So we are using

2554
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,000
When this animal model

2555
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
really very disturbing

2556
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
right

2557
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
if not now

2558
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,500
We thank Mr. Chen today

2559
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,000
very good speech

2560
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Thank you for giving me this opportunity

2561
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
thank you all for coming tonight

2562
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
thank you all
