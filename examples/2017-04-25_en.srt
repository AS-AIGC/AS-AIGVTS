00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:52,580
No copyright repentance

3
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,560
Applause

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,620
I have seen some colleagues in the hospital

5
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,920
and some of our

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,320
former old chief

7
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
And some senior colleagues

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,960
Thank you very much for coming

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,620
Our Information Feast Today

10
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,960
our today

11
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,420
Everyone has information

12
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,360
Our speech today is given by

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,960
You Xiaohua Associate Researcher

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,120
Research Associate at the Institute of Chemistry

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
tell us

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,740
organic bioelectronics

17
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,580
Mainly to talk about electronic components

18
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,280
Combination with biomedicine

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,740
So here I am very briefly

20
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,120
let me introduce

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,240
Our keynote speaker today is Dr. You Xiaohua

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,120
he is from

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,680
Graduated from Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,540
Then to the United States to give birth

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,240
MIT

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,040
Received a doctorate in planning

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
did some

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
After postdoctoral research

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
arrived in singapore

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
senior researcher

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then to Japan

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
their physical and chemical

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
RIKEN's so-called RECOM

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Serve as an independent backbone researcher

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in 2013

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
about 4 years ago

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
just came back

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now working as an associate researcher

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
so very happy for him

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
outside

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
coin

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
after various experiences

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Return to Academia Sinica to serve

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
PhD research expertise

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
is organic materials chemistry

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
high polymer chemistry

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Nanobiotechnology

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
biomaterial interface, etc.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The common denominator here is

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
this is organic stuff

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I think there will be Dr.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
can explain to us

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
there is carbon in it

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,600
So the structures you see have nothing to do with a single carbon

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,200
But his research is now a very emerging direction

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,600
It is the combination of electronic components and biomedicine

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,800
we're going to talk about organic bioelectronics

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,000
These two were a very

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,400
Nor does it mean that in the past in the past, it was a

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Separate and independent fields

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
two separate domains

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,100
But in recent decades

64
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,400
Slowly we know that many things have become a combination of cross-fields

65
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
there will be some new developments

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,900
So in English, you can see that this is Oberonic Power Electronics

67
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,400
so a very emerging field

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not like there's been a lot of research in this area

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,080
Some of the leading positions above

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,640
he has recently

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,200
In last year 2016

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,040
Won our Academy's Young Scholar Research Writing Award

73
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,140
Also won the Mr. Wu Dayou Memorial Award from the Ministry of Science and Technology

74
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,240
This is to reward young researchers

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,200
the most important award

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,840
In the Chinese Chemical Society also took

77
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,920
Contact Seven Chemistry Awards

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,780
Accept the invitation of the Japanese Judiciary Corporation Gaofeng Sub-society

79
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,120
International Young Scientist Award

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,580
behind

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,080
in that year

82
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,280
Before going to college, it used to be

83
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,080
Well, Han Yao Titi used to be

84
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,720
International Olympia gold medal for high school students

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,280
gold medal in chemistry

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,860
So he's doing really well in medical studies and research.

87
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,120
but do the math

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,900
A representative of our young and promising Academia Sinica

89
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,640
but

90
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
His speech today is mainly in this aspect

91
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,440
It is what we have seen in this introduction

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,640
These turned out to be two different fields

93
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,940
Because in the past in electronic components

94
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,280
Let's take a look inside your own iPhone

95
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,840
All those components are inorganic

96
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,720
Because there are many semiconductor

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,320
or other metals

98
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,680
make that link in it

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,340
It's almost an inorganic world

100
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,280
What about organic chemistry?

101
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,140
We know from some of the more traditional areas of the original

102
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,540
Also slowly develop this way

103
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,780
So we probably also heard

104
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,680
in the news or in newspapers and magazines

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,540
I have heard that organic light-emitting diodes

106
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,340
or organic transistor

107
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,840
and organic solar cells

108
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
so in these

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
in electronic components

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,500
also give us a new direction

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,300
So in two very distinct areas like this

112
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
We're going to put it together now

113
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
so today

114
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,800
I don't do too much now

115
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,300
wasting too much of everyone's time

116
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,800
So Dr. Yau will tell us

117
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,700
These two are how we connect

118
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,900
After connecting

119
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,800
it will take us in some new directions

120
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,600
have what

121
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,500
make us feel very hopeful

122
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,900
Then there are some directions for great development in the future

123
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,400
so we welcome our speakers today

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,700
Dr. You Xiuhua

125
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Thank you, Vice President Zhou, for your introduction

126
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,000
I would also like to thank you all for coming here today.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,100
listen to me

128
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,300
Introduce this new field

129
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,500
then i think

130
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,300
Because actually when I was preparing

131
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm actually a little apprehensive

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
because i don't know

133
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,800
there are two things

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,500
that's because

135
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,600
The main international homestay is

136
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,100
Host Dang Er told me this

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,020
speeches can have a wide range

138
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,600
the audience is very wide

139
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,000
In addition, it seems that there is a live broadcast now

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
in this way

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
so i'm not sure who will hear

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
At least my son told me before I went out

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He will watch my live

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So if I'm going to say something he can understand

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
it might be a little hard work

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
my son is ten years old

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But I want to be with today I take this opportunity

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think I'll try to be able to

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hope to understand

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I will introduce this new field

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then I may spend more time on the introduction

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I hope that everyone can understand this field

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
have a little concept

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My premise is that you probably haven't heard of this field

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So if you've heard the field

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
or know something

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
i'm sorry over there

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Because there may be some things for people

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
may be simpler

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But I think in such an information imagination

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I would like to share with you

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Start this series of stories from the beginning

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
that's also very

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Also very grateful to the Central News Bureau

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
let me in 2014

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Able to return to Taiwan to serve

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Then the continuation is

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Serving the country like this

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
then i

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
just

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Vice President Zhou has already mentioned

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that is

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
traditionally speaking

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
naturally

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the greatest one

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What about the creation?

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
that is

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
various creatures

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
all kinds of creatures

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you see it's a creature

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
that human

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Actually humans say

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Truth is the greatest creation

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
in the most recent

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
throughout the 20th century

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The main creation is

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
so-called electronic components

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
These two things are actually

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
On the face of it

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It seems irrelevant

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
because they have many

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
difference in nature

194
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
there are many in

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
especially on scale

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you can know

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
people

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
at least one person is

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
150 cm

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
to 200 cm

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Most of them fall in this range

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
An electronic component is called seven nanometers according to the latest manufacturing process of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It is a whole scale is completely different

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It will have a scale mismatch

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Then from our material point of view

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You can feel that in terms of materials, human beings are a soft substance

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Your body is not a hard gang you are not a steel seat substance

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But most electronic components are made of hard materials

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Contains fine materials containing a wide variety of so-called III-V elements

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There are even materials containing various oxides

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
These are hard materials

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And if we analyze more deeply

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Humans are basically organic matter

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
All wafers are mostly inorganic substances

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The cost of organic matter and its main component is carbon

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and not only carbon

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And the most important thing we talk about in terms of opportunities is

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Carbon composed of co-driving chains

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Promise matter is mainly formed from various accumulations of atoms

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
pile up into a hard material

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
so what

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The two substances are very different in nature

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
then let's think again

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's a question of conductivity

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
everyone knows just

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
recently my son

227
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
i mentioned my son again

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You may hear me mention my son all the time

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Because in fact, I often make metaphors

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then my son just happened to be in the fourth grade of elementary school recently.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Just about to learn electricity

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Just in the fourth grade of elementary school

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Immediately the fourth class will learn electricity

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
because i want to teach him

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
so i know

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So he's just about to learn electricity

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
but the first thing

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We all know that the human body conducts electricity.

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Conductivity of the human body

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But with the conduction of electronic components

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
it's a completely different probability

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The conduction of the human body is a very complex system

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
in comparison

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Conductivity of electronic components

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
nothing but electrons

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
or electric

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,700
Move on the circuit, this I think most people

248
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,700
will have a little bit of basic concepts

249
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,140
electronics or circuits

250
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,100
There is a basic move on the original road with a collective

251
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,400
So, it's two first, the material itself that conducts electricity

252
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
not the same

253
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,900
In this complex system, I will explain in a moment

254
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,500
Let me explain to you in detail, it mainly comes from the transmission of some ions

255
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,300
Include

256
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,800
uh gai ion

257
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Contains false ions , Contains that ion

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,100
And even these have some so-called neurotransmitters

259
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,400
New-On Transmitter

260
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,400
What does acetylcholine contain in these

261
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
substance

262
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
that, the last is

263
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,300
The human body is a dynamic system

264
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,900
The so-called dynamic means

265
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,400
We grow up from small to large, your scale is always getting bigger

266
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,400
None of us are born with such a big scale

267
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
So it's a dynamic system

268
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,900
And then, when you're getting older, you're going to age

269
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,600
So the whole system will also enter a decay state

270
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,000
It includes Agent, including some reasons for aging

271
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
that this

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,440
The chip itself is a very steady state

273
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,860
We make semiconductor components

274
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,780
the most important thing is to say

275
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,700
How many times can you use this semiconductor

276
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,140
how many times can switch

277
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,500
can switch can

278
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,740
how many times can switch

279
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,600
Applicable

280
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,900
how long can your life be

281
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,560
the best

282
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,600
Semiconductor life is infinite

283
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,640
because they encapsulated it

284
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,900
In fact, it can be used for a long time

285
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,100
So these two things are actually different in nature.

286
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,800
then we

287
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,700
But

288
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
certainly

289
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,100
When the wisdom of nature meets the wisdom of man

290
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,300
Finally we want to do one thing

291
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,100
just put it together

292
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,700
that when combined

293
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,600
there will be one

294
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,640
Materially

295
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,200
a difference in material

296
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,500
so how do we tie it together

297
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,300
This is what I want to share with you today

298
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,400
is how to use

299
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,600
so-called organic conductive substances

300
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,300
to make such a combination

301
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,400
certainly

302
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
what will happen in the future

303
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
we are not sure

304
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,400
organic

305
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,000
What electronic components can cause

306
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,400
future but

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,740
Sometimes we're not sure, but Hollywood is sure

308
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,720
The film industry is very powerful, he will tell us what will happen next

309
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,000
For example, when your people can start to control

310
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
When using chips to control external machinery

311
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
you just...

312
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You may appear like RoboCop, RoboCop

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a possibility that you can control machines outside with just your brain

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Turn the signal of the nerves of your human brain into the signal of an electronic component

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
send out , then go to control the machine

316
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Of course, if one day machines want to control people

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Then the possible situation will be like Magix

318
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We humans become mechanical batteries

319
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Like a hacker character, say that people in the future don't need you to think

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mechanical thinking ability is stronger than yours, I didn't believe it before

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
but since the defeat of afghanistan this...

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We actually ran into some colleagues from the Information Office last time.

323
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He said we're all rethinking who gets to make the decisions

324
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
so this is an interesting question that I think

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is it a machine controller or a human controlling the machine?

326
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Of course we want humans to control the machines

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
No matter which scenario needs an interface

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
How do you transfer energy out of the body

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
How to make the so-called electrical signals and these biological signals of your body

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
produces an appropriate conversion

331
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is the ultimate goal of organic bioelectronics

332
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We want to have a very efficient conversion

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There is a clear conversion

334
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
OK, let me mention it a little more

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
In fact, everyone, I have been interested in this research very early.

336
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I've always found it funny since I probably started in graduate school

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Because everyone knows, of course, on the one hand, we are from Taiwan

338
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Taiwan is the Kingdom of Semiconductors

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Taiwan is electronic components

340
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
most famous country

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Every one of my classmates is in TSMC

342
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Then each of them left TSMC

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Because they all went to start a company

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So everyone has been to TSMC

345
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Each one leaves TSMC

346
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But Taiwan's electronic components

347
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
With such a strong strength

348
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Now it has also entered the so-called Hon Hai of electronic components

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
very early on i started thinking

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Where is the next South China Sea?

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
just say we certainly can't

352
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Just start over and restart a stove

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Where might the next South China Sea for electronic components be?

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
so i always feel like saying

355
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Then shall we just

356
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Let's say you made a nice transistor

357
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can put the transistor

358
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Just insert it directly into the human body to control the human body

359
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
what kind of difficulties it will encounter

360
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
In fact, when I first entered the Ph.

361
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
i had this idea

362
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but i always feel

363
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
My boss won't approve the first one

364
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The second one seems a bit risky

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,700
I can't find anyone to plug, so I can't plug myself

366
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,000
Right, so we want to say

367
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,400
I was thinking about something like this, but

368
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
After ten years, twenty years of thinking

369
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,200
We found that the two middle actually

370
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,400
there is a difference

371
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,100
You can imagine, the traditional electronic components, what kind of characteristics it has

372
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
Traditional electronic components are made of hard materials

373
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,300
All of these materials are required to be stable in the air

374
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,900
Of course, many electronic components have to be unstable in the air

375
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,100
But we use a very precise method to package it up

376
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,700
package it up

377
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,100
So there are many good raw packaging factories in Taiwan

378
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,300
package it up

379
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,900
Then after packaging, the life of these electronic components can be very long

380
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
Then most of the applied one

381
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,800
For one application, the so-called process status is the so-called

382
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,500
CO, is a vapor deposition

383
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,000
is a chemical vapor deposition

384
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,400
It is a way to use, to use the frame rate

385
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,100
Use the gas frame method to go

386
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
then what we need

387
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What we need is that this system is very robust

388
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
For example, if you want to buy a TV

389
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you bought a computer

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Of course you wish you could use it for the rest of your life

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Although your manufacturer may not want you to use it for a lifetime

392
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But the person you buy expects him to use for a lifetime

393
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Then

394
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
at last

395
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This may be a bit more controversial

396
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but actually

397
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
for

398
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
In terms of toxicity

399
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Our requirement is actually full minimum

400
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Just don't be toxic to the environment

401
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't be toxic to the environment when you shoot this thing

402
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then the material used is actually

403
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We all know the materials used to make semiconductors

404
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Impossible not poisonous

405
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
just use light folic acid

406
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Everyone is free to check

407
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What kind of poison is folic acid

408
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What kind of poison is the Buddha's gas used?

409
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It is quite toxic

410
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
but of course we can

411
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We apply sophisticated

412
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
mechanical manipulation

413
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
mechanical engineering techniques

414
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We can maintain it in an environment

415
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
don't let it poison

416
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but essentially use

417
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
is poisonous

418
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
but

419
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Because this program is very good

420
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Then lead to so much output value in Taiwan

421
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,100
Of course it also led us

422
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,900
I didn't see many young people at the scene, but

423
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,340
Just heard the news that

424
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,820
Nowadays, young people are more and more fond of

425
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,000
don't miss Dr.

426
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,500
Because it is very profitable to go to TSMC

427
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
but of course

428
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,200
Taiwan's economy has made considerable contributions

429
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,600
I don't deny it at all

430
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,900
but i can only say

431
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Such a process is

432
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
He does have a different way of thinking and an idea

433
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,900
But when anything you come into contact with living organisms

434
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,400
Let's see what it might need

435
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,400
first in bioelectronics

436
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
Generally speaking, what we want is soft matter

437
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
why soft matter

438
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,800
I often make a metaphor for everyone

439
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,900
Of course, I always feel that my metaphor is very bad.

440
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,800
But let's just listen

441
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,600
Just a question for everyone

442
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
do you like to sleep or

443
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Hard bed or soft bed?

444
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,200
Most people like to sleep on a soft Tuanwang bed

445
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,600
Hard bed but wouldn't you want to sleep on a plank

446
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,900
I'm not saying

447
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,100
For organisms

448
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,900
Thin wafers are not just boards

449
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,600
And it's a cold marble floor

450
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,900
very bad sleep

451
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,000
So any biochip

452
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,400
If you're going to have a meeting with a creature

453
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,300
It actually prefers soft matter

454
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,500
just a bit soft

455
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Whether it is hydrogel, Hydrogel

456
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,000
or how

457
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,200
what it likes is a soft substance

458
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,100
In addition to being stable in the air, it

459
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,100
The most important thing is to be stable in the water

460
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Because the most abundant of all living organisms is water

461
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,000
You have to have water stability

462
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,200
Okay, let's think about the stability of the water again.

463
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
Words on the stability of our water

464
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,300
This is for traditional e-liquid

465
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,200
indeed a challenge

466
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
right

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,480
We often see all kinds of people on the Internet

468
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,140
The PO article said that the iPhone got water accidentally today

469
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,840
then it's over

470
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,740
right so let's think about it

471
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,140
The main thing is your stability in the water

472
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,640
and you made this

473
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,600
The entire process is best made with easy

474
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,040
because it is easy to make

475
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,240
You can use many polymer materials

476
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,340
So my polymer materials cannot be stacked by vaporization

477
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,840
must come with water

478
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
must be handled with easy images

479
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,780
and then the other one is

480
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,280
in bioelectronics

481
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:39,340
If your material is too balanced or too durable

482
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,140
It's not necessarily a good thing

483
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,480
Because sometimes we want this material to be biodegradable

484
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,340
That is to say, when it has completed its mission

485
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,640
organisms will automatically decompose it

486
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,080
In this way, the compounding of nature and your body will be less

487
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,440
So the last thing that matters most is

488
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,040
This toxicity is in bioelectronics

489
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
is a very large concentration because you have to be in direct contact with your body

490
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,000
From a scientific point of view

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,800
He has to touch your body

492
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,700
So we have to have very, very low toxicity

493
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,300
from an economic point of view

494
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,700
Because you have to pass the FDA

495
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,400
you have to go through regulation

496
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,500
You have to go through all the legal institutions to circumvent

497
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,300
You have to have compliance biotoxicity

498
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,300
Otherwise you have no way to go public

499
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,100
you can't turn it into a product

500
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,800
You can't generate market value

501
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,300
this is all in

502
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,000
so-called once inside the biological element

503
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Problems that traditional electronic components must face

504
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,700
So let me do a simple analysis with you first

505
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,800
I hope everyone has a clear statement

506
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,700
Traditional Inorganic Materials

507
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,100
maybe need an up

508
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,000
need an upgrade need an upgrade

509
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,200
for use in bioelectronics

510
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,400
That

511
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,100
the opposite

512
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,900
That

513
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,000
in chemistry

514
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because I still study chemistry

515
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Although many people think that I don’t seem to be doing chemistry recently

516
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But my former university teacher is here

517
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
so i have to say i still study chemistry

518
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So traditional chemistry

519
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Usually, there are two types of materials

520
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
organic materials

521
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Inorganic materials

522
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
that organic material was stigmatized for a while

523
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Now it's more advanced

524
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Because organic food is more expensive

525
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So the word organic has become very advanced again

526
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
for a while organic wasn't great

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
that's it

528
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
so in terms of dialogue

529
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The definition of organic for us is very simple

530
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Organic is a structure based on carbon

531
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
then formed

532
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Focus on co-driving

533
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
some compounds or molecules that form

534
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Inorganic is everything except carbon

535
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
is inorganic

536
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
so but

537
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,600
Traditionally, everyone knows organic, and what everyone knows best about organic is plastic

538
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,400
We usually deal with plastic, plastic, think about it

539
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,780
Thinking about it from the brain, plastic, plastic does not conduct electricity

540
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,340
right , we learn anything

541
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,740
Whether it is middle school or high school, we will be the first to say that plastics do not conduct electricity

542
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,800
Plastic is a flying conductor

543
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,580
Traditionally, the decomposition of organic and inorganic

544
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,940
organics are flying conductors, then inorganic compounds

545
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,780
There are many with metallic luster and high conductivity

546
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
but

547
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,380
all the rules of chemistry

548
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
are all

549
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,980
formulated to be broken

550
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,660
As we enter the millennium, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000

551
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,360
Most importantly to these three gentlemen

552
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,400
Professor Allen Peecker,Professor Allen McDermott

553
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
and Professor Hidesu Shirakawa from Japan, the first two are American professors

554
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
them

555
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,520
discover something together

556
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,560
plastic conducts electricity

557
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We can make conductive plastic

558
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,200
Well, I think today I'm going to take a little time to tell you about this story.

559
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,300
Because the research I did for this story was

560
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,400
it's the whole beginning

561
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
This whole new field of

562
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
a bad wound

563
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,400
That's why my field as a whole started booming

564
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,800
Whether it is organic electronics

565
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,600
no matter how

566
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,600
Next Organic Bioelectronics

567
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,600
I can only say

568
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,700
All our research is standing

569
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,600
Seniors stand on the shoulders of these giants to see the world

570
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
we didn't start from scratch

571
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,500
We are all the result of following others

572
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,400
So we've taken a look for you

573
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,300
All Nobel said that the Nobel words of two thousand years were awarded to these three

574
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,300
Mainly found to say

575
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,700
There is a kind of conductive polymer called

576
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,400
From whitening to complete, it is conductive plastic

577
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,400
plastic is conductive

578
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,900
that's why

579
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,700
I will give you some simple analysis

580
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,400
today so far

581
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,000
actually

582
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm quite proud

583
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,600
But so far I haven't put any chemistry room

584
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,460
He knows that those who study chemistry will definitely get a bachelor of chemistry

585
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,660
I'm sorry, I'm going to put Chem now.

586
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,260
Before that, let me tell you

587
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,100
Because I was still a student when I was able to speak for two thousand years

588
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,020
so in two thousand zero this should be two thousand zero

589
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,660
In 2003 or 2003 in a

590
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,360
Annual Meeting of the American Chemical Society

591
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,400
i was lucky to hear

592
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,300
Lecture by Professor Ellen McDermott

593
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,420
And he's actually a really nice guy

594
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,620
He's also a guy who likes to show off very much

595
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,220
So he put his Nobel medal over there for everyone to take pictures

596
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,820
So you can take pictures if you want

597
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,380
Of course I think it should be true

598
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,120
Shouldn't be shipping

599
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,380
So we based on a student's instinct

600
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,580
Just have something to take care of

601
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,620
You must punch in the photo

602
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,120
no

603
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Although I didn't check in

604
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,620
But there must have been such a thing as punching cards in those days.

605
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,120
Then you can see

606
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,920
This is a photo of the Nobel Prize for two thousand years

607
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,120
Although at that time everyone can realize

608
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,920
The camera at that time was 2 megapixels

609
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So this is a bit unclear

610
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,600
OK, let's tell you a little bit about this story

611
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
This story is actually a

612
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,400
To me it's actually a pretty

613
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,400
pretty inspiring story

614
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,300
That is to say, when we are doing scientific research in chemical research

615
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,600
In fact, this story came from a complete mistake.

616
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,100
I will introduce this error

617
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Then we start with crude oil

618
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,700
Everyone knows polymers

619
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
that is, plastic

620
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,000
most famous of plastics

621
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
This is what is called Juyixi

622
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,900
Taiwan also produces a lot

623
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,600
Juyixi

624
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,000
In chemistry, we do it by taking Yixi

625
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100
this monomer

626
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
make it a

627
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,300
polyyixi

628
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,000
That

629
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,700
Such a process, of course

630
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Yixi is better now than his brother

631
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,100
quite a bit

632
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,600
Because his brother's name is Bingxi

633
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Bingxi is quite notorious now.

634
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,400
Because it's notorious since Ma Kaohsiung bombed

635
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
What about his gas?

636
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,340
Polymers can then become Polymers

637
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,420
Then if we use some

638
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,820
Catholist

639
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
with some coarser

640
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,020
Especially do what we call Cigernata Catis

641
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,580
Of course Cigernata Catis is another Nobel Prize

642
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,580
This is the 1963 Nobel Prize

643
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,020
someone found out

644
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,780
How to use lizards to make high value

645
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,260
very tall great polyether material

646
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,520
these two

647
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,540
Cigur discovered this together with Nata

648
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,260
because of its strong economic value

649
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,260
So that's why later

650
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Plastic has become a very dominant material in the world

651
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,180
Because we have discovered many new ways in the village

652
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,820
Capable of making very high value polylizards

653
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,180
that in chemistry in science

654
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,940
people are quick to think

655
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,460
So what can Cigernata Catis start doing

656
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,060
So in 1955 to 1960 can start

657
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,940
use

658
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,180
one of lizards

659
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,100
a compound of a brother

660
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,380
lizard

661
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,780
want to aggregate it

662
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,660
poly-lizard

663
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,060
see if there is

664
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,300
something like this happens

665
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,100
That 195.12.6 says

666
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
many people send

667
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,440
some people reported that

668
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,700
According to lack of discovery

669
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,100
But what they found missing was a

670
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,600
black powder

671
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,300
black powder

672
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,300
That

673
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
I just mentioned three professors

674
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
Professor Na Shirakawa

675
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,600
At that time he had just started his research career

676
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,400
he

677
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,600
just want to try this experiment

678
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,200
to learn about this experiment

679
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,000
what about this time

680
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
some day

681
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,400
He was with a Korean student

682
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,500
found to say

683
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,200
Eh

684
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,800
he reacts the same way

685
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,900
he found out that

686
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,600
Eh

687
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,700
how did he get one

688
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,800
A film with a metallic luster

689
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,600
what happened

690
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,000
so what

691
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,400
words in the lab

692
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,500
i think we

693
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,100
presence if

694
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,800
probably many are

695
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,100
the ancestors of the Central Academy

696
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,900
I may also have domestic scholars

697
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,500
we see this problem

698
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Of course we're going back and checking our lab notes

699
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,100
see bottom

700
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What went wrong

701
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,760
they found one thing

702
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,960
Oops, they made the most of chemists

703
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,640
worst mistake

704
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
It's just that they miscalculated the equivalent

705
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,640
That is to say, when they write, they put

706
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,160
It is possible to put minimolar mini

707
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,940
change, forget, mm

708
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,480
millet

709
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
forgot

710
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,240
So they used a thousand times

711
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,440
Equivalent

712
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,640
Chemicals

713
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,360
Use a very large amount of deodorant

714
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,640
So the reaction is very fast

715
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,240
It only takes a minute or two for the film to form

716
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
very fast

717
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,240
This is completely different from previous reports

718
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,800
so of course

719
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,200
What happens next is even more special

720
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,880
generally speaking

721
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,280
Sometimes we find that

722
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,360
especially

723
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,280
We don't see too many students on site

724
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,960
sometimes, but maybe

725
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,680
There are students live

726
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,720
Sometimes students see something wrong

727
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,440
I feel like, ah, what's wrong?

728
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,080
wash him off , don ' t tell the teacher

729
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,240
Otherwise, maybe the teachers will scold me

730
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,960
in this way

731
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,480
But something is wrong

732
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,920
Sometimes, will give you some new

733
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,020
Often many scientific discoveries

734
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,800
in such an error

735
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,640
produce a beautiful result

736
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,000
So when they found this metallic luster

737
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
Actually quite excited

738
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
just found out

739
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,200
Hey, what the hell is this thing?

740
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,500
just at this time

741
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,800
He later discovered this in 1967

742
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,200
until 1975

743
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
the second of these

744
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Professor Nadelman

745
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,400
he went to japan

746
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
At that time, Professor Baichuan Yingxiu was at Dongqing Public Health University

747
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
when he visited

748
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Professor Baichuan Yingxiu is discussing the result

749
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,200
he is very excited

750
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
He immediately invited Professor Baichuan to come in 1977

751
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Excuse me

752
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,500
Eh, very wrong

753
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,300
1977 time to

754
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,100
arrive

755
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,900
arrive

756
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,900
Uh Penn

757
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,400
when they were at the university of penn

758
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,600
to do

759
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,800
Profession

760
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,600
That's why they systematically discovered

761
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,100
turn out to be

762
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,400
what he synthesized

763
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,800
According to lack

764
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,600
might be one of these

765
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,000
biology of a molecule

766
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But the structure of this molecule is not the source of the conduction

767
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
but like a semiconductor

768
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
When I apply some compound in the middle go

769
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
so-called defects

770
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
let these all the orbitals of this molecule

771
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
When the consensus molecular orbitals create defects

772
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
it produces like metal

773
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
The so-called electronic belt and driving belt

774
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The so-called Valence Band

775
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
A concept with Conduction Band

776
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Then they learned that

777
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Where does the conductivity of atoms come from?

778
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
According to the Shirakawa Sonic System

779
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's my own autobiography

780
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
They were in the lab that day

781
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
once

782
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
When the time comes their show

783
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Show gas once down after

784
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
he noticed that

785
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Conductivity increased by a million-fold

786
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Because the equipment at that time was very bad

787
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Just no Auto Switch

788
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So you have to use the Menu Switch

789
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,600
What will be the problem if the current is suddenly too high?

790
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,000
The machine will burn

791
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,800
So they took one of their

792
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,600
4.0 pog is burned

793
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
but anyway

794
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,800
Burned a 4.0pog in exchange for a Nobel Prize

795
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,200
i think it's worth it

796
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,400
ok

797
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,800
So here is a story for you

798
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,600
Of course this story is for us

799
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
To me, the inspiration is that

800
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,400
In fact, sometimes this thing actually

801
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
that time

802
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
And their first paper was published in a

803
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,400
A very specialized journal in chemistry is called CAMCO

804
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Now many people want to talk about publishing Science

805
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,200
Nature

806
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
They are not posting Science

807
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,000
Nature

808
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,200
They actually put a lot of effort into these a lot

809
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,600
Very basic and Fundamental

810
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
very basic science

811
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,400
Get some results that no one else thought of

812
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,200
I believe everyone in Xuehua knows that

813
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,200
traditional organic and inorganic

814
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,400
A so-called boundary is broken

815
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,000
the first time was in

816
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
18 years old

817
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,900
The so-called Ulava

818
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,900
can make green acid

819
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
hydrocyanic acid

820
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
when it becomes urea

821
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,360
This is the so-called low boundary between organic and inorganic is broken

822
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
after

823
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,900
When we found Fyrocyn

824
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,740
When I found Tie Erwu Wan

825
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,240
electricity is broken

826
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,560
Then this can be said to be broken again for the third time.

827
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,060
Because we used to think that only metals can conduct electricity

828
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Now it is not

829
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,200
Planned

830
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,100
piece of plastic

831
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,400
it also conducts electricity

832
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,000
and it will have different properties

833
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,700
because it is soft matter

834
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,000
is a soft substance that conducts electricity

835
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,740
OK

836
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,940
Then I would like to take this opportunity to mention a little bit.

837
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,240
Because I just mentioned that Vice President Zhou

838
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,300
i am in japan

839
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,400
The School of Physics and Chemistry has worked in the institute for six years

840
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,740
Actually, I know some of Shirakawa's students

841
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,800
In fact, Professor Shirakawa Hidesu is a

842
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,240
very funny chemist

843
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,700
I tell you his story

844
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,000
thinking about private matters

845
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,640
because i think i will

846
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
talk about everything

847
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,900
I hope everyone can take the blame for this

848
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,200
That is to say, Professor Hideso Shirakawa

849
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,000
actually a

850
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I think, the title behind this is not written by any magazine, nor is it written by a weekly magazine. I think

851
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
He's an underrated trans scientist.

852
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Because he was born in Tokyo in 1936

853
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He received a Ph.D. from Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1966

854
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
In 1967, it was discovered that lack of metal luster

855
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In 1976, he was a visiting researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1977, they discovered that the conductive graph can be increased by 1 million times.

856
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
But no one cares about this result

857
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
In 1979, under the Japanese system

858
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Generally speaking, wherever you get your Ph.D., you will find ways to become an assistant professor in that laboratory

859
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Associate Professor , Becoming Professor of Politics

860
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But because people don't think his result is nothing

861
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So he was forced to move from Tokyo Institute of Technology to Takesa University, where he became a professor

862
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Then in March 2000

863
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You can count it, that is, he is 65 years old, and he is going to retire

864
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,400
pension

865
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
he

866
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,600
The Japanese system is like this

867
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Maybe they are all Japanese friends

868
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,560
Well done if you call retirement

869
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,060
Like Vice President Zhou

870
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,900
You can change to another place to continue your career

871
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
Although you have to retire where you were

872
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,560
but you may have to be able to go to the next place

873
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
but

874
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,840
no one wants him

875
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,760
Enough University March 2003

876
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,000
he is basically

877
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Retire naked

878
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I don't mean to quit naked

879
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,700
He took his pension

880
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
but

881
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,800
did not continue him

882
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,000
He said my research career was over

883
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,200
And then more ironically

884
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,500
In October 2001 he won the Nobel Prize

885
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,700
all the schools start looking for him

886
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,600
his students told me

887
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,400
he told them

888
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,600
Back then you didn't want me

889
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,900
I don't want you now

890
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,400
He continues to retreat naked

891
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,300
he just stays on

892
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,300
stay in

893
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,800
He actually did something

894
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,600
because i know him

895
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,600
i know him students tell me

896
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,800
their science museum in japan

897
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,500
There are experiments to teach children to do conductive polymers

898
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,000
He will personally explain to them

899
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,700
what is the principle of this experiment

900
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,600
He is a

901
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,900
Even if he was bigger than the professor last year

902
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,900
The Nobel Prize-winning animal that died because of cells

903
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,400
He also came out to criticize

904
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,500
Today's young people don't know how to do mental science

905
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,100
In fact, he has great enthusiasm for this science.

906
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
But when

907
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,400
whether in japan

908
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
Actually in Japan

909
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,000
He is also a very underrated word also called

910
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
of all nobel prizes

911
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,500
No one particularly admires him

912
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,300
but

913
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,500
I can only say he really

914
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
I to me he's really a very serious scientist

915
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,300
There are also many serious scientists in the Central Academy

916
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,000
that is

917
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
we found a phenomenon

918
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,800
we are willing to pursue

919
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Science is supposed to be a pursuit

920
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,700
Sometimes you don't care what's going on outside

921
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,800
or what others have to say

922
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,700
we just keep going

923
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
so he

924
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,000
i feel in

925
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,700
take advantage of

926
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,900
Usually I don't know how to talk about this

927
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,400
but

928
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,900
Since it is a knowledge experiment

929
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,100
I thought I'd share it with you

930
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,900
this is me

931
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,400
he treats me personally

932
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,900
all one

933
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,020
Enlightenment and inspiration

934
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,020
That is to say

935
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,120
I think sometimes scientific research does not need to think too much

936
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,140
what can be used

937
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,520
can it be used

938
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,120
All he actually found was an attitude

939
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,480
He actually didn't do it

940
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,880
what's behind

941
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,680
organic light emitting diode

942
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
Organic Electron

943
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,080
he didn't do it

944
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,640
The only thing he did was understand

945
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,800
conductive polymer

946
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,480
why conduct electricity

947
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,720
He spent a lot of effort to understand this matter

948
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,520
Then I think this is a very important one

949
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,960
Fundamental Science的improvement

950
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,800
so why

951
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,880
2000 will not speak

952
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,360
Although he is not the first to make a conductive polymer

953
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,600
but he

954
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,760
Share this Price with two other scientists

955
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,400
ok

956
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,800
then i will continue

957
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
Compare

958
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,880
academic part

959
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,160
That is to say

960
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,920
Of course, we first started from this so-called

961
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,680
The shortage begins

962
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,840
but the same structure

963
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,000
Chemists are smart

964
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,640
use it in various ways

965
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,040
to cause this

966
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,200
so-called co-double bond

967
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,040
So if you have any questions

968
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,480
To have two double bonds is

969
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,040
you two

970
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,820
One sword is called double sword, one sword is called single sword

971
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,400
That is to say, you must be two swords and one sword

972
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,700
Two swords and one sword, two swords and one sword, lined up like this

973
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,820
We found many different

974
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,980
There are cases where compounds contain the so-called

975
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,100
Jupiluo, two swords and one sword

976
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,300
two swords one sword two swords one sword two swords one sword

977
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,240
Or Jusunfen, two swords and one sword

978
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,860
Two swords and one sword, even combined swords

979
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,140
A lot of different things are also being thought about, such as

980
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,200
polyanoling, it also conducts electricity

981
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,120
There are even some more complex

982
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,580
Contains the so-called aggregated to... aggregated to the missing

983
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,980
If you get together, they will also conduct electricity

984
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,420
These materials are actually very important, because some of them conduct electricity

985
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,200
Some are now being used as optoelectronic materials

986
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,700
These materials, in varying amounts, allow the field to flourish

987
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,820
This is in chemical science

988
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,980
As for the application

989
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I believe everyone

990
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,200
More or less have heard of these applications

991
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,900
Of course, the most famous of these is the

992
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,000
OLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode

993
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,500
many of you now

994
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,400
mobile phone backplane

995
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
We all claim to be the backplane of OLED

996
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,600
even this one

997
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,700
this is

998
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,200
sorry this is korean

999
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,800
Because Taiwan has not yet made it

1000
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,000
This is Korean and this is Samsung

1001
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,800
OLED to Think TV

1002
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,400
there is also

1003
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,200
Maybe it's made so-called organic

1004
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,700
Transistor

1005
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,400
That

1006
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,500
We all know that the biggest difference between Internet material and obligation quality is

1007
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,300
We are now bendable transistors

1008
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,100
This transistor can be bent

1009
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,800
Transistors that become so-called late

1010
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,400
Then this is a solar panel of the late style

1011
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,300
Organic Solar Panels

1012
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,500
even if you put the transistor

1013
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,700
make one with a creature

1014
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,000
This is more like outside

1015
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,800
So we're not really bioelectronics

1016
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,500
Because bioelectronics our way is inside the body

1017
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,500
But in vitro it can also be designed as

1018
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,000
like

1019
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
An artificial hand like this

1020
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,380
This is made by Professor Somya of the University of Tokyo

1021
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
These are mainly currently

1022
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,380
market or company

1023
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,380
Prototypes that can already be seen

1024
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,880
When the employed person in Central was in chemistry

1025
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
we also do

1026
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,380
Many of my colleagues are also doing this kind of research.

1027
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,880
did a pretty good job too

1028
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
of course

1029
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,380
My interest is sometimes

1030
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,880
most of the time

1031
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Not the same as others

1032
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,880
It was when my classmates were going to TSMC

1033
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
I choose to study chemistry

1034
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
so of course they are doing

1035
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
this when i look at

1036
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
A lot of people do this when Invipend

1037
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
solar cell what?

1038
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
but i think

1039
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,880
I don't know because maybe I'm more afraid of competition

1040
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,880
I think I might not win even in competition

1041
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,880
in this way

1042
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
or I feel tired of competing

1043
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,880
So we just make a new one that is

1044
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
I want to know what he is biologically

1045
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,880
how do we combine

1046
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,880
how to design

1047
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,880
How do we make this phenomenon available in living organisms

1048
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
Can

1049
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
non-stop application

1050
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
right

1051
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,000
So let me introduce one more

1052
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
the most important thing is to say

1053
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,500
just mentioned one thing

1054
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,000
Even living organisms have electricity

1055
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
But with

1056
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,000
The electricity of electronic components is not the same as electricity

1057
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What about the electricity in living organisms?

1058
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
this is the nervous system

1059
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
nervous system

1060
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
This is what I cut out from a paper

1061
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
so more complicated

1062
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
But the main thing is that there is this so-called

1063
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Bandwide section

1064
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
There is a part called Axon

1065
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,500
what is so called

1066
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
the most important

1067
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
I think this simplifies it

1068
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
explain to you

1069
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,500
the most important thing is to say

1070
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
it is done by some

1071
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
easy one

1072
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,500
concentration difference

1073
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
produces a so-called

1074
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Potential difference

1075
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,500
this is called

1076
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Usually we call it Axon Potential

1077
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
kinetic potential

1078
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
That is, it uses some of the

1079
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
ion channel

1080
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Contains the ion channel

1081
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
or pseudo ion channel

1082
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,500
when using it to send out ion channels

1083
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,020
The resulting potential difference

1084
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,080
between different cells

1085
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,280
This potential difference can be transmitted continuously

1086
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
and then at the end

1087
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,180
when it utilizes this so-called Excel tail-end

1088
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,680
it utilizes this tail

1089
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
This potential can stimulate it

1090
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
to secrete so-called neurotransmitters

1091
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
to the next neuron source

1092
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
So one of the most important things is

1093
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
source of the signal

1094
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,680
In fact, these ions and these

1095
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
neurotransmitter

1096
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Now here comes the problem

1097
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,680
our electric substance

1098
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,680
The signal transmitted is from electronic and electric

1099
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Neurogenic is derived from ionic

1100
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,680
What about these two things?

1101
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,680
to talk

1102
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,680
how to talk

1103
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
at this time

1104
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
conductive polymer

1105
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680
another feature

1106
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
when we designed

1107
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,680
don't know

1108
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,680
but

1109
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
It's amazing in a

1110
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Such a one with a plan

1111
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Naturally, there will be such characteristics

1112
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
this is where we go now

1113
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
let's take a closer look

1114
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
If a conductive polymer

1115
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It is a structure like this

1116
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
That might be a molecular structure like this

1117
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
when it

1118
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
when current is applied to it

1119
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
That is, when you give it an electrical signal

1120
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
This compound molecule

1121
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
The polymer itself will be oxidized

1122
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
produces an electrochemical reaction

1123
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That is to say, the chemical system

1124
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It was great

1125
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
can combine electricity and chemistry

1126
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
medium

1127
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It produces an electrochemical reaction after

1128
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Because the entire conductor must maintain electrical neutrality

1129
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
So it must start from

1130
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Easy to absorb ions in

1131
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
that is, naturally

1132
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It takes this electrical signal

1133
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
becomes an ion signal

1134
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And how much electricity do you add

1135
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
How many ions does it absorb

1136
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
These two will produce a linear relationship

1137
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,580
That is, conductive organic conductive materials

1138
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,900
itself is a good way to connect electrons and ions

1139
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,480
A tool that can do a signal conversion

1140
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,900
That's why we can quickly

1141
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,340
Putting conductive polymers on their own can do things like

1142
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,660
And in this process, there is actually a side effect

1143
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,460
It's because you sucked in the ions

1144
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,500
So this thing gets bigger

1145
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,320
If the volume becomes larger, you can feel it

1146
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,420
it will produce if you stick it on a board

1147
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,620
As it gets bigger, the board bends

1148
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,920
You restore it again, and the board comes back

1149
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,120
So we can design something like

1150
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,920
Kinetic components, Kinetic components

1151
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,880
For example, the film below

1152
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,480
It is actually a fixed state

1153
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,040
One piece is the dynamic state of this conductive polymer

1154
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,920
So you can tell when I give it a Pulse

1155
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,680
It can produce a vibration phenomenon

1156
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,480
produce such a movement phenomenon

1157
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,040
This can be used as a

1158
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,400
actuator or a more popular name

1159
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,100
we call it artificial muscle

1160
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,400
like your muscles

1161
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
can move around like this

1162
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:08,900
can move around

1163
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,800
Just call it artificial muscle

1164
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,400
ok

1165
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,100
so i want to share

1166
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,300
So such organic bioelectronic components

1167
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,900
on application

1168
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,000
There are many possible potential

1169
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Of course, I like this field very much.

1170
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,100
I also believe that this field has considerable value in the industry

1171
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,800
Especially in Taiwan so big

1172
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,400
Such a powerful electronic component

1173
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,800
With the support of an electronics factory

1174
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,400
With such good technology

1175
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,500
This direction is actually for the electronics factory

1176
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,900
It's not that hard to get into the horizontal ditch

1177
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,200
Maybe even sometimes I think it's better than medicine

1178
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,100
Biological technology may be even easier

1179
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,100
because we have mastered ourselves

1180
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,800
It is the technology of making this electronic component

1181
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,700
The main generation may have bio-detectors

1182
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,700
or a bioelectrode

1183
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,100
Or there are some so-called neurological

1184
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,260
stimulating electrodes

1185
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,260
that's sorry for the rest

1186
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,260
I don't know how to turn

1187
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,140
so i use english

1188
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,840
the so-called

1189
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,540
It's getting married

1190
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,700
so-called artificial muscles

1191
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,140
I just gave you an example

1192
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,020
or so-called

1193
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,140
Medical Bionics

1194
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,440
just like that

1195
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,780
like robocop

1196
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,280
how do i get my brain waves

1197
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,720
can control me outside

1198
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,480
The movement of this biomimetic system

1199
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,680
even

1200
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,980
There are still many

1201
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,580
Includes Electronic Skin

1202
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,180
is how on your skin

1203
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,820
started to put on

1204
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,520
Install the detector

1205
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,980
So when your hand moves

1206
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,580
This receptor naturally has a signal

1207
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,880
you can learn

1208
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,020
You can send signals automatically

1209
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,120
even

1210
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,060
I have new ones recently

1211
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,520
one is someone put

1212
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,020
such a wafer

1213
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,600
implanted in your nervous system

1214
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
Then use a phenomenon of biological

1215
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,040
when an electric signal is emitted

1216
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,400
The nervous system stimulates the immune system

1217
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,700
Immunotherapy can begin

1218
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,540
this you on the internet

1219
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,980
can be found

1220
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,080
I

1221
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,800
How to Harness Organic Bioelectronic Components

1222
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
as a medicine

1223
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,400
Use it to stimulate your body to release

1224
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,900
Chemicals your body is supposed to release

1225
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,400
Diseases that cause your body can be cured

1226
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
Some people are doing these studies

1227
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,900
very responsible of course

1228
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,400
I have to tell everyone here

1229
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
Well, it's just a matter of being a member.

1230
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,400
actually

1231
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,400
Organic Electronic Components

1232
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,900
enough trouble

1233
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,400
Because organic electronic components contain chemical

1234
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
physics engineering

1235
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,300
Well, if you think about it, organic bioelectronic components

1236
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,300
Includes Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, Biology and Medicine

1237
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,300
So all of you have to come together

1238
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,300
This is totally transpsychic research

1239
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,800
you are unlikely to do it alone

1240
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,100
You have to have a lot of like minded people

1241
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
would like to share this

1242
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,600
Such research goals, research ideals

1243
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,300
to be able to do

1244
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,300
I'm lucky enough to always have

1245
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,300
People are willing to cooperate with me

1246
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,300
so we

1247
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,900
I actually basically do stuff

1248
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
see you later

1249
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Actually the most basic one

1250
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
maybe say yes

1251
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
You can say it is the most critical one on the component

1252
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
But it's actually very simple

1253
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
All I do is say how to control

1254
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
this electronic component

1255
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
an interface with the organism

1256
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
How to make this interface ensure that

1257
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
electrical and biological signals

1258
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
able to deliver the complete

1259
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
won't lose

1260
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
using chemistry and materials

1261
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
this is what i'm doing

1262
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't design electronics

1263
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'm not going to take these either

1264
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Neither do I

1265
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Actually I also

1266
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
maybe we will

1267
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
But we're not doing animal testing right now

1268
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
neither do we

1269
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
we also ask the doctor

1270
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
or who cooperates

1271
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Let's learn about this together

1272
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
possibility

1273
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
OK

1274
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
That

1275
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
for the rest of the time

1276
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I

1277
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I still want

1278
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I think

1279
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
still want to introduce

1280
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
what are we doing

1281
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
because at least

1282
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I just talked for so long

1283
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
it's not what we do

1284
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Thanks

1285
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I just want to introduce

1286
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
what we do

1287
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I probably spent just a little bit of time left

1288
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I just introduce an example

1289
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
materials we use

1290
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It is also a conductive polymer material

1291
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Its organic structure looks like this

1292
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
If you want to know something today

1293
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I strongly recommend that you know we're doing big P

1294
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
This material is called PEDOT for short.

1295
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
no Chinese

1296
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
English is called PEDOT

1297
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
When you talk about PEDOT, everyone knows it better.

1298
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
that this material

1299
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
What I'm introducing to you is

1300
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
of organic electronics

1301
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
how to say

1302
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
if you are american

1303
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You say the Michael Jackson of organic electronics

1304
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Or the Jay Chou of organic electronics

1305
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
He's the Super Young of the Organic Electronics World

1306
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
His patent expired last year

1307
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Then the whole world is making this material

1308
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,520
parks in taiwan

1309
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,980
Wait for me to ask, I said how to make this material

1310
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:07,620
Because this material is a super material for organic electronics

1311
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,140
its cause

1312
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,140
it has a chemical reason

1313
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,980
Let me analyze it a little bit with you because I think

1314
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,440
It is my responsibility

1315
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,140
You can see double bond single bond

1316
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,660
This is the basic one

1317
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,460
The structure of conductive polymer

1318
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,360
But a very important issue in conducting polymers is

1319
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,580
these two positions

1320
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,060
would have been empty

1321
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,080
if you are empty in

1322
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,080
When making this film, there may be

1323
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,060
Accidentally connect the wrong look

1324
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,380
it is possible to get here

1325
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,540
If you have a handle, please draw it

1326
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,540
If this key is accidentally attached here

1327
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,240
It will not form a single bond double bond single bond double bond structure

1328
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,460
Then its conductivity will become poor.

1329
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:49,660
the second is

1330
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:54,420
So in this molecule these two positions are completely blocked

1331
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,860
And the two oxygen

1332
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,660
will provide a function

1333
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,100
it will make this one thing

1334
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Oxidation Potential Decrease

1335
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
become more suitable for

1336
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,500
Use in normal condition

1337
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,000
Do not use at too high a potential

1338
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,500
so

1339
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,000
This molecule has a very ingenious structure

1340
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,500
it accomplishes many things

1341
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,000
it has high conductivity

1342
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
it has high conductivity

1343
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
it has few flaws

1344
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
and very stable

1345
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,000
because all its places are filled

1346
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
impossible

1347
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,500
There will be various

1348
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
And it's conductive this element

1349
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,500
blocked in this all

1350
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,500
middle of molecular structure

1351
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
that first this

1352
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,500
Polymer is a

1353
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Bayer AG

1354
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,500
Developed by Bayer AG

1355
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,000
So at first it had a

1356
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The commercial name is called Biochrome

1357
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,500
but then

1358
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Everyone knows Peter

1359
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,500
then later became Helix Corporation

1360
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,500
so it's so far

1361
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
it's in all sorts of places you

1362
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
In fact, conductive polymers, we all think that they

1363
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
This electronic component

1364
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
OLED, none of us has OLED, not everyone has an LED TV

1365
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
But some conductive polymers

1366
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Already used in your daily life

1367
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
like solid capacitors

1368
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Solid capacitors are basically poly pyro

1369
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
They are all skin-determined solid capacitors

1370
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Because his capacitance is also very good

1371
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
even solid capacitors, even supercapacitors

1372
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
conductive polymer

1373
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
So this material already has very, very many possibilities

1374
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It contains organic thermoelectric materials

1375
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Organic Antistatic Materials

1376
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Contains ultracapacitor material

1377
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Even contains organic color-changing glass

1378
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Many people are doing this thermoelectric material

1379
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
So I say this material is the Jay Chou of the organic electronics world

1380
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Just remember, it is Jay Chou

1381
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
When I see Jay Chou, I think of him

1382
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
OK, let's continue to introduce

1383
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Our own laboratory, in fact, one of the characteristics of the organic

1384
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
because you have all kinds of organic structures

1385
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
So we can use organic synthesis

1386
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,000
To bring out the functionality of the material we want

1387
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
brought out in molecular design, we can control its molecular design

1388
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
In nanostructures, we can use such materials

1389
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Can form different nanostructures

1390
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Of course because today we're going to talk about nanostructures

1391
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So I won't introduce you to nanostructures anymore

1392
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
We can take advantage of its nanostructure

1393
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's like saying we have two weapons

1394
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That is, if we put it together

1395
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
We can be applied in many, many aspects of biomedicine

1396
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
The pope that contains biological images is going to be done in our laboratory

1397
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Contains biological detection

1398
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,320
Often a speech might be either this or this

1399
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,800
It is biological detection

1400
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,200
or organic bioelectronics

1401
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,100
Then I will just introduce to you today

1402
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,900
we are in our laboratory

1403
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,600
By different molecular design

1404
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,000
we can list

1405
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,300
We can design two kinds of molecules

1406
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:23,000
One is able to bring out its importance

1407
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,600
For example, there are some organic shut-off groups at the end

1408
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,200
Or you could say it's a living organism's shutdown mechanism

1409
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,400
Because it contains succinic acid and contains amine groups

1410
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,100
Even contains some like this Malayimid

1411
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,800
or some sugar group

1412
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,500
Even or some groups of stacked eggs

1413
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,500
It can quickly combine with living organisms as a co-pilot

1414
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,500
And produce the functionalities we need

1415
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,700
on the other hand

1416
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,000
It has another set of monomers

1417
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,900
is used to control the properties of the surface of the material

1418
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
For example, we can touch the surface

1419
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Pick up a lot of Foki

1420
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,500
Then connect with Doverki and he becomes

1421
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,500
Teflon like material

1422
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,000
Can

1423
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Nonstick

1424
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
can do many things

1425
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,500
can also be connected

1426
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,000
For example, water-based materials

1427
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
especially these

1428
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,500
very very clear material

1429
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Include

1430
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,500
Polyethylene glycol

1431
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,000
contains some

1432
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,500
Dielectric materials

1433
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
can let him

1434
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,500
can go

1435
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,000
lead him to the organism's

1436
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,500
Binding is very, very selective

1437
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,000
These are actually

1438
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,500
we are imitating

1439
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Molecular Design in Organisms

1440
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
we just put

1441
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
Molecular Design in Organisms

1442
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,000
put it on the main chain

1443
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,500
replace us

1444
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,000
Just the conductive polymer material you want to use

1445
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The most important thing is that we first have

1446
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
More than 80 such monomers

1447
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,500
has been synthesized

1448
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,000
probably also

1449
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:06,400
Because in fact, it is probably one of the labs that have done the most

1450
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,060
On the other hand, they can also be processed by a different so-called molding process

1451
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:19,980
Or the process of real science, the process of Lysography

1452
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:26,620
They can make all kinds of different, different difficult materials

1453
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,740
I just want to introduce to you, we have done some

1454
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:38,140
All kinds of materials with thin films and materials with rice noodles

1455
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:42,060
Material with resistant rice grains

1456
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,900
There are also hollow resistant rice grain materials

1457
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:52,460
There are even some like fibers, fibrous materials

1458
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:56,560
Even the material of the rice point, even the material of the rice column

1459
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:59,900
We've all done a lot, a lot of different materials

1460
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,200
Why?

1461
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:03,900
right?

1462
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,200
So in a situation like this

1463
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,400
We make such a wide variety of materials

1464
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,100
Can be applied in different places

1465
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,900
can control

1466
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,400
In the experiment we started with

1467
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,300
we want to control cells

1468
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,600
i.e. living organisms

1469
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,600
because it is called an organism

1470
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,000
It is unlikely that we will directly make chairs

1471
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,600
Let's start with cells

1472
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,800
Do a cell experiment in vitro

1473
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,300
We can understand cells in living organisms

1474
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,900
How can the best behave

1475
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,000
ok , now back to the one thing i just said

1476
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,100
As I said, when I first started PHS

1477
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:39,700
I really want to directly

1478
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,500
buy one

1479
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,000
Actually I said

1480
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,600
It seems that we have asked our professor

1481
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,700
Can I buy a piece of TFT

1482
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:46,800
then cut it all

1483
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,400
Then stuff it in that animal

1484
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,400
That

1485
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,600
Let's see if we can record the animal's telegram.

1486
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,500
that's

1487
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,600
Actually this should not work

1488
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:58,500
Why

1489
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,100
I will introduce you a little

1490
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,640
This thing is called obligatory response

1491
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,600
i believe in speaking obligatory response

1492
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,400
You may feel

1493
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,800
clam what is this

1494
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,600
But everyone has probably been hurt

1495
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,600
everyone will notice that

1496
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,240
If you accidentally drop something

1497
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,900
into your hand

1498
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,480
how will your hands react

1499
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,800
it doesn't bleed all the time

1500
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,300
it won't bleed

1501
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,400
it will find a way to heal it

1502
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,000
The way it goes to treat it is simple

1503
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,200
it's in your

1504
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,500
It only has this obligation to go in

1505
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,900
It triggers a series of immune responses

1506
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,100
Let your body automatically produce a protective function

1507
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,900
This protective function means

1508
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,100
wrap it up

1509
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,100
create a thin membrane to wrap it around

1510
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,100
wrap that thick film around it

1511
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,100
that so

1512
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,600
You may have heard many such testimonies

1513
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,100
that is to say, for example

1514
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,400
during world war two

1515
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,300
There are a lot of people who take out some kind of shards of glass in their heads

1516
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,100
They are comparable to this shard of glass

1517
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Or a bunch of these eggshells were taken out all over the body.

1518
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Somebody even has a bullet and stays in that

1519
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Of course some are comics and some are real

1520
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
In fact, sometimes comics are written like real

1521
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I don't know which is real and which is manga

1522
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But many such cases exist

1523
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
That's actually the body's natural protective response.

1524
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
when he sees something

1525
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
He thinks it's not time for amypods

1526
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
He is learning the Great Wall right next to him

1527
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
separate it

1528
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It's not just this but all objects will have a reaction

1529
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
so but just thinking about it

1530
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Then you go in with such a thin chip

1531
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
For him, detail is something he has never seen in his body

1532
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
There is actually no thin body in that body

1533
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
what should he do

1534
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Of course he treats it as a foreign object

1535
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So the thin wafer goes in

1536
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
He's sure to make a thick layer of it

1537
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And then you want to see your thick biological layer

1538
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
is an insulating layer

1539
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,500
It must prevent the signal from being transmitted

1540
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,500
So in this case

1541
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,000
There is no way we can continue to use this chip

1542
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,500
so for this matter

1543
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,500
what we can do is

1544
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,500
We can do proper molecular design

1545
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:20,500
Find a way to turn this immune response

1546
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,000
or protection

1547
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,500
suppress it

1548
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,500
That is a very common method

1549
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,000
is the so-called use

1550
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Bionic materials

1551
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
we are hospitalized at central

1552
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,500
when i was in japan

1553
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
have also developed a series of

1554
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,000
Organic Conductive Materials Imitating Cell Membranes

1555
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,500
That is to say

1556
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,500
look carefully

1557
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Today the cell membrane is made of a pile of paper

1558
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,500
form the cell membrane

1559
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
it is clear water on one side

1560
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,000
one side is water

1561
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,500
Today if we put the water delivery end

1562
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,000
All replaced with conductive polymer

1563
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,500
Then keep the water list

1564
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,000
In this way we get a material

1565
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,420
Much like a cell membrane, but it retains its clear water end

1566
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:10,000
At the same time, on this conductive polymer, we can also learn how cells

1567
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,220
to lead to some specific identification

1568
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,520
For example, there are various proteins on the cell membrane

1569
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,960
Cell recognition using amino acids and even sugars

1570
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,660
We can all use molecular design to induce such cell recognition

1571
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:32,820
For example, we can connect various protein leagants to conductive polymers

1572
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:42,120
Some of the so-called ligands of these proteins are currently commonly used in academia

1573
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:51,920
So ours contains the so-called RGD, a leapt like RGD

1574
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:58,480
Or the leanant like IKVAV, the leanant of RGD is cut out from the so-called collagen

1575
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,900
We can control this interface

1576
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,200
can achieve what we want to do is

1577
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,900
At the same time, it will not produce rejection reaction with organisms

1578
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,700
What about such a design?

1579
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,400
We did some simple experiments

1580
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,000
Although simple

1581
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,100
But the whole experiment took about three or four years

1582
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,000
from molecular design

1583
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,200
From designing one like this one

1584
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,600
one that can culture cells

1585
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,200
simple one

1586
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,400
one

1587
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,900
a so-called platform

1588
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,100
Then we grow cells on top of

1589
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,300
Coated with our different materials

1590
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,000
let's compare it

1591
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
appearance of cultured cells

1592
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
so

1593
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I can only give you a brief report on the results

1594
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,500
These two are compared

1595
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,200
This is the control group

1596
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,000
These two are the experimental group

1597
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,500
One of the experimental group had applied voltage

1598
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,200
one without voltage

1599
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,700
We use our new biomimetic cell membrane conductive polymer

1600
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:09,100
And in the case of appropriate private family pressure

1601
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:16,600
We achieved a very good result of stimulating the growth of nerve cells

1602
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,900
That is to say, we use the simplest way

1603
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,200
is the way we look at how fast neuron protrusions can grow

1604
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,500
let's measure

1605
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,900
What we get is one of the highest values ​​ever seen on the striae

1606
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,600
about two and a half times higher

1607
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,200
That is, there is an increase in length of 1.5 times

1608
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,600
It's just a simple application of a voltage and some molecular design

1609
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:45,300
I think the most important reason is because we are in such a biomimetic molecular interface

1610
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:49,900
We make sure that the electron follows this

1611
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:55,800
There is a good electron ion transfer effect between cells

1612
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,200
That is to say, such an electrical signal can properly enter the ions through

1613
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
ions are generated inside

1614
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,600
As for the very detailed

1615
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,400
Very detailed Mechanism

1616
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,600
In fact, we have until now

1617
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,200
We are still looking for

1618
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,200
How to do such an experiment

1619
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,400
But in the early days of this

1620
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,000
in the design of a so-called platform

1621
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,400
We've seen very, very good results

1622
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,000
Of course this thing is just us

1623
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,600
small step

1624
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,600
We also did a series of

1625
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,800
New things

1626
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,400
include us

1627
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,400
So this thing is in

1628
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,400
most importantly

1629
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,000
we are at

1630
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,200
We can use this cell membrane

1631
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,600
for electrical stimulation

1632
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,200
Application of so-called electrostimulatory cell engineering

1633
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,200
We hope that in the future we can use it to make

1634
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,200
The so-called electrical spine

1635
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,700
Neuroelectric spines can stimulate nerve growth

1636
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:49,700
Today if there is an unfortunate patient who has the so-called

1637
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,600
The so-called spinal injury

1638
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,100
or when there is an acute need

1639
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,900
we need to be able to help them

1640
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:57,600
Can stimulate the growth of electric cells

1641
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,600
But it's still early

1642
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,600
Just reached the cell level

1643
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,600
Cell Hierarchy

1644
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,800
not only

1645
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,600
I give this example

1646
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,400
In fact, let everyone know

1647
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,300
Such a simple and deceptively simple result

1648
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,300
Contains three parts

1649
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,600
Contains our molecular design above

1650
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,400
Include you want to design a

1651
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,900
so-called components

1652
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,400
This is of course not an electronic component

1653
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,700
But the simplest element

1654
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,900
We have two electrodes here

1655
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,700
Between the two electrodes there is a

1656
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,000
there is a get

1657
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
this get

1658
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,300
cause we can add 4 plus voltage

1659
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:37,000
On a simple cell like this

1660
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,400
So we have a simple electrode design

1661
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,200
But you have to have elements like this

1662
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,600
It stimulates the growth of cells

1663
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,900
Which means you need to have a variety of people

1664
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,900
And then finally you have to be able to analyze the results of the cells

1665
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,100
That

1666
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,100
I just had a little time to introduce a

1667
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,100
different

1668
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,080
An idea that I researched, I would like to share with you

1669
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,040
That is to say, our other piece

1670
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,680
what we are doing is called

1671
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,080
so-called smart material

1672
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:13,040
Of course every time I talk about wisdom material

1673
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,040
will want

1674
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,160
In particular, we will put our own laboratory

1675
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,160
Organic Smart Materials Laboratory

1676
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,760
of course there is always someone

1677
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,200
Especially some students may come to me and say

1678
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,040
Teacher, I'm not smart enough, can I come in?

1679
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,360
then i can only say

1680
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,520
he

1681
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,400
right

1682
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,560
he is smart

1683
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,680
he's smart

1684
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,680
us

1685
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,360
As long as everyone works hard

1686
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,360
don't need to be smart

1687
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,560
We are all about designing smart materials

1688
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,960
to help our underserved humans

1689
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,920
So what we call smart material

1690
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:45,880
let me introduce you a little bit

1691
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,560
smart material that is

1692
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,560
you

1693
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,280
In fact, the human body

1694
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,720
In the human body we have a variety of materials

1695
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,960
The material of the human body is actually a smart material

1696
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,600
for example very simple

1697
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,840
when you are attacked by an

1698
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,500
will naturally fight back

1699
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
when you get a stimulus

1700
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,500
your body will go naturally

1701
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,000
elicit a series of subsequent responses

1702
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
cause the body to be protected

1703
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
no harm, right?

1704
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,500
the human body is simple

1705
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,500
If you come alone with your fist

1706
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,500
you will hide

1707
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,000
you can't hide

1708
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,500
Because this is a natural intelligent response of the human body

1709
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,500
So the so-called wisdom will be the same

1710
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,000
That is to say, when we are stimulated by an external

1711
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
it will generate form

1712
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
or various changes

1713
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
so it can respond to

1714
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
It can produce a different state

1715
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,500
The stimuli generated by this include a variety of

1716
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:42,500
There are so-called physical stimuli

1717
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,000
Contains temperature light

1718
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
even magnetic fields, electric fields

1719
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,500
chemical stimulation

1720
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,000
Contains pH

1721
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Contains electrochemical reactions

1722
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,500
Contains even your tolerance to change it

1723
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,500
change it this organic this

1724
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,500
change it to this

1725
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,760
change its volume or receptor

1726
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,440
Biological words contain the simplest is

1727
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,440
If your blood sugar is too high today

1728
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,120
you naturally secrete insulin

1729
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,200
This contains what is called a sugar stimulus

1730
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,320
Contains even an enzyme stimulating

1731
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:18,440
Of course it also contains some

1732
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,280
Simple stimulation of a receptor and carrier

1733
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,560
it's all possible

1734
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,800
Then we do a very simple experiment

1735
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,520
We designed another molecule

1736
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,640
You don't have to worry about what the molecule looks like

1737
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,760
You just need to know what the molecule can do

1738
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:36,560
After this molecule is oxidized

1739
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,840
can make a cell or a protein

1740
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,840
Connected to this oxidized shutdown group

1741
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,040
Then whenever restore

1742
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,720
The cell or the functional group will leave

1743
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,160
So we did a very simple experiment

1744
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,400
This is two sets of electrodes

1745
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,000
If we only oxidize

1746
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:07,300
For electrode 1, only electrode 1 will be connected to something

1747
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,000
Here we are very simple, we use a green dye

1748
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,900
So we only oxidize electrode 1, there will be green on the electrode

1749
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:20,000
If we oxidize electrode 1 and electrode 2, there will be green on both electrode 1 and electrode 2

1750
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
If we only restore electrode 2 at this time, only the green on electrode 2 will run away

1751
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,300
That is, this is one, I just mentioned to you

1752
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:32,300
An organism is a dynamic system

1753
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:37,300
In other words, we now also have a dynamic system to match the dynamic system of organisms

1754
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:42,300
We hope this will help the organism to do something

1755
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:49,300
We do simple things that are actually very intuitive

1756
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:59,300
Let's just say that after we increase the cells through the TV

1757
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,440
Everyone, I have done cell experiments

1758
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:07,680
In fact, you may also know that there is a problem with the cells, the cells are very, very

1759
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,000
Some cells are very sticky

1760
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,120
like sticking to a surface

1761
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,080
Then you want to remove the cells from this surface

1762
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,560
For example, today I

1763
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,440
Say it like this

1764
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,880
For example, today I

1765
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,920
I want to transplant this cell

1766
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,520
from a thing

1767
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,560
port to something else

1768
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,440
like today

1769
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,360
your

1770
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:29,880
Now there are many so-called stem cell therapeutics

1771
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,760
therapy

1772
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,560
that is

1773
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,160
I use your stem cells

1774
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,160
After protruding a layer of cornea

1775
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:36,560
the cornea

1776
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,800
must

1777
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,200
After being raised outside the body

1778
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,480
must be transplanted back

1779
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,560
on your eyes

1780
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,840
your eyes are useful

1781
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,000
but

1782
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,080
Many times on the surface of in vitro cultures

1783
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,360
it's very, very sticky

1784
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:51,960
if we don't do some

1785
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,040
so-called smart materials

1786
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,720
In that case, we can only scrape it with all our strength.

1787
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,720
Then when you scrape it with all your strength

1788
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,120
cells will be lost

1789
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,400
it won't come out nicely from the surface

1790
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,200
Does this mean that everyone has been injured?

1791
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,700
If it's actually a bad habit of mine

1792
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,700
When you get hurt, when you see a scar, you want to pick it

1793
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,700
It will bleed again after picking

1794
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,400
this is such a concept

1795
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,100
Today if the cells have grown

1796
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,500
I use Mechanical 4 to use mechanical power

1797
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,200
when to dig it up

1798
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,400
its cells get hurt

1799
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,300
then it won't work well

1800
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,900
If we use a fun

1801
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,900
we use a

1802
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,900
Let's say we use heat-reactive stuff

1803
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,300
We just take an ice cube and put it on

1804
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,900
Now there are many new generation tapes that are heat reactive

1805
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:45,100
For example, if you blow it with a hair dryer

1806
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,300
it has no glue residue

1807
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,600
That is, in cases like this

1808
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,100
We can achieve the situation of no residual glue

1809
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,500
so i want to tell you

1810
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,800
We also use this situation

1811
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,200
We are at this time under the method of telephone learning

1812
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:58,800
We can make this layer of cells can leave the surface

1813
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,300
We can detect this cell

1814
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,500
still alive very very well

1815
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,800
OK, this last two

1816
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,600
Two is one of our simple

1817
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,100
Share it with everyone

1818
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,400
Experimental results in our own laboratory

1819
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,100
Of course such an experiment

1820
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,700
away from real commercial applications

1821
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,800
Or the application of future technology?

1822
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,600
still have a very long distance

1823
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,800
but we believe

1824
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,100
The whole thread of science should be

1825
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,100
we should be

1826
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,400
Study science with curiosity

1827
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,900
what about science

1828
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:33,000
New Science

1829
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,100
Will lead to new technology

1830
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,200
new technology

1831
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,200
will lead new industries

1832
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,700
The new industry will generate a new economy

1833
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,600
Then such words

1834
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,900
This is the correct context

1835
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,300
and we don't need to say

1836
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,800
I have to take care of myself

1837
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,200
We actually focus on the front end

1838
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,200
We want to do the best science

1839
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,600
hope this will

1840
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,300
can help everyone

1841
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,300
then i last

1842
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,000
make a brief summary

1843
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,200
uh, this is not actually a summary

1844
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I conclude that I put a picture just to tell everyone that this is something that our laboratory is doing

1845
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Actually quite a lot

1846
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Then I hope that today's speech can make everyone understand the organic bioelectronic components

1847
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I think it's a new field

1848
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
But why do I think it's new?

1849
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Because sometimes I feel lonely

1850
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
because we did it for 10 years

1851
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
It seems that there are still not many people doing it

1852
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
So we think maybe when we sometimes wonder if it's

1853
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
because it's worthless

1854
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But I think we most want to do this 10 years

1855
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
We think this is a very interesting field

1856
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And he and we are on this land

1857
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I think there is a fate that is closely related

1858
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Because I think he has a very close connection with our current electronics industry

1859
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
if there is a chance

1860
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
This is the ability to continue to the technical level

1861
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Even to the industrial level

1862
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
that is our own hope

1863
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Then our specialty is material design including molecular design

1864
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,820
Hope to end up with some new apps

1865
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,840
and new ways to help people

1866
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,980
whether in biomedicine

1867
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:13,320
Sometimes we also do some research on energy

1868
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,360
Hope this can help you too

1869
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,400
That's it, thank you all

1870
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,320
right now we

1871
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,920
Thank you Dr. You for your wonderful speech

1872
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,480
So we probably still have

1873
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,300
i think almost 40 minutes

1874
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,860
you can ask some questions

1875
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:37,880
there is one here

1876
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,420
ask the professor

1877
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:43,260
The neurostimulation electric shock that the professor just mentioned

1878
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,300
later can

1879
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,640
treat that

1880
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,700
Are you doing martial arts?

1881
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,780
How long do you have to wait?

1882
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,340
because my newcomer has many

1883
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:59,900
have this symptom

1884
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Um

1885
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,740
The question is

1886
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,400
As for the problem of bone nerves, this is actually

1887
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:12,140
What we are doing now is actually very advanced

1888
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,040
That is, we are still making cells, we have not yet made relics

1889
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,080
I haven't done the straight road yet, but what you said is the so-called bone nerve stimulation

1890
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:23,420
In fact, some people have already started to use bioelectrodes to do this.

1891
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,420
actually

1892
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,820
me, everyone can go

1893
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,660
maybe try to

1894
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,680
What I just said, the so-called things like RoboCop

1895
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,180
It's not impossible anymore

1896
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:35,680
in America , in Australia

1897
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,360
There are already a lot of people who are already doing something like this

1898
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,560
included in the usa

1899
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:44,220
There are some, you can find some so-called videos on YouTube

1900
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,320
Is someone already, for example, after he installed the legacy

1901
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,560
He can come out with electrodes, he uses the signals from his brain

1902
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,660
Directly control the walking of this foot

1903
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,960
He doesn't need to go through a mechanical principle

1904
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,100
just don't need crutches

1905
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,260
Instead, directly use your brain waves to control

1906
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,500
Control the walking of this foot

1907
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:03,080
on the other hand

1908
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,940
It has nothing to do with the comparison of the five nerves.

1909
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:05,960
In Australia

1910
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,640
They do what's called an inner ear transplant

1911
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,440
They use inner ear transplants

1912
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,760
Such neuroelectric ridges

1913
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,040
can stimulate

1914
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,600
hearing recovery

1915
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,940
This experiment has been at least

1916
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,380
What I saw last

1917
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,200
At least 30,000 people have been transplanted like this

1918
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,380
A test of a so-called electrical spine for inner ear transplantation

1919
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:26,540
So these things are already being done

1920
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,300
that just means

1921
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,960
words on the hospital side

1922
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,060
i have some nerves

1923
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,740
The surgeon has talked

1924
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:36,740
that is

1925
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:37,820
on the one hand

1926
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,260
Does the patient need it?

1927
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,260
on the one hand

1928
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:41,460
can we do it

1929
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,020
Then the doctor can't do it

1930
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:43,460
This is

1931
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,980
we talk all the time

1932
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,780
Is it possible for something like this

1933
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:48,460
Of course, it is not limited to doing ancient nerves.

1934
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:51,100
and many other things

1935
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,020
How about that effect?

1936
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:54,620
I didn't do it when I was a kid

1937
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,540
have not do yet

1938
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:56,380
because they haven't done it yet

1939
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,460
still too early

1940
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,060
because it's still a little early

1941
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:00,060
that's it

1942
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,800
Because we're not doctors after all

1943
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,920
So many times we don't

1944
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:08,760
we sometimes talk to the doctor

1945
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,560
This is how cross-lingual cooperation looks like

1946
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,720
we work with doctors

1947
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,440
The doctor told us about the difficulties he faced

1948
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,800
Let's look at it from a scientist's point of view

1949
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,520
From a technical point of view

1950
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,840
what can we do with them

1951
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,840
So I think for patients

1952
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,840
I think the best channel of communication

1953
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,960
still a doctor

1954
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,360
because the doctor is a bridge

1955
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,520
he can talk to us

1956
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,080
talk to patients

1957
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,360
So the doctor will compare

1958
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,160
The doctor actually knows best, I think

1959
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,920
I still think the doctor knows best

1960
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,280
Thanks

1961
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,720
ok here

1962
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,600
Teacher Yu, let me ask

1963
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,680
You just mentioned that when the power is on

1964
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,480
Cells can be detached from surfaces

1965
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,800
That's the surface of dealing with that culture name

1966
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,080
or processing cell membranes

1967
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,120
surface of the name

1968
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,220
The surface is just adding and coating or what?

1969
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,620
Yes, such a surface is the surface of our electrode

1970
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:11,840
Just add a coating of the conductive material we just made like this

1971
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,720
So we can make it from the surface of this material

1972
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,500
make a proper disengagement

1973
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,540
So you just mentioned that corner ink may be a medical material or something.

1974
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:25,080
Jiaomo is another direction, but I know the direction

1975
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,120
However, when cells are cultured

1976
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:30,120
It was necessary to take the cells out of the cultured cotton

1977
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:31,560
to do splitting or something

1978
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,520
so this kind of look you cotton

1979
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,240
Should be pretty close to the application angle

1980
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,460
That is to say, it can be used in general cultured cells

1981
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,420
That's right, it can be used for general cultured cells

1982
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:47,160
But on the other hand, generally cultured cells

1983
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,360
Because what you said is right

1984
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,720
That is to say, it can be used, but it depends on whether the cells need it

1985
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:54,880
Some cells do not need

1986
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,880
Because traditional biochemical technology they, for example,

1987
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,880
by

1988
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,240
Add the cell membrane protein degrading enzyme Tripsin

1989
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,440
They use this to help it get off the surface

1990
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,940
but in that case

1991
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:11,940
It is said to be toxic to certain cells

1992
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:14,440
So really looking at the cells

1993
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,740
if the cells need it

1994
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:18,240
In fact, such technologies already exist.

1995
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:20,440
I believe that there are experience or people in use

1996
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:24,640
The most common one is actually not the electrical stimulation we are talking about now.

1997
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,140
but thermal reactivity

1998
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:29,940
We are also doing thermal reactions

1999
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:33,780
there is a certain type of material

2000
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:36,780
It doesn't stick to cells when it's on ice

2001
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,540
sticky cells when hot

2002
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:42,340
This material is actually already sitting on the cornea

2003
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:45,380
Even sitting on the repair of cardiomyocytes

2004
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,880
research in this area

2005
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,880
It is already being done in Japan and Europe

2006
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,000
It uses this type of

2007
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,180
so-called smart material

2008
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:56,000
But the heat response is exhausted and it is already being done

2009
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,180
Common cells are paired with few people who use this

2010
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,380
at least i haven't heard of it

2011
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:00,380
yes it can

2012
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,960
Because I think maybe on the one hand

2013
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,960
Is there a need

2014
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,260
on the one hand

2015
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,260
Then on the one hand is the price

2016
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:13,660
hello doc

2017
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,360
thank you for your excellent speech

2018
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,760
I am Jianfu

2019
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,960
I want to ask

2020
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:21,560
Just had an experiment with P.DOT

2021
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,260
It has a potential

2022
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:24,660
With battery

2023
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,200
One is pure P.DOT

2024
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,800
There is another material

2025
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,000
You mentioned that it's neurological growth

2026
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,460
Probably can be long now

2027
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,960
About 2.5 times a speed

2028
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,800
I want to ask

2029
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,600
P.DOT is in the process of applying voltage

2030
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,660
the directionality of its current

2031
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:47,960
can be clearly located

2032
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,300
if its directionality

2033
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,000
can be located

2034
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,860
that neuronal outgrowth

2035
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:57,160
It is divided into S-Long and Dentrix

2036
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,020
the length of its growth

2037
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,240
Is it possible to analyze the direction of his electrical stimulation?

2038
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:08,360
If there is a positive correlation between them in terms of angle

2039
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:13,000
Maybe for the future judgment on potential and its directionality

2040
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,880
And because we know that our creatures actually have a lot of traps on the surface

2041
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,160
It forms the potential area is a comprehensive effect of clustering

2042
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:26,240
But our biology actually tries to bring our body into balance

2043
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:30,960
So its mill actually has a microcirculation magnetic field in the

2044
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:36,000
Maybe this material has a magnetic field for the microcirculation of the mill

2045
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It can go to locate further things

2046
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,840
Will that affect the direction of our future nerve growth?

2047
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,560
and the direction of its stimulus

2048
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:48,400
Or even it pulses as often as it should

2049
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,440
The difference between the speed of change of its ions

2050
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,800
Implementing the diff might help

2051
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:58,960
This question is really too professional

2052
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,260
I say this question is very good

2053
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:05,460
This is the question we all ask ourselves

2054
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:09,260
That is to say, this is actually one of our current research directions.

2055
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:12,760
but i want to be here

2056
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,160
I always have to keep an open mind

2057
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:19,360
That is to say, there is a problem with what we are doing is that

2058
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,560
can we do

2059
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,760
If you are interested we can always cooperate

2060
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,660
In fact, our biggest problem is to say

2061
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,760
We don't understand anything about the so-called electrophysiological

2062
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,780
this part

2063
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:32,980
That is to say, I will show you the result today.

2064
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:36,580
is an actually a very, very, very early result

2065
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,280
we just do one thing

2066
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,280
let's go see

2067
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,120
A chemist's point of view

2068
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,380
Watch us change the chemical structure

2069
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:47,680
To simulate the structure of the cell membrane

2070
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,420
How would it alter the growth of the cells

2071
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:52,820
But the tiny part contains say

2072
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:54,320
power plant

2073
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:55,880
electric current

2074
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,920
electric potential

2075
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:00,080
Even the micro current generated by the power plant

2076
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,900
or the magnetic fields generated by power plants

2077
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,340
is there any way to change

2078
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:07,000
Go polar wise the growth of these cells

2079
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,500
Actually we really want to do

2080
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,600
But we are still working on

2081
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,500
how are we going to do this experiment

2082
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,200
that is how we go

2083
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,000
How do we design this device

2084
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,500
Let it produce the direction of a current we want

2085
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,900
In fact, even we are curious

2086
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:25,500
because what i'm going to say is

2087
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,700
I mean it from the bottom of my heart

2088
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,300
which means we're really, really curious

2089
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,400
we've always wanted to do

2090
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:34,800
But it seems that there is still a lack of knowledge

2091
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,100
Still looking for how to do this experiment

2092
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,100
right

2093
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:41,100
Thank you very much

2094
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:45,600
I hope more people can benefit from this

2095
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,300
we would love to do

2096
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,100
because this also goes on to what's called cellular physiology

2097
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,000
or cell electronics

2098
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,300
Then we need or need more people

2099
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,000
let us know tell us teach

2100
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,600
roughly how to do this kind of experiment

2101
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,900
We are now simply using

2102
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,540
The simplest way is to look at how a cell needs to be done from a chemical point of view.

2103
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:05,840
Thanks

2104
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,340
right

2105
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,040
Does he have

2106
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:10,940
ok, there is

2107
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:12,740
Yes, because it happens to be

2108
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,940
I'm Dr. You's college classmate

2109
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:19,680
He just said that all college students have joined TSMC

2110
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,680
That Fengqiao is the only one present today

2111
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,880
I just happened to be the one who didn't get into TSMC

2112
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,080
So when he said that just now, he still felt hot on his face.

2113
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,680
as if talking about my feelings

2114
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:29,680
like this

2115
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,440
Because that said there is still a major problem

2116
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,420
Like the teacher’s first question just now, how can this thing be done?

2117
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,620
because I've actually been posting the door for a while

2118
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,080
Then we are probably more in the industry

2119
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,080
As far as the most feared issue is to say

2120
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,820
you may do well in the lab

2121
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,380
when he started to enter Pirom

2122
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,380
The trader will tell you that he can't do it

2123
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,280
Or when this thing is made

2124
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,580
He's going to give it to a patient.

2125
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:56,080
The patient basically

2126
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,480
Unless your thing is a very clear health insurance payment

2127
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,480
But we know we've heard that health insurance is about to break

2128
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
bankrupted

2129
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,200
It's very likely

2130
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,600
So the first question is to say

2131
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,600
this thing

2132
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,000
probably first thing

2133
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,300
because basically

2134
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,700
What Dr. Post is doing in his lab now

2135
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,200
You have been doing it for ten years

2136
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,700
So the first of your industry's

2137
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:14,300
who this corporator might be

2138
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,100
Under what circumstances are you prepared to count the turn

2139
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,300
And you start getting closer to maturity

2140
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,200
You'll be thinking about mass production versus actual

2141
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,400
The question of the cost of being able to do this

2142
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,600
because I feel

2143
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,300
What Dr. Post just mentioned

2144
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,600
Obviously not just in Science

2145
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,300
or what Pay

2146
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,100
Send a Paper on Science Network

2147
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:29,900
the point is to say

2148
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,200
When can he really form an industry

2149
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,900
He can really use it in

2150
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,100
on people who need it

2151
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,000
So what you just said

2152
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,900
doctor's part

2153
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:40,500
I feel like jumping a little faster

2154
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,200
The first thing to get lucky is

2155
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,900
Who can mass-produce this thing

2156
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,800
So your skill amount is

2157
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,300
who will do it first

2158
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:48,500
I think this is probably the most important

2159
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,000
Because of this consideration

2160
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,300
just a little less

2161
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,400
How do you industrialize these

2162
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,900
what is your idea

2163
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:56,000
ok

2164
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,300
this

2165
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,200
I think

2166
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
classmate

2167
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
no no no i just

2168
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
just say hello

2169
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I think this part is actually

2170
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:19,000
In fact, my personal energy is actually quite complicated.

2171
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I think Zhou Fu just introduced some

2172
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
If I introduce myself, I actually

2173
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Like what they said about me returning home

2174
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I feel like a wandering professor

2175
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Because the highest record of this

2176
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
During my eight years with my wife

2177
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
changed four countries

2178
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
and moved seven times

2179
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
sister will move

2180
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Then I actually know how to set up the laboratory

2181
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Because I often move labs

2182
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
so off topic

2183
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
In fact, when I just graduated from PhD

2184
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I have had conflicts

2185
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I have thought about what I want to do in the future

2186
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So actually I also have

2187
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I have talked to VC

2188
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I also talked to the industry

2189
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I actually

2190
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
interviewed the industry

2191
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I also interviewed G Plastic

2192
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I even interviewed McKenzie

2193
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
McKenzie Consulting Firm

2194
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So actually I probably

2195
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I probably understand what you're talking about

2196
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
In fact, it's all very specialized.

2197
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
The point is you have to find

2198
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
For me I think the key is you find the right person to help you

2199
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
You need to find the right partner to help you

2200
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
because no one person can do everything

2201
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I have no choice now

2202
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
answer this question positively

2203
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
I don't have a partner to help me now

2204
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
The second is that I don't have any

2205
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Our thing is actually for me

2206
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I think the biggest problem is

2207
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
The first question just asked is very good

2208
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
which problem we can solve

2209
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Because what I'm offering now is a platform

2210
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Platforms have the potential to solve many problems

2211
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
but to put it bluntly

2212
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
you didn't solve any problems

2213
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
For example, the first question

2214
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,860
Another example, since organic bioelectronics is an emerging field

2215
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:09,700
So I don't know, organic electronics in the organic electronics industry

2216
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:12,900
All of your animations have gone through

2217
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:18,400
Because of organic electronics, organic electronics just means that organic matter can emit light and generate electricity

2218
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,600
Conducts electricity, but how does it become a product?

2219
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,200
I don't know, so the first product is called OLED

2220
01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:28,800
The second product is called OTFT, but OTFT is dead

2221
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,700
OTFT has been beaten to death by GRAPHIN

2222
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,200
was beaten to death by Deputy Zhou

2223
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,900
OTFT has been beaten to death by GRAPHIN

2224
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,600
Then OLED, the second is OLED

2225
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,200
Next up now is OPV

2226
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,000
this is what everyone is doing

2227
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,700
But in the industry, in fact, sometimes we talk to business people

2228
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,400
The business world actually cares just to say

2229
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,000
In fact, to put it simply, it is a popular saying in the past.

2230
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,600
black cat, white cat, whatever your cat is

2231
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,900
A cat that catches mice is a good cat

2232
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:00,200
TV is TV

2233
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
From a

2234
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
from the customer's point of view

2235
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
He doesn't care at all it's an OLED TV

2236
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
This is an LCD TV

2237
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
This is CRD TV

2238
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
what he wants is this thing

2239
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Performance

2240
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
So what we have to know now is

2241
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
identify where is the problem

2242
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
For example, heavy femoral nerve is a problem

2243
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
This platform can solve

2244
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Then this part we have to go through the doctor

2245
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Because only a doctor can tell us

2246
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
this problem

2247
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Is it possible for our platform to solve

2248
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
So the first step I think we still have to cooperate with the doctor

2249
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
academically

2250
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Because academically you have not solved

2251
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Before determining what problems you can solve

2252
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Let's talk about mass production first

2253
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
the first is

2254
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
no one will

2255
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Talk to you about mass production

2256
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
because you can't go without him

2257
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Predict where your market is

2258
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
where is your market

2259
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
The second question is

2260
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
he is not willing

2261
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
risk him

2262
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
In this respect, I believe

2263
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,020
I'm sorry I talked a little bit more

2264
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:04,660
Because I actually have quite a lot of experience

2265
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,260
that is to say in the United States

2266
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:08,400
They use the so-called SBIR System

2267
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,560
Lets you teach yourself how to start a company

2268
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,400
go after your dreams

2269
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:15,040
So this is actually for me

2270
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,960
I think it's a good

2271
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:18,240
So Taiwan also has the SBIR System

2272
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,900
So instead of such a

2273
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:20,960
that is

2274
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:23,940
SBIR is a small company that invites professors

2275
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,360
put his help to this small company

2276
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:29,000
Just cooperate with his students to do a simple calculation

2277
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,200
That actually still uses Science

2278
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,140
Or a way for Technology to Push

2279
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,440
In fact, there are different models of development companies

2280
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,560
I don't think it's too early to go now

2281
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:42,940
identify partner

2282
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:43,840
but i think

2283
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,940
Our biggest problem right now is

2284
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,560
identify where is the question

2285
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:48,900
is where is the question

2286
01:30:48,900 --> 01:30:51,000
If so, we can use this platform

2287
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,140
Questions that can help

2288
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:56,740
We are actually cooperating with many hospitals now

2289
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:57,860
go in a different direction

2290
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:00,060
But I'm sorry we're not doing stock gods

2291
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
but we do something else

2292
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Because I didn't talk about our other topic today

2293
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
In fact, I am very passionate about this topic.

2294
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
But we have some other research topics that are

2295
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I was talking to the hospital, I actually got into it

2296
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Nearly doing a stage of Proven Solving

2297
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
But we are not doing Proven Solving now

2298
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,000
On this platform, we are just doing a pure academic discussion

2299
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I don't think we have reached the stage of Proven Solving now

2300
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
but we are

2301
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
right

2302
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
so i'm here i can't tell you

2303
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
which one are we now

2304
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
There's no way to tell you how we're going to have one

2305
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
It's a business plan

2306
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
a business plan

2307
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
just don't know where the problem is

2308
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I think the question is very important

2309
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
you need to know where your problem is

2310
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Let me ask you this

2311
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
This New Rain will Out-Growth

2312
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
president so much

2313
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Then he obviously has the expression of stimulating a certain gene.

2314
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,600
So have you researched the expression of those genes?

2315
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,400
The reason I say this now is because

2316
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,840
Because you are all talking about medicine now

2317
01:32:08,840 --> 01:32:11,020
In fact, Taiwan's biotechnology is still in the medical field

2318
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:12,120
because my face

2319
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,820
Taiwan's laws and regulations are considered a bit too strict in the world

2320
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:18,020
so sometimes it can be a bit difficult

2321
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:21,920
But some biotechnology is not necessarily directly related to medicine

2322
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,320
In fact, it might be faster to walk.

2323
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:28,320
Like this, if you use electrodes to stimulate cells

2324
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,920
you talk about nerves now

2325
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,720
But say something about the cells

2326
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,620
Because now Taiwan uses cells to produce protein

2327
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:37,120
For example, the production of vaccines

2328
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,720
or produce some therapeutic proteins

2329
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,820
or therapeutic antibodies

2330
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,060
In fact, the demand is quite high

2331
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:48,040
If your electrode stimulation can promote the expression of certain genes

2332
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,900
Software can make the protein of a certain feature

2333
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:54,180
Or genetically engineered proteins can be produced in large quantities

2334
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,040
I look back now to say

2335
01:32:56,060 --> 01:32:58,740
Because what you see now is Alkose of cells

2336
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,180
A bunch behind Alkose

2337
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,740
There must be a large number of expression of genes

2338
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:04,700
If the performance can be stimulated by this electric shock

2339
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,140
Maybe it's another way

2340
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:08,640
It doesn't have to be superficial

2341
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,640
this and that

2342
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:11,640
very considerate

2343
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:12,440
I know

2344
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,940
thank you very much for this

2345
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,540
This is actually a question I just answered

2346
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,940
we need to know

2347
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:21,140
where are the possibilities

2348
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:23,640
This actually gives us a very good suggestion that

2349
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,440
it may be a possibility

2350
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,640
then i

2351
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:27,640
i'm sorry

2352
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,640
I didn't make this truth very clear.

2353
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,640
on this side

2354
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,140
rightmost image

2355
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,640
In fact, in addition to stimulating cell growth, our TV sets

2356
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:37,640
because at that time hair

2357
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,640
To be honest it was because at that time

2358
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,640
When you want to submit a question here

2359
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,640
that

2360
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:47,640
Censor says you can't just demo water your TV cell growth

2361
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,640
You want demo water the second thing

2362
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:51,640
So without demo water the second thing is

2363
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,640
It electrically stimulates protein secretion

2364
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:55,640
This protein is actually New on Gross Factor

2365
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:56,640
it is at

2366
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,640
Everyone I have studied New on Gross Factor

2367
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,640
New on Gross Factor

2368
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,400
The general New Long Long also has something called Shuang Cell

2369
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,400
It is used to protect the cells of New Long

2370
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,100
It itself secretes New Long Gloss Factor

2371
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,100
Will help the New Long inside grow

2372
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:12,100
when we discovered the world of television

2373
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:14,600
Not only does it stimulate the growth of cells inside

2374
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,600
It also irritates the outer protective membrane

2375
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:18,600
To secrete more New Long Gloss Factor

2376
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,600
I believe

2377
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,600
you are right

2378
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,100
what is the first DNA

2379
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,600
Actually more basic

2380
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:26,600
we are doing now

2381
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,100
What exactly is Pathway

2382
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:29,900
Which Pathway is it?

2383
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:32,900
Because of

2384
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,900
Adhesion Induced Pathway

2385
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,900
Or does it have another Pathway

2386
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,900
we just did

2387
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:41,900
We just did a little bit of proof

2388
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:42,900
we did an experiment

2389
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:43,900
we prove that

2390
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,900
It has nothing to do with Adhesion

2391
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,900
because when we use a drug

2392
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:51,900
When living in the Adhesion Receptor Pathway Block

2393
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,900
TV still stimulates cell growth

2394
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,900
So the Machining of the TV

2395
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:57,900
Growth-stimulating Machining

2396
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,900
Pathway's Adhesion has nothing to do with it

2397
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,200
We have done this experiment

2398
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:03,120
because we didn't show it here

2399
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:05,120
But we have done this experiment

2400
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,600
so i want your suggestion

2401
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,520
It's really precious, it's really nice

2402
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,320
I do

2403
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,440
If there is an actual

2404
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:14,960
direction what we can do

2405
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,320
we can also discuss

2406
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,320
because I've always felt that

2407
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,760
That's right, just say

2408
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,840
It's like I just re-emphasized to you

2409
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,200
this is a platform

2410
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,200
We have many possibilities

2411
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,680
In fact, I should think

2412
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,920
Because I told you this experiment arranged your experiment

2413
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,960
So you should be worth analyzing that transcript

2414
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,480
is all transcription

2415
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,320
It can be produced under the tube type

2416
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:37,360
can you find it out

2417
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,680
So which specific genes are overexpressed?

2418
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,000
With and without batteries

2419
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,520
you can compare

2420
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:46,160
If you compare, you will know which type of promoter

2421
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,000
may be particularly stimulated

2422
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,160
So that place is a

2423
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,160
specific research pathway

2424
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,000
Thanks

2425
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,800
Thanks

2426
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,680
Thanks

2427
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,680
Thanks

2428
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,880
today

2429
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
i didn't hear very clearly

2430
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:07,000
My guess is you tried Top Down

2431
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
do bionics again

2432
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Do Modern Design again

2433
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Top Down

2434
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Top Down

2435
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
is you now identify the problem

2436
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Then analyze the mechanism inside

2437
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
The basic elements inside

2438
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Now many are button up

2439
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
button up can't go far

2440
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Especially if you want to do Bio-Memetic

2441
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
May have to do Top Down

2442
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
ok

2443
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Thanks

2444
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
actually for me

2445
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I am not very sure

2446
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
sorry

2447
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
For me, Top Down and bottom up are Nano Science

2448
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
For me those two words are Nano Science

2449
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
we are using

2450
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
but it doesn't matter

2451
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I probably know what you mean

2452
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
i want to be in bio

2453
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
I think it's also possible that everyone knows

2454
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
everyone may do too

2455
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
There are many ancestors who are living creatures who know that

2456
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,260
The biggest problem with being a creature is that you have to identify the waste problem

2457
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,740
So all I can say is we have the system now

2458
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,640
Then our system we Demonstrate a problem that is

2459
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,340
In fact, electromechanical cell growth

2460
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,280
how to make it faster

2461
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,780
this we did now

2462
01:37:14,780 --> 01:37:18,740
Then we can do it by changing the molecular structure

2463
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,240
that if

2464
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,440
Do you think this is called top down

2465
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,240
Then I think it is top down

2466
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:26,340
Because I'm actually not sure if this is called top down

2467
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,640
but it does

2468
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:30,240
Toggy or question is whether there is a problem

2469
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,800
Then how do we solve it

2470
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,100
i think this is

2471
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,640
what we do all the time

2472
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,640
hope to be able to do

2473
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,900
The button up of Top down is on that

2474
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:38,100
Nanotechnology

2475
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:38,900
is a very ordinary management

2476
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:40,900
Yeah

2477
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:43,340
It's top down, it's resography

2478
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,940
button up is self assembly

2479
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:47,340
For us, top down is resography

2480
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:48,340
then my simplest

2481
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:50,240
i will sit on the plane

2482
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,940
I will divide it on the top down

2483
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:53,840
Molecule atoms made later

2484
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,940
Button up is done from the molecular atom to the top

2485
01:37:55,940 --> 01:37:56,740
OK

2486
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
OK, is there any more?

2487
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
well behind

2488
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Hello doctor, I am a college student in the Department of Biotechnology

2489
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:20,000
That may not work, the problem may not be so professional theory

2490
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Yes, then what I want to ask is because your experiment is about electrical stimulation of cells

2491
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
The Xianbai just now also mentioned that because it stimulates cell growth

2492
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
We know that there may be many proteins in the cell

2493
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,000
So can we just focus on certain proteins

2494
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,000
or destimulate on certain transfer factors

2495
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Or send out some message for the receptors to pick up

2496
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
thereby deactivating those proteases and the like

2497
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Yes, maybe, not the whole cell

2498
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Maybe it's part of the genes or something like the uprightness of the cells

2499
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
It can be stimulated without shortening too quickly

2500
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
or

2501
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,440
to enable the cell to prolong its lifespan and things like that

2502
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:05,560
That is, the possible research directions are more professional and more

2503
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:07,300
The range is a bit smaller, but not that big

2504
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,940
Just let the cells grow

2505
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,900
Is it possible to do research on this

2506
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:16,400
That question is actually very good

2507
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,060
Don't worry

2508
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,400
because we are here

2509
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,900
Just to share with you our experiments

2510
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,260
what you just said

2511
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,100
absolutely right

2512
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,200
because in fact

2513
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,600
The simplest matter of light cell growth

2514
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,760
actually a

2515
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,200
in biomedicine

2516
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,360
actually a very important thing

2517
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,760
Because actually I

2518
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,800
Although protein analysis

2519
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,100
do genetic analysis

2520
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:45,000
It is very important in education

2521
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,400
It is also very, very necessary to understand

2522
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,800
Because knowing why is not just because

2523
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,260
It's Santific fun

2524
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:51,200
but because

2525
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:53,400
Even if you go into that

2526
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,960
FDA

2527
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:57,520
Even at the legal level

2528
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,860
he needs you to know too

2529
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,600
What is the mechanism behind any drug or device

2530
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,160
This is the pharmacological mechanism must be known

2531
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:09,160
so it's all important

2532
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,520
But I think one of the things we do is

2533
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,200
What we often do is say

2534
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,040
we also want to say see

2535
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,320
electrical stimulation

2536
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,600
Surface-bound receptor stimulation

2537
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,560
Stimulation even combined with nanostructures

2538
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:25,360
Can we use the fastest way

2539
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,200
to enhance cell growth

2540
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,920
This is actually very important in biomedicine

2541
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,160
Of course, the reason I say this is because

2542
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:39,760
Actually it has a market over there

2543
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:44,920
Not only in research, you are very happy to save people

2544
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,400
And it does have a market over there

2545
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:50,240
In fact, what many people in this market are doing is

2546
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,160
Includes sports medicine

2547
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:53,760
Sports medicine

2548
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,360
how do you make a person

2549
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,320
today i thought i would give a

2550
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,160
Because today is the enjoyment of knowledge, I will lift it up

2551
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,000
relatively simple

2552
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,100
For example, now the NBA final

2553
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,900
Everyone knows that the NBA is playing the finals now

2554
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:08,600
If today is unlucky

2555
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,400
Lobrom James

2556
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,600
broken foot

2557
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,400
If you can get him back in a week

2558
01:41:15,400 --> 01:41:17,200
can he get you back

2559
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:18,500
1 million US dollars

2560
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,200
he must be willing

2561
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,400
but you have to be good

2562
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,600
that is how we are

2563
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,900
biologically listen to you

2564
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:29,200
If we use these stimuli appropriately

2565
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:31,300
to stimulate cell growth

2566
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:34,000
absolutely very important

2567
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:34,900
so i believe

2568
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,200
what i said to you is not wrong

2569
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:37,200
we have done

2570
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:38,000
we noticed

2571
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Electrical stimulation coupled with stimulation of surface structures

2572
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Both have additive effects

2573
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,300
Can make cells grow faster

2574
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,500
Include

2575
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:48,400
so-called copying

2576
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,800
That is, the speed of proliferation will become faster

2577
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,500
But the proliferation is over

2578
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,000
You have to make sure the cells are all good

2579
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,600
Then we have to do another experiment on this part.

2580
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,900
but i think

2581
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,320
this thing means

2582
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,280
biomedical aspects

2583
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:06,700
bioelectronics

2584
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:09,460
organic bioelectronics

2585
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:12,040
The hardest thing is because you have to integrate

2586
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,000
From Upstream to Downstream Upstream Material Design

2587
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,240
Midstream Engineering Design

2588
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,520
and then to downstream medical applications

2589
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,680
It all comes together so

2590
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:24,880
sometimes we look like we

2591
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,960
We are a little more scattered now, we don’t have folks talking about which parts are done very carefully

2592
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,960
We hope to put such a situation first

2593
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:32,960
were able

2594
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,960
Explain to everyone, you can do a simple Demonstration

2595
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:36,960
in this way

2596
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:40,520
there are still problems

2597
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:43,020
that because i do

2598
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:46,020
IC packet analysis, so we all know

2599
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:49,320
IC package is because in terms of transfer or transfer

2600
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,320
may have gone wrong and produced

2601
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,820
are bad cells, or tumors as they're commonly known.

2602
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:56,900
Is it possible to use electrodes to stimulate and make it

2603
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:59,960
wrong turn into right

2604
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,500
Then proceed to produce normal cells

2605
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,700
can then replace the original abnormal cells

2606
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:10,400
this...

2607
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:13,100
No, I think the idea is very creative

2608
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:14,260
but i really...

2609
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:17,100
Sorry, I can't answer because I'm not a doctor

2610
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,100
Perhaps some doctors have done such an experiment

2611
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,700
He will tell you if this is possible

2612
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:24,700
Because sometimes I won't tell you right away that it's not possible

2613
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:27,700
because actually many things

2614
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:31,700
because sometimes there are things that just don't have the right material to do it

2615
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:35,700
The problem we often find when we make materials is

2616
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:41,700
Some people have some wrong ideas before because there was no proper material before

2617
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:44,700
Now that there are appropriate materials, is it possible to do such a thing?

2618
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:47,700
Maybe you can try again

2619
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:50,700
But so far we haven't been doing this.

2620
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,700
We've never heard a doctor tell us that there's such a possibility.

2621
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:56,700
But I guess it's an idea

2622
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:58,700
You can try to find literature

2623
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:00,700
see if anyone does

2624
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,500
If you find warmth and are interested

2625
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:08,000
Our middle school has its own program, including a PhD program

2626
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
There are all kinds of programs, we welcome you to come

2627
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
thank you doctor

2628
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Do you have other people's questions?

2629
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I want to ask you a question

2630
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I see you've done a great job on the side of NPT

2631
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Then you also answered some key questions about creating potential changes

2632
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:41,000
But I think whether it's in our biological or medical part

2633
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,000
In fact, everyone is more familiar

2634
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I think it is useful for living things

2635
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
is the increase or decrease in the expression of its protein

2636
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I think that's probably why when you submit

2637
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
will be subject to some responses

2638
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So my question is

2639
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Parts for these BioSensor

2640
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,000
How to use electrical signal to detect in...

2641
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
any target, such as a limited change in a protein in a nerve cell

2642
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Is there such a way?

2643
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
i think this question

2644
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
In fact, my questions today are very good, I like it very much

2645
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Actually what you mentioned is that I just mentioned

2646
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I just gave you a simple hint

2647
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
That is to say, the guide polymer

2648
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
The guide polymer itself has a very good function, which is

2649
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Excuse me

2650
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
OK

2651
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
One of the biggest functions of guiding polymers is to use them as biological detectors

2652
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Why can he be a biodetector? Because it's simple

2653
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
You just saw that we can do molecular modification, right?

2654
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I'm sorry, let me run another one to try love

2655
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
you can do molecular modification

2656
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
After molecular modification

2657
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,580
I can easily pick some on it

2658
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:08,740
Next up is Leaghan

2659
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:11,240
Get something to detect

2660
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,980
Then the conduction below you is an electrical signal

2661
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:15,740
with a Leaghan on it

2662
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:19,040
So when any organism comes

2663
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,640
When creating a Binding with this Leaghan

2664
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,240
It may affect the transmission of electrical signals below

2665
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:28,500
you create a difference in electrical signal

2666
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:31,500
This electrical signal can then be used as a biometric sensor

2667
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:33,840
So we're doing something like this

2668
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,540
just because of today's time

2669
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:39,340
I probably can't tell you all the results of 10 years

2670
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,040
I only gave two examples

2671
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,040
But you said biometric sensors are really important

2672
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:45,340
And that's actually in the conductive polymer

2673
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:49,240
It's what everyone was doing in the first place.

2674
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:52,540
In the early days, everyone came to make biological detectors.

2675
01:46:52,540 --> 01:46:54,940
Because biometric sensors are very important

2676
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:58,140
We're relatively not doing biometric detection ourselves right now.

2677
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:00,180
But many of the things we're doing

2678
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:10,000
We are catching, in addition to organic electro-shock materials, we also have a large branch to capture the so-called circulating cancer cells

2679
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:18,000
But we start with another big piece, about 40% to 50% of the research is in that direction

2680
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:27,000
So these two pieces are actually very big. I just mentioned a little bit about our first three pieces: Bioimaging, Biodetection, and Bioelectronic

2681
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:35,000
This part is about biological detection, including how we understand the mutation of cancer cells. We are doing this part.

2682
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
if

2683
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:47,000
We are at the action, we can see that you can do accenture, actuator, how is the actuator doing now?

2684
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:58,000
The actuator is actually no, not now, and it is not doing it now, because the actuator is not doing it because of the lack of human resources.

2685
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
actuator is

2686
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,600
It's not us, in fact, we are the other way around.

2687
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,400
I think we are doing the more difficult

2688
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,440
because we feel that saying

2689
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,400
Since there are such resources

2690
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,800
It seems like we should be doing some comparisons

2691
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,100
to challenge something more difficult

2692
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:16,900
I don't think we're doing simple

2693
01:48:16,900 --> 01:48:17,920
Instead feel

2694
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:21,500
Sometimes our lab sometimes complains to me that we are doing difficult things

2695
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,660
last question

2696
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:30,700
Hello, I am

2697
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,000
this speech is very good

2698
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,260
Just now I

2699
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:35,060
The informant mentioned that

2700
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:36,080
Part of X-rayter

2701
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,360
I'm curious to say

2702
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:38,400
when this vibration

2703
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,660
it is this

2704
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:43,260
Its tension is similar to this part of their way to achieve the limit of human beings

2705
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,820
The way they say if it's doing the same as the limit

2706
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:46,840
they are likely to do

2707
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:47,860
Increase

2708
01:48:47,860 --> 01:48:50,680
That is to say, in the experiment, let some people

2709
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:51,460
Insufficient grip strength

2710
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:52,460
or his

2711
01:48:52,460 --> 01:48:54,780
If they can't stand up, they can do it

2712
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:56,560
Enhance the human body ability to this part

2713
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,820
It's just like being curious that he can follow

2714
01:48:58,820 --> 01:48:59,840
Bio-chamber mixed

2715
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Uh uh this is not exclusion

2716
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
OK

2717
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Yes, let's go

2718
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,400
I should prepare a hundred slimes today

2719
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:09,300
Because I have Sly

2720
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:12,000
But I'm now Sly in the computer

2721
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,000
It might take a lot of time if I'm driving

2722
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I'll simply answer your question

2723
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
so we say

2724
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
it actually

2725
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:22,000
This x-ray is right

2726
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
The so-called x-ray thing, I actually did some when I was in my doctoral class

2727
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Then some of my former collaborators and I

2728
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
included in australia

2729
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
This piece of x-ray is doing very well in Australia

2730
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
that's not you

2731
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
It's what we live for.

2732
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
or how to actually x-ray

2733
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,000
The performance of conduction to molecules is very good

2734
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
very good

2735
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
just say

2736
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Just like what my classmate mentioned just now is

2737
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Where is your market and how do you find mass production

2738
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
That is the problem of commercial ratio

2739
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,000
that's a problem

2740
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
But on Santipi I think they did a very, very good job

2741
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
They learn some, of course they learn some very strange surrounds like what

2742
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
They say, you want to see what's the use of putting it like this

2743
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
They can make a fish, so that the fish can move by itself

2744
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Or, in fact, when I was in BHD, I also received

2745
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
We actually have pick up some of this like

2746
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Robot's Project

2747
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
In fact, for robots, Actualator is very useful for robots

2748
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Because if you think about it, robots now use mechanical methods to do things

2749
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
The mechanical way is from metal material, so the weight is very heavy

2750
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
What they want is that if I change the mechanical way into the material way

2751
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:42,000
In the way of Actualator, it's like you put ligaments on your robotic arm

2752
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
He hopes that the Actualator is like a ligament, a soft substance

2753
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
It means that his idea comes from saying that the arm of a robot must have soft matter

2754
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Instead of using mechanical means to move the joints

2755
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Instead, the articulation is done in a material way

2756
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
They hope to achieve lightweight

2757
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Of course, this stock has been doing it back then

2758
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,480
But because I really didn't do it now

2759
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,680
So I'm not quite sure where the newest has made it now

2760
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,820
Early in about my time

2761
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,520
In the early 2000s

2762
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:13,120
I think it is a very popular feel

2763
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:19,960
at the end make a

2764
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:21,160
There is one here

2765
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:22,920
It's a question I really want to ask, isn't it?

2766
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:28,920
right

2767
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,920
microphone

2768
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,920
Excuse me

2769
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,420
hello i am a general public

2770
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:42,920
I would like to ask some doctors for their views on the so-called 2045 plan

2771
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:44,920
news on the internet

2772
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:47,920
I don't know if it's true or it will come true

2773
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:50,920
It's like the idea in the Avatar movie.

2774
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:53,920
First from the human will to control the machine and then

2775
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:56,920
Make life more possible

2776
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
it's ok i want this stuff

2777
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
i never

2778
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
do not do any negation

2779
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Neither do I, but I can't make any affirmations with you

2780
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Sorry, this is so far

2781
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
We focus on the academics of Science

2782
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Um

2783
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
don't be like i said

2784
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Well, the Science I told you at the beginning is

2785
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Hollywood is great

2786
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
they can

2787
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
tell us many ways

2788
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
but our own words

2789
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
we will feel academic

2790
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
come to see for ourselves

2791
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
We used to think Alphabuy was impossible

2792
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
but now you can

2793
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I never said no

2794
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
but I cannot say yes right now

2795
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Someone thought about it before

2796
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
It's just that computers aren't fast enough

2797
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
The computer is not fast enough now

2798
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
The computer is fast enough now

2799
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
that is

2800
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
just right

2801
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
so i think

2802
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Such a wonderful speech today

2803
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I make a quick summary

2804
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Because Academia Sinica

2805
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
What we do is basic research

2806
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
just like this time

2807
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Boss mentioned this to us

2808
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Conductive

2809
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,340
After the new material of organic polymer comes out

2810
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:09,040
Then we can find that it can be compared with biological cells

2811
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:12,240
Many things in living organisms can be done very effectively

2812
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:14,880
then unbroken binding

2813
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,000
So we can use the outside world to conduct electricity

2814
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,600
with current

2815
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:23,640
Then go talk to creatures and change some creatures inside

2816
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:26,480
or one of some of its functions

2817
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:30,080
Go can do some conversion or do some sides

2818
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:35,180
After all, there are still many, many, many possibilities for the application behind this.

2819
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:38,220
So its whole breaking point is in that one

2820
01:53:38,220 --> 01:53:40,180
conductive polymer

2821
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:41,320
that

2822
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:44,420
It is the whole discovery of conducting polymer

2823
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:45,680
This is a

2824
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:47,780
a jumping one

2825
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:49,880
A Progressive Advancement in Academics

2826
01:53:49,880 --> 01:53:51,780
So under this basic research

2827
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:54,180
For this thing in the future

2828
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:55,780
where will it go

2829
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:58,680
We all don't know the truth now

2830
01:53:58,680 --> 01:53:59,880
so today again

2831
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,640
That Dr. You gave us some direction

2832
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:05,840
Those directions are the ones that are going on now.

2833
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,280
So just had some very practical questions

2834
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,200
Is it possible to do this

2835
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,680
Can you do that back to the end?

2836
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:14,240
What are the details of the impact it will have afterwards?

2837
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:18,320
I think this is what we have to do in scientific research now

2838
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:19,520
because everyone knows

2839
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:22,120
We now your laser is better than this thing

2840
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:23,160
lasers are everywhere

2841
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:24,960
When the laser came out

2842
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:29,320
It's just that there are two conversions that can be connected inside.

2843
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:31,440
So when I found that

2844
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:36,280
It never occurred to me that lasers can now be used as scalpels

2845
01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:39,280
can do your music can save

2846
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:40,880
it's all behind

2847
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,560
So what we are doing in the hospital of traditional Chinese medicine is a kind of

2848
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,920
Very upstream basic research

2849
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,360
We hope to be able to find some direction

2850
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:50,040
Pad some ground

2851
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:54,200
Find the one that can confirm which of these works

2852
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,080
what other possible directions

2853
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,640
Then there are many, many steps below

2854
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,080
this thing

2855
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:01,400
Is it possible to mass produce

2856
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:03,840
Is it possible to go down

2857
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,200
Of course, the people behind will come to relay.

2858
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:09,840
So we are doing a lot of trying

2859
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,280
something will fail

2860
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:12,960
something will work out

2861
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,600
I don't know this

2862
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:17,720
So now it's the work of doing these explorations

2863
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:20,120
Hope some people do upstream

2864
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,760
Some do midstream

2865
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:22,880
Some say downstream

2866
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,840
string this thing up

2867
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:25,840
so today

2868
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,960
So some things may be more abstract

2869
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,120
It's because of what we're doing now

2870
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:31,680
yeah just look

2871
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,200
Are these things really useful?

2872
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:37,160
always try something first

2873
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:39,080
that tells the report

2874
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:41,080
Today's report is to tell you some

2875
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:42,880
progress in this area

2876
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,760
that is maybe in a few years

2877
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:46,480
we can stop

2878
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,280
It's not about coming back and looking again

2879
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:50,200
is there something in five years

2880
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,760
some new developments

2881
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,160
or you can download from

2882
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,440
some media reports

2883
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:56,240
if there are some new developments

2884
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:57,600
will also know

2885
01:55:57,640 --> 01:55:59,680
So today our knowledge

2886
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:00,080
want to

2887
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,040
This purpose is to tell you about some of the latest developments

2888
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:09,840
So that's the purpose of all today

2889
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:14,040
So before I wrap up I want to report back

2890
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:17,240
Preview next month in May

2891
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:20,000
Knowledge Trial on May 23rd

2892
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
We have another theme that is

2893
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Genome Center

2894
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Hong Shangcheng of Genome Research Center

2895
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Specific Researcher and Director

2896
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Tell us about molecular blood

2897
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:39,000
That fold is not a fold but a fold

2898
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
So it's another field

2899
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
have another development

2900
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
is actually a molecule

2901
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
but it's totally different

2902
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
From another point of view

2903
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I think today's time is also very tight

2904
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Then let's thank you at this time

2905
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Brilliant copy given to us by Dr. Xia Hua

2906
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:05,740
thank you for the glory

2907
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:07,560
Thanks

2908
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,200
