1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,260
Leader Nui?

2
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,420
Yen Jiang will

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,180
with this

4
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,220
speech

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,720
is

6
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,220
please, China

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's fourteen

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
once a month for the first time in 2014

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But it's the last time in twelve years

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because next year will be a new year

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Say hello to everyone

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am very pleased to invite Dr. Chen Jindi from the Institute of Chemistry today

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To introduce this colorful world

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
from the traditional rash

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Optoelectronic technology from craftsmanship to fashion

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then Dr. Chen is now in the Institute of Chemistry

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The main areas of the researcher are

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Organic Optoelectronic Materials

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Including Organic Light Emitting Diodes

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
and research and development of organic solar cell materials

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Tamkang University

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,920
In 1982, he joined the Department of Chemistry, National Taiwan University.

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,880
I got a master's degree in my laboratory

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,120
Then he got military service

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,480
Then went to America in 1987

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,840
the University of Illinois

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,440
Received Ph.D. in 1992

28
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,640
Then at Caltech

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,160
Three years as a postdoctoral fellow

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,360
Joined the Institute of Chemistry in 1995

31
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,760
Then when everyone is a postdoctoral fellow

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,800
Ph.D. and postdoctoral

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,280
non-linear optical materials

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,400
This thing is following the light

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,960
Visible light is strongly absorbed

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,960
After returning to Taiwan in 1995

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,500
The initial research topic was organic light-emitting diodes

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,520
Organic light-emitting diodes are now many

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,520
These very colorful materials inside a flat-panel display

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,520
The electrons emit light and then emit various kinds of light

41
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,120
Then in the last five or six years, we have been researching solar cell materials

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,820
Then you know if you want to absorb solar energy

43
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,520
That is, all kinds of attractive materials

44
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,120
Can absorb sunlight very effectively

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,920
So there are some materials related to the color

46
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
is its specialty

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:51,320
So the topic of its speech today is this colorful world

48
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,320
That Dr. Chen can in 2002

49
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Awarded the third Tsinghua Chemical Science, Technology, Culture and Education Foundation

50
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
outstanding period

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,800
In 2003, he won the Research Works Award for Young Scholars from Academia Sinica

52
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:14,400
In 2004, won the case award of patent and transfer of Academia Sinica in that year

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Therefore, there are more than 100 papers, more than ten patents, and three special books

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,600
It is for him to serve as the deputy director of the Institute of Chemistry from 2005 to 2009

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,800
So this subject and even his research specialty

56
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,400
So we welcome Dr. Chen to talk about designing the world with warm applause

57
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Thank you, Peng Fude, for introducing

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,600
In fact he was my teacher

59
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
He should be called Mr. Peng respectfully.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,400
Now because everyone is working since graduation

61
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,400
So now it is considered to be serving in the same unit

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,820
have this chance

63
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,000
This was also successfully invited by Mr. Peng.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,200
Come and make one for everyone before Chinese New Year

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,160
Such a report of a feast of knowledge

66
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,200
because of the new year

67
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,500
so i think

68
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,720
The topic I think is also very suitable for this season

69
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,920
Here are some colorful ones for you

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
beautiful pattern

71
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,860
After seeing it like this

72
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,920
Everyone can go back to celebrate the New Year happily

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,240
This is a question of comparing penises

74
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,140
Okay, this topic is

75
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,740
Mainly talking about dyes

76
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,740
Dyes I think everyone knows very well

77
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,640
Everyone knows that since childhood

78
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,540
This is the part about color

79
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,220
In fact, this color

80
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,340
I want to talk about the origin of some history

81
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,940
This is what you see

82
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,940
inside the disaster of the speech

83
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
mentioned this

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,860
I'll tell you a little bit about the discovery of this color in a moment.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,700
The origin of history

86
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,100
sorry

87
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,500
This laser ratio is somewhat

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,900
good this

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,000
talk about color

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,300
In fact, I want to explain a little bit about the origin of this color

91
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,600
The reason why there are colors on the earth

92
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Generates a relationship between the sun and the sun

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,600
The basis for this is very simple

94
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,400
In fact this happens this color

95
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
One of them is a very famous person

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,200
It's Newton

97
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
what about this experiment

98
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,200
The experiment in a forest environment called Newton

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
because you all know

100
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,000
If you put the sunlight in this mountain forest

101
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,800
shine on the forest

102
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,600
It can decompose the sunlight into various colors

103
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,500
Let's talk about this colorful neon color

104
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,400
red orange yellow green blue green purple

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,800
So in fact sunlight is

106
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Sources of colors that our human eyes see all over the planet

107
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
from the sun

108
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
what color

109
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Add all colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, green and purple together

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
becomes white

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
so we see sunlight

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,200
Predominantly white light color

113
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,300
Of course this algae turns yellow

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
will be a bit off

115
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,800
Algae turned yellow will be closer to yellow-orange color

116
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,700
Among Japanese people, the light color is closer to pure white

117
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,800
This is because the atmosphere is dry and old sunlight

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,800
According to the color of the earth, there are some distorted colors

119
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
produced by the phenomenon of color twisting

120
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Humans have five senses

121
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
Inside the facial features of a person

122
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,100
In fact, only the eyes are responsible for seeing

123
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,600
Seeing things is that our human eyes are able to distinguish

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,000
Different colors of light come out

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because of the structural relationship between our eyes and people

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,800
This is the reason for the origin of a simple color

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,600
This visible light sun actually emits a lot

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,200
The radiant energy of different bands comes out

129
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
Visible light from the sun can only

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,800
It's just the visible light in a short area

131
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,800
What about all the sources of radiation?

132
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,300
is very widely distributed

133
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
from what everyone knows

134
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,000
The ones on the radio are called radio waves

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,500
That is a type of energy emitted by sunlight

136
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Or let's talk about a kind of light wave

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Visible light is only in this wide band

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
within a narrow range

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
What is the shortest possible X-ray and cosmic color line?

140
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,500
It is one of the rays emitted by the sun

141
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
The fact that our human eyes see the color of objects

142
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,000
This is about color

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,500
mainly due to two or three factors

144
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
We'll actually get to that shortly later

145
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,000
This basic color is caused by two reasons

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
one is additive color

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
a color called vanishing

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,500
let's look at this first

149
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,000
This is not an analysis from another angle

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
what color is this

151
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,500
our human eyes

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,500
see what color is made of

153
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Burning hot paper of full red lip aperture like sun light

154
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,900
If your stuff is transparent

155
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,200
All light will pass through

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,700
None of the beams will be blocked

157
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,200
In this example it means

158
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,800
It shoots light except red and orange

159
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,000
let it penetrate outside

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,300
Everything else will be absorbed

161
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,000
Then what we see with our eyes is

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,500
light passing through

163
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,600
In the example drawn above the figure

164
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,100
This is what our eyes see

165
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,500
it's red orange

166
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,000
In the middle example

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,800
It allows the blue and sky blue to pass through

168
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
At this time, the object we saw

169
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,200
it's sky blue

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,300
by analogy

171
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,400
This thing looks yellow-green

172
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,500
Because this yellow-green light can pass through

173
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,600
So what our eyes see

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,900
In fact one of the sun's rays

175
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,400
We call it Complementary Color

176
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,500
In addition to penetrating

177
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,300
cause this phenomenon to occur

178
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,900
another one is

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,400
The principle of reflection is the same, resulting in the same effect

180
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,200
If you don't have a thing that will be absorbed by your object

181
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
then you see all the rays

182
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,100
See all the principles of red and yellow

183
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,600
then what you see is white light

184
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,400
same

185
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,900
If all your other lights except red and orange

186
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
no absorption

187
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,100
The red and orange will be reflected by it

188
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,200
At this time, what you see will also be red.

189
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,800
This is explained by the phenomenon of reflection

190
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,000
The color the object renders

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,100
It is to make it adhere to the same principle as when penetrating

192
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,600
something not absorbed by that thing

193
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,900
and be seen by our eyes

194
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,000
That's where the colors we see come from

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,100
this is from

196
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,600
So what our eyes see is the color of the object

197
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
In fact, it is the protection shot of the light shot

198
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,600
Our Chen's tail is called Hubushe

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,400
is caused by this reason

200
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,300
This shield shot causes the color of many objects

201
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,900
A very important reason for the color of objects

202
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,100
what we see most

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Ink sprayed over a watch

204
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,360
you go buy this ink cartridge

205
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,020
There will be these three dots on it

206
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
this color ink cartridge

207
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,200
It's going to have this cyan, magenta, and yellow dotted on it.

208
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,400
What about these three colors?

209
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,600
It's actually on this color chart

210
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,160
It's actually the three colors on this side

211
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,800
The three colors of Y, M, and C

212
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,840
What about these three colors?

213
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,480
In fact like yellow

214
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,960
Actually the complementary color of blue

215
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,360
What about the cyan color?

216
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
it is the complementary color of red

217
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Then the color of sheep's head red is the complementary color of green

218
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,160
The red, blue, green

219
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,760
we call it tricolor

220
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,560
What about the three colors?

221
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,760
after being absorbed

222
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,560
you'll see its complementary color

223
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,960
It is the three colors of Y, M and C we just talked about

224
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,760
In fact we can see that

225
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,360
so-called complementary colors

226
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,360
caused this removal

227
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,360
that paint

228
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Will melt, color, this paint and so on

229
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
all are

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wujie you because I just saw it before

231
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,520
it is not absorbed by it

232
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,860
The color after being worn by us

233
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,020
and it reflects

234
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,520
colors not absorbed by it

235
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,560
The origin of the complementary colors we see

236
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,860
In fact, on light compensation

237
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,400
You can do progressive analysis like

238
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,900
If you absorb the color of this area

239
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,300
Just now this area was red and orange

240
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,060
a little yellow in color

241
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,660
If the color in this area is absorbed

242
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,720
all your eyes can see

243
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,360
Green Natural Blue

244
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,320
This is called complementary relationship

245
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,660
So there are three cases

246
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,820
What we say in terms of triadic colors

247
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,820
There are three situations

248
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,160
This is the second case

249
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,360
put the yellow green blue thin tone in the middle

250
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,820
Your eyes can only see red and blue around it

251
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,060
The third is that you put the short wavelength

252
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,120
This fine shade of blue green natural color

253
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,860
Your eyes can only see long wavelengths

254
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,120
yellow and red

255
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,220
This is the reason for the complementary color of the object

256
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,820
That's right, that's how it's explained by industry scholars.

257
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,460
Of course if you absorb all the light colors

258
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,560
what color is that

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,760
It becomes black in the middle

260
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,760
you can't see anything

261
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,660
because all the light is absorbed by the object

262
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,860
so you can't see any color

263
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,860
Can't see any color is black

264
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,960
So black is also a color

265
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,160
The color with nothing is called black

266
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,060
Alright, this next has to do with chemistry comparisons

267
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,660
This is because I am doing chemistry

268
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,760
We say that these colors come from sunlight

269
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,960
But in fact matter

270
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Our place to see is matter

271
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,460
The substance itself will produce some color

272
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,960
These colors arise entirely from the

273
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,960
caused by the basic chemical elements of which a substance is composed

274
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,460
then listen to all matter

275
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,960
We roughly divide into two categories

276
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,960
called organic materials or inorganic substances

277
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
How to distinguish between organic and inorganic

278
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,460
this is in chemistry

279
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,160
We usually use this to distinguish

280
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
If you have a lot of

281
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,960
The elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen

282
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
this is called organic matter

283
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
like us

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,500
The amino acids we eat, the vitamin

285
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,100
Or the sugar we eat, these are made into organic matter

286
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,000
And the fat we eat is still there

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Swallow these elemental things of green oxygen egg

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This stuff is called organic matter

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,600
In addition to these few I use black circles

290
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,500
outside of the circled elements

291
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,300
The periodic table has more than 100 images in total

292
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,200
100 now has 10 to 110 more elements

293
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,700
Deduct these elements

294
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,000
substances made of other elements

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Inorganic matter

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,200
This substance is divided into two categories

297
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,600
The color is also composed of these materials

298
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,700
organic and inorganic

299
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,700
But the reasons for the colors they produce are different

300
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,200
This is a substance made up of inorganic elements

301
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,800
the colors it makes

302
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,300
actually depends on the size of your composing elements

303
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,000
Like this Buddha these are

304
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,400
Lu Shu's substance

305
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,100
Buddha is gas

306
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,440
it itself is yellow

307
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,300
slightly yellow

308
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,540
slightly bigger green

309
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,800
that is green

310
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,300
show is liquid

311
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,200
but it's orange

312
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,900
then click

313
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,700
turns purple

314
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,400
it's bigger

315
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,900
The color will vary with the size of this atom

316
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,500
different means i change

317
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,400
Another class is made of these metals

318
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,000
made up of ions or elements

319
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,500
Different ions have different colors

320
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,600
For example, like this tire

321
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
In fact, white has no color

322
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
what about this one

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,900
or fall?

324
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,200
is yellow

325
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,700
Its color has something to do with its structure

326
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,800
For example, these two are called Falling Frost and Ion

327
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,600
It's just that this is a two sticks connected together

328
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
But this structure is different

329
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,000
Its constituent metal elements are the same

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,500
But the structurally different relationship

331
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,600
cause different colors

332
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
These are a characteristic of inorganic materials

333
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,000
its color big

334
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,200
What's the depth

335
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,500
or different colors

336
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
depends on the size of the atom

337
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,500
or its structure

338
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,780
to make an impact

339
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,280
This is an inorganic material

340
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,040
Organic materials as I just said

341
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,740
The whole medium is composed of elements in carbon, oxygen and nitrogen

342
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,240
its color composition

343
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,840
In fact, with these carbon-carbon doubles

344
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,380
If there is no carbon-carbon double piece

345
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,840
all organic matter

346
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,140
usually no color

347
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,340
is transparent

348
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,840
The shade of this color is

349
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,380
Red, blue, green?

350
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,540
Depends on the amount of this carbon-carbon double

351
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,840
Let's talk about this carbon-carbon double piece

352
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,080
it has beat electrons

353
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
beat more electrons

354
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,880
your color will be darker

355
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,080
The color will be longer wavelength

356
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,380
It is the direction of the red offset

357
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,580
it may have been blue at first

358
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,980
later turned green

359
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,780
may be yellow

360
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,380
Then there is orange red

361
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,080
The longer the wavelength of the color

362
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,980
So I beat the number of electrons more and more

363
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
while there is a proportional increase

364
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,680
as organic and inorganic compounds

365
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,080
The color produced is actually not the same principle

366
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,780
But the result is the same

367
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,680
Causes the appearance of colors in visible light

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Our eyes can perceive this visible light

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So people are the reason why they can see colors

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Although different substances

371
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,500
the principle is the same

372
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
Let me give you an example soon

373
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,700
Like the ones pictured here

374
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,000
all organic matter

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,400
And these substances actually have different colors

376
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,500
for example this

377
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
This looks like the shortest molecule

378
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,800
its absorbing wavelength

379
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,300
It's actually the shortest of the four.

380
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,100
its absorption wavelength

381
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
The location is probably in this place

382
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,600
It absorbs blue light

383
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,400
So our eyes see this

384
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,300
Substances that absorb blue light

385
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,400
In fact, it will appear more or less yellowish

386
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,600
color appears

387
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
This one is slightly longer

388
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,700
Take more electrons

389
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Its absorption wavelength will be slightly longer

390
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500
It absorbs mainly green light

391
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,000
Complementary colors that our eyes see

392
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,800
is to show a color like this carambola

393
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,100
monodentate pile

394
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
If it continues to grow

395
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,100
Its absorption wavelength becomes more and more to the right

396
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Go ahead, this side absorbs the yellow-orange color

397
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,300
The color it presents at this time

398
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,300
It will be the color of the complementary color below, Iron Blue

399
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
And finally if it hides to a certain extent

400
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,500
it absorbs red light

401
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,500
At this time, the substance will show a green luster.

402
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,500
This is exactly a rendering of a complementary color

403
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,700
Okay, this is about the color

404
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm starting to tell the history of this color discovery

405
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,300
In this so-called chemical technology

406
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,500
or before technology

407
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,000
Human beings can get colors from nature

408
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
I saw this here and found a few photos for everyone to see.

409
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,200
The most primitive and primitive bibliophile

410
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,700
It's always written in the book

411
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,000
The source of the most original color is taken from nature

412
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,600
For example, this ingredient

413
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,300
This is called sporite

414
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,000
It's the color that produces that orange-red color

415
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,400
There is another one called Zheshi

416
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
this translated word

417
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This color is a stone showing this dark purple color

418
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
so you can see this stone age

419
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The colors painted on the walls of this cave

420
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
last saved until now

421
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why do you still see the pattern caused by these two colors?

422
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Because at that time it was possible to obtain colors from nature

423
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Probably the most common are these two colors

424
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
so you look at this mural

425
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Most of them are renderings of these two colors

426
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Then this is all things from the stone age

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
After the emergence of human culture

428
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
marl culture like ingal

429
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Or China's ice cat swimming that painted

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The color painted on the artist's face

431
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
with egypt

432
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Egypt is one of these major civilizations

433
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You can see the color it takes inside

434
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Most of them are biased towards this orange

435
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
or this pleated red color

436
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
because at that time

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,100
The source of the most accessible colors

438
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,300
is the material from these colors

439
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,200
while the color material itself provides the most

440
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
these two colors

441
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,600
you go to the book

442
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
the book will tell you

443
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,200
this ever

444
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,200
the first human way

445
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,100
synthetic artificial coloring

446
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,400
It's in this pharaoh's tomb

447
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,200
see this blue substance

448
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Because this blue substance does not exist in nature

449
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,400
It is artificially synthesized

450
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:37,200
Only then can this blue pigment appear

451
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,000
Here we use the current chemical technology

452
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
The ancient Egyptian

453
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,300
How did they go about creating this color?

454
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,000
or did he mix it up with three things

455
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,200
processed by Galle

456
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,800
will be able to generate this thing

457
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,600
This thing is called Acidic Copper Tears

458
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Although it is something like a stone

459
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
But this stone is colored

460
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The color is the natural color

461
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
what are these three things it uses

462
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The main source of color is from this

463
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Copper Carbonate

464
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This thing is called malachite

465
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
this is in

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
presumably earlier

467
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Egypt has a lot of this malachite

468
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So they can get local material

469
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Use this as the source of the color

470
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The colors they make are natural colors

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Then the quartz sand mixed in

472
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Quartz sand is the Sally by the sea

473
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
main source

474
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that egypt in

475
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Where

476
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
In North Africa there is a large

477
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
salad desert

478
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There are many quartz stones in the salad desert

479
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So this material is not a problem

480
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Then there's the marble

481
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
is the source of carbonated limestone

482
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
There are many such things in the world of Egypt

483
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
mixing these three things together

484
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Originally malachite was this greenish thing

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
After the result is processed like this

486
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
it becomes natural color

487
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is the record you can find

488
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's the first artificial

489
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
artificially synthesized

490
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,100
but it is derived from the infinite substance

491
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,000
There are no such things as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in it.

492
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So it's the rate of fire of the infinite dye

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Well, those colors, of course this was discovered a long time ago

494
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Then it was later used in the creation of this art

495
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I found a few pictures that can be found on the Internet

496
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
For example, the last supper of Jesus

497
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I’ve been to this place before, which city in Italy doesn’t matter

498
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Teacher Peng took us there

499
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This one is actually a colored lake

500
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
"Monalis" is smiling, look at the fact

501
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The color has faded over time.

502
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It fades into the color of that yellow coffee color

503
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
In fact, it turned out to be a colored substance

504
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
These are famous paintings

505
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
colorful colors on top

506
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Including the more modern ones like this Monet

507
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But it is also a painting more than a hundred years ago

508
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This is also his painting, this one is called

509
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
"In Spring Mountain" I can't find out what is the name of this

510
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
used in these things

511
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,960
These pigment dyes

512
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,460
But because of the relationship at that time

513
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,760
Because this is an earlier relationship

514
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,860
Relationships over a hundred years ago

515
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,460
At that time there was no synthesis technology

516
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,760
In fact, they are all raw materials

517
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,660
e.g. white pigment

518
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,460
At that time, it was made of carbon fiber, sulfate fiber

519
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,660
made of oxidized fiber

520
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,860
The yellow one is made of this acid fiber

521
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,260
The blue one is made of this

522
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,500
This iron complex is composed of

523
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
Composed of elements such as red blood fiber and yellow blood fiber

524
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,560
Green is ash

525
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,400
Composition of yellow blood fiber, red blood fiber and acid copper

526
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
This is all information you can find on the Internet.

527
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,800
The red color is composed of the fibrous compounds of wood acid and

528
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,800
And these oxide fibers and copper oxide

529
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,500
These are the early paintings

530
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,200
Just use these non-productive pigment dyes

531
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,160
to do drawing work

532
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,120
The fact that these product-free materials are also used in

533
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,440
The things used in this printing into the newspaper

534
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
This is holding up to now to compare

535
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,400
Civilization above the printed work we do

536
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,440
Most of the oil used for release

537
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,800
All come from the materials composed of these inorganic substances

538
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,440
it will come in a variety of different colors

539
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,600
The setting of the inorganic pigment like this

540
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,000
It is also used in this yellow line of the gang line

541
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,600
The reason why I mention this is

542
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
It turns out that the yellow line is mainly made of these

543
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,200
made of inorganic compounds

544
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,440
like this vulcanized septum or

545
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,840
Acid drop this kind of thing

546
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,000
This thing we just saw earlier

547
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,640
But it's really on the pavement now

548
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,000
There's a lot of these yellow paints too

549
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,240
made of organic matter

550
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,440
There is an English text here

551
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,540
I took it from this website

552
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,840
This site says

553
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,040
Wall-making-Pent Composition

554
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,040
The road style of these yellow board horse lines

555
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
the end of its oil

556
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,720
what is the composition of the paint

557
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
This is explaining the composition of these paints

558
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,160
Usually made of this fluidized terrier or Lutheran

559
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,160
But now there are a lot of yellow poultices like this

560
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,600
is made of this thing

561
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,880
This thing is called Benzidine Yellow

562
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,920
Translated into this text is called Lianben Anhuang

563
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,880
This is made of an organic substance

564
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
substance with a yellow color

565
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,160
what about this thing

566
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,320
Because there are some chemicals

567
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,440
The release of this same thing is also used in many current cars.

568
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,720
paint on car body

569
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,320
For example, the yellow color of the little yellow we are talking about

570
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,120
It's actually made of this yellow paint substance

571
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,520
And the substance of this paint is actually

572
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Made entirely of organic matter

573
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,960
you will see it has many

574
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,640
Pai Tan Tan double key Pai electronic

575
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,920
There are a lot of rings on this one

576
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,440
So many rings connected together

577
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,240
it will appear in color

578
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,840
depends on your chemical structure

579
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,240
This is all organic matter

580
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,600
like this one is showing this fuchsia

581
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
This one is showing this bright red color

582
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,600
This should be an Alfa Romeo sports car

583
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,000
This red grilled chicken above

584
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,800
Only use organic substances

585
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,600
its color rendering

586
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,400
And what about this dark blue substance?

587
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,200
by this car

588
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,600
is made of this dye

589
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,000
Finally there is a bright green

590
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
this is very colorful

591
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
like the color of this ninja turtle

592
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,000
This is made up of the molecules of this macrocycle

593
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,400
These are the organic substances that came out later

594
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,200
Usually the color of organic matter

595
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,400
Will be brighter and brighter than the color of inorganic substances

596
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,600
because its color is the intensity of the sunlight it absorbs

597
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,400
is relatively strong

598
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,600
So what about Rong Gong's bone-protecting color?

599
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,000
will be stronger

600
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
This is how it looks compared to the inorganic material

601
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So what about organic matter?

602
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,200
One advantage of having this is

603
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
Because it is more colorful

604
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So everyone prefers to color like this

605
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
showy things add to us

606
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,500
in our daily use

607
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,100
Because the colors that appear in this way

608
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,400
will be brighter and brighter

609
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Our race likes to look at that beautiful thing

610
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
strong color

611
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,900
It means very beautiful

612
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,500
Including this of our female compatriots

613
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,300
Facial makeup also includes the use of various paints

614
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,900
Because there are all kinds of colors

615
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,500
In the early days, put these paints like this

616
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,900
Like painting, it contains these heavy metals

617
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,700
Everyone knows that metals are not very healthy for the human body.

618
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,800
So now these cosmetics

619
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,600
It has largely discarded these heavy metal-containing paints

620
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:46,000
Instead, organic substances are used as the color ingredients in cosmetics.

621
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,100
Well, this is me talking about modern times in one breath, right?

622
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,200
But you have to think about it

623
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,000
These things are all because of chemical synthesis

624
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,100
These various organic substances are produced

625
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Organic matter is in fact basically

626
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,040
The colors of these organic substances seen now

627
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,540
Of course it was synthesized in the laboratory.

628
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,040
or synthesized by the industry

629
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Early organic matter was also

630
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,540
But we can see it but we can't use it

631
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,340
Because these early organic substances were roughly drawn from

632
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,340
For example, flowers show very bright colors

633
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,940
What about the colors in the flowers?

634
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,740
are also composed of these organic substances

635
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,540
But whether these substances are the color of flowers

636
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,380
or the color inside an animal's feathers

637
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,380
you can find a way to extract it

638
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,080
But these substances are not stable enough

639
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,680
Not long after you worked so hard to extract it

640
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,180
their color fades

641
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,180
So early these brightly colored substances

642
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,380
It took a lot of effort to get

643
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,780
I went to find a piece of information here.

644
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,840
It was the early days, which should have been in the Middle Ages.

645
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,080
flowers of the color of that time

646
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,600
It is still difficult to obtain

647
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:07,400
At that time, there was a color called Taizi's dye

648
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,600
This Taizi is translated from the English name

649
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,100
How did this dye get it?

650
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,200
I learn a lot of English writing here

651
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,500
Let me translate for you

652
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,000
It's near the Mediterranean Sea and there's a man called Flying Mudbot

653
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,700
The Mudbots live next to the Mediterranean Sea

654
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,800
There is a type of crustacean in that region of the Mediterranean Sea

655
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
This is what the crustacean inside it looks like

656
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,400
You can find photos on the Internet

657
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,800
There is something in this color

658
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,100
When you extract it, it takes on this purple color

659
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,900
So in the middle ages

660
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,300
to get this color

661
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,700
Because what was the color actually used for later?

662
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,800
That this is the Pope's holy robe

663
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,900
You see this is a very famous portrait of Christianity

664
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,000
the angel inside

665
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,700
this is still

666
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
jesus doesn't know what

667
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,900
The robe it wears is the prince

668
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,100
The color dyed by this dye

669
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,000
But the dye didn’t exist at that time, and the chemical solution didn’t come out yet.

670
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,800
How does this person synthesize these organic dyes?

671
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,100
It's from this crustacean to extract it

672
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,900
Here's a narrative I'm talking about

673
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,400
you want to dye a dress like this

674
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,900
do you know how many shells this crustacean needs

675
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,500
He said he wanted 10,000,000,100,000,12,000 of these crustaceans

676
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,500
To be able to dye this piece of clothing

677
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,400
So you can know how difficult it is to obtain this pigment

678
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,400
So at that time in the Middle Ages

679
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,800
Pigments are very, very difficult to obtain

680
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,000
So if you can have a color like this color

681
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,700
Usually a symbol of some kind of power

682
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,400
Those who are not expensive can afford it

683
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,800
can afford this color

684
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
this is

685
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,760
is a history that you can look up

686
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,460
Before artificially synthesizing these dyes

687
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,200
Acquiring dyes is quite a difficult thing

688
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
We often hear people say

689
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,400
What kind of tree roots are you going to extract from?

690
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,200
This has a ready-made example

691
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,000
This is called fenugreek root

692
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,040
What color is the root of the chickweed

693
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,200
brick red color

694
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,040
Because there is one like this in it

695
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,500
The substance of the organic dye appears

696
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,900
So you use the extraction method

697
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,600
from a tree root like this

698
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Extract the substance of such a color

699
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
so you can know

700
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,200
The color is not fetched from

701
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,900
All cancel a natural world

702
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,400
like canceling a fake shellfish

703
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,600
Otherwise, this is extracted from the root of the tree.

704
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,400
it's a hard job

705
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,000
The current situation like this

706
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Until about 100 years ago

707
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Of course the one 150 years ago

708
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,800
We now call him the emergence of Chemist

709
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
This situation has taken a big turn

710
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We now respectfully call it chemical production

711
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
it's british called william burkey

712
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It existed from 1838 to 1907

713
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Probably around the end of the last century to the beginning of the last century

714
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's in fact the first human to synthesize it in a laboratory way

715
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And inventing and synthesizing a substance with a new color appears

716
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
This new color material is called intrinsically safe paper

717
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The color itself has this tinge of purple

718
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
light purple substance

719
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We call this chemical synthesis

720
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Created the first entirely new organic dye

721
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
This thing does not exist in nature

722
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
something like this structure

723
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
and no such thing appears

724
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So the thing it synthesizes is colored

725
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And it's a roughly non-existent color

726
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So it's a color created by humans

727
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,100
matter of color

728
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,600
This is what I found in a book

729
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:11,400
This is the internal substance that was synthesized in his laboratory at the beginning.

730
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
still preserved

731
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,000
This color is called book

732
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,900
Yasuko Moto

733
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,300
This is what we now call the father of painters

734
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,900
because you went to see his hometown

735
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,800
His hometown has been turned into a museum

736
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,500
there is a sign on it

737
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,100
If you zoom in to see him, look at him

738
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,800
this person is actually

739
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,700
because he discovered the synthesis of this dye

740
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,200
One of the next things he did was

741
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,600
He founded an industry based on scientific registration

742
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,700
The meaning of this English word translated into Chinese

743
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,900
Science-based industry industry

744
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,100
means industry

745
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,300
Industry didn't exist before him

746
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,900
The painting industry we are talking about now

747
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,700
just start with it

748
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,400
what great things does it do

749
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,700
It is the self-preparation of the dye

750
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,600
Produce in large quantities Collect in large quantities

751
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,100
Then take it to the market to sell

752
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,900
what color

753
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,200
Because the package is very similar to the purple we talked about earlier.

754
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,000
So it's purple when we talked about it

755
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,500
This is extracted from the carapace and very hard work

756
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,000
You have to collect tens of thousands of things to be able to dye a little cloth

757
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,800
Now it can be mass-produced at one time by synthetic means

758
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:38,100
So the one with the color is no longer the rich and powerful

759
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,800
It's something exclusive

760
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,300
So here you see this is a book

761
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,200
it says

762
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,000
a man it invented a color

763
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,300
And it's like this, this, this move

764
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,800
changed the whole world

765
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,000
I translated it into Chinese

766
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,400
a man invents a color

767
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,800
The world has changed since then

768
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,500
Thus began the chemical industry

769
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,100
that's because

770
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,760
From the beginning of it we will call it the father of chemical engineering

771
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,360
This is also a dye that it synthesized later.

772
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,760
This dye is Qiansu

773
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,960
is what we just saw earlier

774
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,160
This thing extracted from the root of the tree

775
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,160
identical chemical structure

776
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
This is from the root of the tree

777
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
extracted from natural

778
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,060
This microlink thin product from the laboratory

779
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,960
Prepare it by chemical synthesis

780
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,520
So this is so here you look up the history book

781
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,520
It is written that this substance is

782
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,620
produced by chemical synthesis

783
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,920
The first natural organic dye

784
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,220
This dye is found in nature

785
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,520
But in the past, it was extracted from the roots of trees.

786
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:46,420
But it is synthesized by the laboratory

787
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,620
And another of its inventions is

788
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,220
There is no such thing in nature

789
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
completely pure matter created in the laboratory

790
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,220
Okay, let me tell you this is simple

791
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,220
this is chemistry

792
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,020
How did Winter Night synthesize this dye?

793
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,580
add these three things together

794
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,340
All three are made of organic matter

795
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,540
After putting these three things together

796
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,700
Add running acid water and heavy acid

797
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,140
This acts as an oxidizing agent

798
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,700
You can put these three things in this ring together to fix it together

799
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,940
When Wenyuan International synthesized this thing

800
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,340
In fact it doesn't know

801
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,100
it gets in fact a mixture

802
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,500
It includes ABCD

803
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,700
There are at least two ingredients of all sorts

804
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,300
like this one I drew earlier

805
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,900
At least two ingredients make up its pot of medicine

806
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,900
chemical

807
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,300
this is colored

808
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,700
In fact the dye is not a single substance

809
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,900
In fact this mixture

810
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,900
It does this thing in fact it is not its original purpose

811
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,100
write one here

812
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,400
What was it actually supposed to do?

813
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Back then that sadism was troublesome

814
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,000
At that time there was no medicine to treat

815
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,100
I knew at that time

816
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,520
It is said that treating internal diseases can relieve the symptoms

817
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,240
It is from this natural thing called

818
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,040
The bark or roots of economical numbers

819
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,960
It can be distilled into a thing called the neighbor

820
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,000
It can be used to treat internal diseases

821
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,560
Its original purpose at that time was to find a way

822
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,200
This natural substance was synthesized in the laboratory

823
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,520
You can see back then because chemistry was just out

824
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,560
We're not that familiar with this synthesis yet.

825
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,920
Everyone probably knows about this structure that there is a ring in it.

826
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,960
there are eggs in it

827
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,360
There are some oxygen elements in it

828
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,720
So it starts doing the poor job

829
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,120
At that time, the source it chose was to choose these three things

830
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,720
to group it and put those groups

831
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,280
hope to get this thing

832
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,800
Of course it is impossible

833
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,320
We know chemistry very well now

834
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,800
It's impossible to get this thing like this

835
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,160
So its original purpose was not to be a dye

836
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,760
It's actually purely for medical purposes

837
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,080
synthetic work in education

838
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,580
And the narrow false found that it got a colored substance

839
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,580
You see it in a beaker with a jar of purple ejaculation in it

840
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,280
is a drawing

841
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,000
It means that it was walking around in the laboratory at that time

842
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,240
In the end, I got a medicine that I didn't get, but I got a colored substance

843
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,200
its brain moves fast

844
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,240
It wants to say that this is very similar to Taier Paper

845
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,000
So it can be sold on the market

846
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,280
So it actually retired very early

847
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,840
It retired in its 30s

848
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,000
because it invented the dye in the 20s

849
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
big money ever since

850
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
it just keeps working

851
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,800
it's at home by itself

852
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
It has set up a laboratory at home

853
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,500
I am researching and developing various dyes by myself

854
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,200
Because at that time around 30 years old it had already made enough money

855
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,800
Just retreat into the rivers and lakes and do research at home

856
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,200
this and more

857
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,800
this is chemical

858
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,800
Just now I said that he artificially synthesized the first natural dye

859
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,600
He started with this substance

860
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,400
This substance is extracted from plum oil

861
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,400
After one step, two steps and three steps you will get this

862
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,600
Appearance of chigusa reddish yellow dye

863
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,400
The Chicasana yellow dye was made to the UK

864
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,200
Because that Poke-Voyance Brit

865
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,300
This early British floating oath has this red uniform on it

866
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,300
This is the dye used for dyeing

867
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,700
Well, there is another thing that is related to the material of that Thai son.

868
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,700
A very similar thing is called Indigo dye

869
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,300
Indigo dye we now translate it as called

870
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,300
what is this called

871
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,500
electric blue dye

872
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,700
electric blue dye

873
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Indigo dye

874
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,000
This thing is actually what we use to dye jeans now

875
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,900
What about the blue pigment dye that is used the most?

876
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
this is the thing

877
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,300
This stuff is actually the same dye as Tay's son

878
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,960
The results of non-resembling

879
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,500
The fetus is in these two positions

880
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,960
In two more show elements

881
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,300
You take these two show elements

882
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,000
after removing it

883
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,460
closer to blue

884
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,960
What about the blue pigment?

885
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,460
In fact, as we said earlier

886
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,040
you want to get from that crustacean

887
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,660
Distilling this non-functional and hard work

888
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,360
Otherwise you have to get it from the plant

889
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,500
This plant is called

890
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,660
Inside the plant of Miaolan

891
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
This thing can also be extracted

892
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,160
But this refinement is also very troublesome

893
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,600
to go through this

894
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,760
Heavy extraction and purification steps

895
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,920
to get a little something

896
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,220
So the chemical industry in Germany is very fresh

897
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,420
At that time, Germany's Basford Industries

898
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,520
no it's not basford

899
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,260
this bell

900
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,920
Bell is actually owned by Bayer AG in Germany.

901
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,120
the founder

902
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,760
He is also the winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

903
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,160
He invented this synthetic method

904
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,420
It's like Tyrian paper

905
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,560
color dye

906
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,920
After these two steps, he can get

907
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,800
That was in 1882, over six years old

908
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,100
The era of unknown writers and artists

909
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,600
At that time, Germany's chemical industry also began to regenerate.

910
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,200
This synthesis is inconvenient

911
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
improved later

912
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,100
A synthetic christian improvement made by this guy

913
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,700
from a less expensive precursor

914
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,200
It is easier to get this dye out

915
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,100
This is later all changed to use

916
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,200
Lugong Chemical Synthesis

917
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,900
Because the chemical synthesis of Lun Gong is much better than the extraction from natural substances

918
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,900
Or it's much more convenient to extract from the inside of that crustacean

919
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,900
The price is cheap, it can be much cheaper

920
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,100
Anyone who has entered the era of the chemical industry

921
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:45,100
This dye was invented after such a twists and turns

922
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,900
Then we use the most truthful product now

923
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,100
It's a plastic product

924
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,300
Everyone knows that plastic products are often colorless.

925
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,400
But like the clothes you physically wear

926
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,900
These are all made of the real fiber of the real product

927
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,400
It was all colorless

928
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
why now we can wear

929
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,900
There are so many colors

930
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,100
because of all the plastic inside

931
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,200
The dye of ginseng is in this

932
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,500
plastic we can see this

933
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,600
Whether it is PVC, PS

934
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,000
Di density, drama language, high-density drama language and

935
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,600
The drama interest and that PET

936
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,000
The material of the PET bottle is called PET.

937
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,800
There will be colors in it

938
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
The color without ginseng is like this

939
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,600
is white or transparent

940
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,200
this is its original color

941
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,400
But you see these new doctors in every color

942
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,400
All with added dyes or pigments

943
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,200
Only after going inside will these colors appear

944
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,200
Otherwise our world would be very dull

945
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,600
either white or black

946
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Without the invention of this dye

947
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,800
This is about a thing that was often published in newspapers a while ago

948
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,200
peer ratio

949
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,800
This thing is it's a natural pigment

950
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,760
It's a natural pigment very close to something

951
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,200
The closest natural pigment to it is the leaf green tree

952
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,800
we know the natural world

953
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,600
you look at the leaves of that tree

954
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,000
That is, each color of multicolored ice has its own color.

955
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,160
The green in it is made of this

956
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,360
This is a natural substance

957
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,200
That's where the chemical structure of the chlorophyll tree is located

958
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,400
Look at this sodium copper chlorophyllin

959
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Does it look very similar to this structure?

960
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,600
It removes the long tail

961
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,600
then it puts

962
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,800
I see this upside down

963
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,400
Everything else looks very similar

964
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,800
There is one thing that is different

965
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
It puts the beautiful element of MG in the middle

966
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,000
changed to copper

967
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,800
why is this thing called copper

968
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,200
The reason this word is in it

969
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,400
It is because it puts the beauty in the leafy green tree

970
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,200
The metal was replaced by copper

971
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,800
and then it's next to this

972
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,200
this is a sour root

973
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,600
The acid radical will carry an ion with a that

974
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,000
in this position with

975
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
All three positions will carry acid radicals

976
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,600
and then carry that

977
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
so this position

978
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,180
The name of this painting is called Same Ye Filter Tree Na

979
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,180
I found this from the website

980
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,160
I'll read it for everyone

981
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,600
Although everyone understands what it means

982
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,560
The same leaf filter refers to the leaf filter semi-synthetic

983
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,560
a practical pigment

984
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,560
it's actually edible

985
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,440
it is called natural green tree

986
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,440
number three

987
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,440
It also has an English serial number called 1141

988
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,420
In Taiwan, it is a practical pigment that can be added at zero clock

989
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
But it cannot be added to the practical oil

990
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,580
A while ago, the inner defender in the newspaper made a shameful mistake.

991
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
it adds it to utility oil

992
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,080
this is not allowed

993
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,280
it's illegal

994
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,580
it is edible

995
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:46,080
But it cannot be added to utility oil

996
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:51,180
The leaf filter tree we just saw in nature

997
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,580
The leaf filter tree is a plant that has

998
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,620
A source of many pigments

999
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,620
The other is that compared to plants, they are animals

1000
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,620
what about animals

1001
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,400
is red because blood is red

1002
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,400
that makes these two very different colors

1003
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,400
In fact, its chemistry is very similar

1004
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,700
The following is the main structure of the leaf green tree

1005
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,400
The one above is our red blood cell

1006
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,900
Iron fingers in red blood cells

1007
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,700
Red blood cells should, in fact, also be colorless

1008
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,600
But it contains a thing like this

1009
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,800
This thing is available in red color

1010
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
Do you see that this structure looks very similar to

1011
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,400
Except for the middle this is a beauty

1012
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,600
above is an iron

1013
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,000
different metal

1014
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,800
The structure of Zhongwei is also slightly different

1015
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,800
But the color is so different

1016
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,800
one is red one is green

1017
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,400
This is a newspaper from two or three years ago

1018
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,400
I don't know if you guys still remember

1019
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Looking at the body, it means that there is a daughter-in-law who wants to kill his in-laws

1020
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,700
what did he put in it

1021
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,300
He put a pinch of sour in their meal

1022
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,460
What is subsoleic acid?

1023
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,360
It's the bacon thing

1024
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,360
Sodium nitrite chemical molecule is NANO2

1025
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,160
It's the combination of Assiolic Acid and

1026
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,360
Assona

1027
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,360
This thing is actually an oxidizing agent

1028
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,000
it will eat into the human body

1029
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,660
It will take the ferrous iron in the heme

1030
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,260
the action of oxidation

1031
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,200
Turn Iron Two into Iron Three

1032
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,500
Our human blood must be able to absorb oxygen

1033
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,160
We need oxygen to breathe

1034
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,260
Rely on the second iron frame

1035
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,460
Once the iron two frame is replaced by the iron three frame

1036
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,860
Human blood can no longer absorb oxygen

1037
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,700
so people die

1038
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,260
What are your symptoms?

1039
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,260
Normal blood looks red

1040
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,800
But that's because of the iron content of Iron II

1041
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,060
But if you turn Iron II into Iron III

1042
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,920
What about iron quality at this time?

1043
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,420
It looks darker

1044
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,060
Look at the left and right hands

1045
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,340
It's the color of the hands of the poisoned in-laws

1046
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,640
because its blood can no longer absorb oxygen

1047
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,500
At that time the report said

1048
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,940
It was later discovered that it was because of the poison

1049
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,340
they are in the hospital

1050
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,040
Symptoms of a poisoning like this

1051
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,280
can add this sub

1052
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,040
First

1053
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,440
blue

1054
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,140
this thing

1055
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,540
In fact this is a finite color substance

1056
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,440
This thing can help put this iron shirt rack

1057
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,440
Revert back to Iron Erjia

1058
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,440
In fact, what about this colored substance?

1059
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,540
also a potion

1060
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,040
In fact it can do that oxidative mixing action

1061
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,440
itself it is blue

1062
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,040
you can see it melt in the water

1063
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,140
There is a blue substance in the water

1064
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,440
you go

1065
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,240
If you have to look it up

1066
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,640
you can see it's a chemical indicator

1067
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,940
Also a dye

1068
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,540
because it has a color relationship

1069
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,440
It is also a biological stain

1070
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,740
you can see this above

1071
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,340
The word is the tissue of the human body

1072
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,640
After applying this dye

1073
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,740
You can see it renders this blue

1074
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
presented

1075
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,860
So this release is also a dye thing

1076
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,160
Because as long as there is color, we can call it a dye

1077
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,060
And the dye is actually an antidote

1078
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,600
Once you plant this acesena poison

1079
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,100
Just rely on this to detoxify

1080
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,560
This news report is headline news

1081
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,720
There are several chemicals in it

1082
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,960
includes this dye

1083
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,760
This bacon is included

1084
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,260
In fact, this is our pool of people

1085
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,460
this will be poisonous

1086
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,220
with this leafy green tree or ferrite

1087
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:33,420
a very similar thing

1088
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,420
It's a synthetic thing

1089
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,720
This is a thing that is used a lot in the industry

1090
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,220
Because this is completely produced by synthesis in the laboratory

1091
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,220
These things are also dyes or pigments

1092
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,420
Dye called Taiqinglin

1093
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,420
Or I can see it in

1094
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,920
It's very similar to the ferrous structure

1095
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,420
just in the four corners

1096
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,380
Change this CH to N

1097
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,380
changed to bomb

1098
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,660
The structure of Yuanyuan's large plate still looks exactly the same

1099
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,220
But this color is just like these four eggs

1100
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,160
It's not the same as without these four colors

1101
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,720
Originally, the inside of the iron paper was red.

1102
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,400
If it were changed to beauty, it might be green

1103
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,700
This one has four more eggs and then replaced it with a bucket

1104
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,600
or no bucket

1105
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,600
The color itself is blue

1106
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,000
like this is very blue blue

1107
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
or so this one is bluish

1108
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,200
This type of substance is a pigment dye that is completely functionally synthesized.

1109
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,200
This thing is much more stable than iron paper or these

1110
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:43,720
Such dyes and pigments are widely used in some optoelectronic industries

1111
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,920
Let's come back to the photoelectric application later.

1112
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,000
Next, let's talk about the substance of this color.

1113
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,400
is about this practical pigment

1114
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,360
As we mentioned earlier, Tongye Suna

1115
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,360
That is allowed to be added to the utility

1116
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,360
But it cannot be added to utility oil

1117
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,160
that too

1118
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,400
is a food coloring

1119
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,600
there are many things

1120
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,800
inside what we eat

1121
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,800
In order to increase the vividness of the food

1122
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,800
Usually some coloring is added here

1123
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,800
What is allowed to be added is called

1124
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
Qualified edible artificial coloring

1125
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,700
These edible artificial colors

1126
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,200
Let me give you an example

1127
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,400
I didn't know you liked this hot dog

1128
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,400
This is a very standard hot dog thing

1129
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,800
hot dog with bun

1130
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,000
there is a sausage in it

1131
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,400
Then usually put this ketchup and mustard sauce

1132
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,200
Food coloring is added to mustard, ketchup, and hot dogs

1133
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,000
Because otherwise the colors wouldn't be so bright

1134
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,200
ketchup is red, right?

1135
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,400
Added this orange-red pigment in it

1136
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,200
What about the yellow mustard?

1137
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,000
Added this yellow pigment inside

1138
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,700
There is also this orange-red pigment added to the sausage

1139
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,500
These three pigments are classified according to their chemical structure

1140
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,900
All three are called

1141
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,360
Mouth Tears Dye

1142
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,760
colorful

1143
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,120
one is orange

1144
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,960
one is yellow

1145
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,960
add to this

1146
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,360
Can make your hot fruit look more salivating

1147
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,960
The color is very strong and very bright

1148
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,200
whet your appetite

1149
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,680
something like this

1150
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,880
are also widely used on these planet-colored

1151
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,840
inside the food

1152
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,520
Like this is MMM's chocolate candy

1153
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,200
This is Regan's candy

1154
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,360
Called Jerry Bean

1155
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,560
There are many different colors in the edible drink

1156
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,160
Wind model with pills

1157
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,000
It is usually colored inside

1158
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,960
These edible artificial colors are usually added

1159
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,800
I remember this one is called Marco Dirty

1160
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,200
See various colors inside

1161
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,200
It's all food coloring.

1162
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,400
You can easily find it online

1163
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,320
What are these food colorings?

1164
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,360
these things

1165
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,640
The ones listed above are the pigments of silver Xu in the United States

1166
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,000
Different countries have different banking licenses

1167
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,700
Using the United States as the standard, these chemical structures I have found out

1168
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,000
It's all organic chemicals and they're colored

1169
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Some may be blue, some may be red, yellow, orange

1170
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:18,300
These are allowed to be added to the utility

1171
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,800
substances that add color

1172
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,000
There are also some pigments that come from nature

1173
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,200
For example, astaxanthin

1174
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,200
In fact you can in the pharmaceutical factory

1175
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,700
You can get this at the pharmacy

1176
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:39,200
it's not a drug it's a drug called like a vitamin

1177
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,500
is a tonic thing

1178
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,200
It's sold inside, you can see what's inside this orange-red capsule

1179
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,600
liquid is astaxanthin

1180
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,000
it puts it in oil

1181
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
itself it is cloth body like this one

1182
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,400
very dark orange-red colored powder

1183
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,700
It is also an organic substance

1184
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,200
lots of doubles in it

1185
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Here are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

1186
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
eleven, twelve, thirteen

1187
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,500
From head to tail, fourteen or fifteen double swords

1188
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,000
So the wavelength of its color can be extended to

1189
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,700
within this range of long-wavelength red

1190
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
This thing actually takes tea from nature

1191
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,300
Much more convenient than artificial synthesis

1192
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,600
I'll check it out

1193
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,000
Artificial, like this category, all substances that belong to this category are called

1194
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,400
family of carotenoid trees

1195
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,600
What's Included Beta Carrot Tree

1196
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,800
yellow tree including corn leaves

1197
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,200
What we saw before me looks like this

1198
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,400
This is actually produced from the algae itself

1199
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,200
Obtain the pigment of the shrimp mangrove like this from this algae

1200
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,800
Much simpler than synthetic

1201
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,400
Because the synthesis is more troublesome

1202
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,300
so this thing especially this thing

1203
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,200
We won't be so stupid as to say we synthesize it ourselves in the lab

1204
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Because it will cost more to synthesize it yourself

1205
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,800
to do the synthetic work

1206
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,000
this is

1207
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,300
It is some steps of artificial synthesis

1208
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,600
you see very troublesome

1209
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,700
many steps

1210
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,600
So it's better to go find that naturally

1211
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,500
Looking for a class?

1212
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,000
The convenience of extracting from looking for classes

1213
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,200
What about the same substance?

1214
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,000
Also includes this nightshade tree and carrot tree

1215
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
that yellow

1216
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,700
orange-yellow substance

1217
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,400
All belong to this category

1218
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,800
Substances of this family

1219
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,500
There is another kind of colored

1220
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,500
These are the fruits we often eat

1221
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:31,500
this dark fruit

1222
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,700
like blueberries or grapes

1223
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,200
Eggplant Helizi

1224
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,200
This is a dye that contains the same pigment

1225
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,700
This is called a flower tree

1226
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:48,200
These are usually reddish substances

1227
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,500
What about this flower tree?

1228
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,800
there is another thing

1229
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,700
also often appear

1230
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,800
somewhat similar to that structure

1231
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,700
called the color inside the hydrangea

1232
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,500
hydrangea inside color

1233
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,300
It also contains this anthocyanin tree

1234
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,400
The top of the structure of the anthocyanin tree

1235
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
His color will follow the color of your soil

1236
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Variations in acidity and alkalinity

1237
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
This is a substance that belongs to the color of nature

1238
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
ok this is his time

1239
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
about ten minutes

1240
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
In more than ten minutes, I took the second half of this

1241
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
finish it

1242
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm going to talk about it next

1243
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
These we have talked about so far are called

1244
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
traditional dyeing and finishing process

1245
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
The dyes we use are usually for coloring

1246
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
make things come out in color

1247
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
This is a more traditional approach

1248
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
What about the current technology?

1249
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
actually go one step further

1250
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
We're no longer talking about color

1251
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
We are using some of its photoelectric characteristics

1252
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
same color

1253
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
but we're using it for this

1254
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Inside the optoelectronic components

1255
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
TV-like color rendering

1256
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
The presentation of the color of the mobile phone panel

1257
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Also like what you see here

1258
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
The discs we use to record data

1259
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
These dyes are actually used in it.

1260
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
This is more modern and not traditional

1261
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Let's talk about the traditional dyeing and printing process

1262
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Now it means that it is applied to optoelectronic technology

1263
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Although this technology is a bit outdated

1264
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
But this was considered a very

1265
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
More than ten years ago, twenty years ago, it was considered a very popular new technology

1266
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It is a technology for storing data

1267
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It's the CD.

1268
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
In fact, there is a layer of dye in it.

1269
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Look at this English word, low crooked one means dye

1270
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
In the middle it is a very thin multilayer film

1271
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
One of the layers is the substance of this dye

1272
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
The reason why it can record is that this dye absorbs

1273
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
We need to use a laser light to do the action of burning the road

1274
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
it will absorb this laser light

1275
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And the dye in this place will go bad

1276
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
so need

1277
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,100
Substances that receive laser light

1278
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,700
Laser light is also a kind of light

1279
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,900
a type of visible light

1280
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,900
So this basically needs to rely on dyes

1281
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,800
In order to be able to achieve this application

1282
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,900
well everyone knows this

1283
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,400
There are two types of discs

1284
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,100
One piece is 500Mbz

1285
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,500
For DVD2, it is several Gigabytes larger

1286
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,200
The storage space varies in size

1287
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,900
depending on the dye used in it is not the same

1288
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,800
like the dye used in CD2

1289
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,400
Usually one of these three

1290
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,400
DVD2's dye is a fact

1291
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,400
I can't argue with this information

1292
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,900
Because this is a winter night secret

1293
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,100
wait you will do

1294
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,600
I don't want to tell you what exactly it is used for

1295
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,600
we just know

1296
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,900
It uses these two types of dyes

1297
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,500
Synin's Dye or Azol Metal Dye

1298
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,000
This Azol is what we saw earlier

1299
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Yellow game dye to paint roads

1300
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,700
is one of a kind

1301
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,700
That one is also called Azol Dye

1302
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,100
it just exists

1303
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,960
Hot dog, what, what?

1304
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,760
What about the color in ketchup and mustard?

1305
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,660
It is also a kind of dichotic dye that belongs to the Azure band

1306
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,960
This Traner dye is also used in the production of this DVDR

1307
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,160
Next, this is really about optoelectronic technology.

1308
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,660
The reason why our LCD screen can show color

1309
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,960
In fact, a thing called a color-producing green light film is used in it.

1310
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,220
This is a presentation of complementary colors

1311
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,460
The color-producing green film is to green out the color we don't want

1312
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,620
Then filter out the color we want to see

1313
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:44,920
This is a display of a complementary color that is a color that cancels out

1314
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,920
This green light film needs to use some colored substances

1315
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,720
to absorb the colors we don't want

1316
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,920
For example, the screen display usually has three colors: red, blue and green.

1317
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,080
So if you want to see red, you have to follow blue

1318
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,820
remove the green ones

1319
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,320
So for example like this is a green dye

1320
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,720
the reason it's green

1321
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,160
Because it absorbs red and blue

1322
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:15,520
so a green coloring or dye needs to be used in it

1323
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,360
this is its option

1324
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,200
In the current LCD technology

1325
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,320
The green light film used in this

1326
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,860
What about this green pigment?

1327
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,160
just use this thing

1328
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,360
This is what blue is used for

1329
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,400
This is what we just saw

1330
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,360
this thing

1331
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,400
this thing

1332
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,560
CUPC

1333
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,960
This is one that is produced in millions of metric tons per year

1334
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,160
A very useful coloring used in the craft world

1335
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,960
Because it appears blue or cyan color

1336
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,160
This substance is very stable

1337
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,960
So it can be used on the green light film of this LCD

1338
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,960
This is CUPC

1339
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:57,920
the same substance

1340
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,920
it's a

1341
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,240
a blue pigment

1342
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,160
Red is made of such a substance

1343
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:09,240
This substance is also used in the paint of the car

1344
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,640
orange red we saw that before

1345
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:17,120
Maforomio's baking paint is also used by some companies

1346
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,560
painted on the top of the car

1347
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,160
Because these three pigments are very stable

1348
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,240
It can be stored for a long time without deterioration

1349
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,600
Even under the light of LCE

1350
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,360
it won't break

1351
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:34,400
Therefore, the reason why the LCD screen can present a variety of colors

1352
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,000
With this color filter

1353
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,320
The color filter relies on these three pigments

1354
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:44,840
Red, blue and green pigments to filter out unwanted light colors

1355
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,480
This way you can piece together a variety of

1356
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,840
colorful lin red color

1357
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,280
good this

1358
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,480
we've been talking so far

1359
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,400
Eliminate the application of models or complementary colors

1360
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,960
Include this app in solar tv

1361
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,460
dyes are also used

1362
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,500
This dye also utilizes the erasing type

1363
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:07,160
Or the color of the complementary color appears

1364
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,860
we talked about it from the beginning

1365
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,300
things will show dye

1366
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,100
It's all caused by sunlight

1367
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,160
As long as a certain color of sunlight is absorbed

1368
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,660
This thing will show up in color

1369
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,000
The colors that appear are called complementary colors

1370
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,160
For example, as you see this is translucent

1371
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,660
inside these things

1372
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,260
yellow like this one

1373
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,660
That is, it absorbs the cyan color

1374
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,960
To show its complementary color is to show yellow

1375
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,920
able to appear red

1376
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,000
It is to absorb its protective color

1377
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,420
In this case, it will appear that what is left is the red color.

1378
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,920
This is what we are currently doing research on

1379
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,920
Various colors that are often used

1380
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,920
we are designing

1381
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,820
What color material can absorb sunlight

1382
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,920
The more you absorb sunlight, the more you think about this effect.

1383
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,620
The higher the efficiency of the panel it can battery

1384
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:55,420
So this is a comparison

1385
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,620
The application of a technology that is still in the research stage

1386
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,080
good

1387
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,300
we just talked about so far

1388
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,100
We're talking about what's called an evanescent color representation.

1389
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,800
is what we see is a complementary color

1390
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,400
Next, the last ten or so slides will talk about additive color

1391
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:16,900
A phenomenon in which additive color is opposite to subtractive color

1392
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,700
if we want to see blue

1393
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,700
We are the blue light

1394
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,500
that is blue

1395
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,400
Green light is green

1396
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,200
Red light is red

1397
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,300
All three light colors play together

1398
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,000
what is that

1399
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
just white

1400
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,000
This is an additive color

1401
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,000
red green plus white

1402
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,000
Basically red, yellow green, blue electronic paper

1403
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,800
all added up

1404
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,700
it's sunlight

1405
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,500
So in fact sunlight is also an additive color display

1406
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,600
So what we just said so far

1407
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,900
They're all talking about elimination-type complementary colors

1408
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,900
But we're going back now to the sun at the beginning

1409
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,800
Sunlight is an additive color

1410
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,300
Because the application of matter that we are going to talk about next

1411
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:59,800
Especially the optoelectronic technology industry uses additive colors

1412
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,500
using a luminous substance

1413
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,900
Luminous matter is like the sun

1414
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,400
the sun is something that shines

1415
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,000
Luminous substances are all additive colors

1416
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,400
for example like this

1417
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,000
In the laboratory, some so-called nanoparticles will be made

1418
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,600
This is a nanoparticle made of inorganic material

1419
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,300
Then we talked about it at the beginning

1420
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,300
Color rendering of inorganic materials

1421
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,500
and the size of its constituent elements

1422
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,500
The size of the radius is related to

1423
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,500
So look at the various colors it presents here

1424
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,200
It is caused by the size of the nanoparticle

1425
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,100
The bigger the color, the more reddish it will be

1426
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,200
the smaller you make

1427
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,200
This is towards the blue direction

1428
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,600
but this is

1429
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,600
What you see is an additive color

1430
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,200
it's something that emits light

1431
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:48,300
This material called silver light or aura

1432
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,000
This is the presentation of additive color

1433
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:57,400
Substances that include these long-lasting auras

1434
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,600
It's pretty standard like this

1435
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,720
Silver light, for example, we painted on that clock

1436
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,860
That or the emergency exit thing that lights up

1437
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:10,320
They are all luminous substances composed of these inorganic elements.

1438
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,320
and inside these plastic panels

1439
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,320
something that looks a lot like the light colors of a neon sign

1440
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,000
It's all made of silvery material

1441
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,260
It also includes going to a concert like this or that

1442
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,560
Don't you take two bright sticks?

1443
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:31,280
It's all made of these organic substances that have undergone chemical reactions.

1444
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,180
the light emitted

1445
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,580
seen by our eyes

1446
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,780
What we're talking about here are all so-called additive colors.

1447
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:42,580
Most of the additive colors are composed of silver or aura substances

1448
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,420
There is also a silver light silver light

1449
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:49,620
Where the application of silver light or aura is used

1450
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,980
make your white look whiter

1451
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:55,880
This is used because we people like pure white color very much

1452
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,600
including my sports socks

1453
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,600
be very white

1454
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,600
whiter whiter

1455
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
The better it is, the more beautiful it is

1456
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:09,000
There are also these clothes, you can see that there are these additives in this washing powder

1457
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:13,700
Under ultraviolet light it will appear blue light

1458
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,000
The paper towels used in our toilets are also screw-shaped

1459
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,700
I won't add this thing to hand paper, because it doesn't need to be very white

1460
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,100
Because the paper towels are usually yellowish

1461
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,800
But our print is like this paper

1462
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,700
The paper used for printing should be laid out better

1463
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,500
This fluorescent substance must be added inside

1464
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:33,100
as seen in this picture

1465
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,900
On the right is the hand paper, this is A4 printing paper

1466
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:42,000
A4 printing paper will emit blue light when viewed under ultraviolet light

1467
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,800
this one doesn't

1468
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,400
So in the case of blue light emitted

1469
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,400
This white will look whiter

1470
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:53,500
This is called a fluorescent additive, or a fluorescent whitening agent

1471
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,700
This thing will be used in many places

1472
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,700
Including the paper we just talked about

1473
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,060
Including that cloth like that white one

1474
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,100
to look white

1475
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,660
So it must add this thing

1476
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:07,060
will look whiter

1477
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,660
There are also many electrical supplies like that

1478
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,860
It's inside the white shell

1479
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,560
Added all of these

1480
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,600
The so-called fluorescent whitening agent

1481
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,560
This has an effect of making the white whiter whiter

1482
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,400
Including the white sneakers too

1483
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,060
This fluorescent whitening agent is added to everything.

1484
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,200
The last display

1485
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,060
I will quickly talk about this ten-year relationship

1486
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,820
This has been eliminated

1487
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,920
The display method of impression tube

1488
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,360
It actually uses a lot of this

1489
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,160
fluorescent powder in this

1490
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,620
This is also a display of color called additive

1491
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:44,720
The same is true for TVs including this plasma

1492
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:49,060
All rely on the glow of its fluorescent powder

1493
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:52,220
to present this picture

1494
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:55,660
This is plasma or impression tube

1495
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:59,020
In fact, they have all been eliminated

1496
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,040
there is another

1497
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,700
What this light-emitting display will use is

1498
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,900
We see this LED light bulb everywhere now

1499
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:10,700
This is also a light-emitting photoelectric product

1500
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:15,900
Some semiconductor materials are used in it.

1501
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,100
substances composed of these elements

1502
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:22,100
These substances after passing the current

1503
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,900
it sparks light out

1504
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,500
This phenomenon is called electroluminescence

1505
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,500
Because the substances used here are all inorganic compounds

1506
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,400
You can see that there is no carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in this

1507
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,000
elements in organic matter

1508
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,800
So these substances are inorganic materials

1509
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:45,000
It can be used as a light-emitting material for LED bulbs

1510
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,600
This LED light bulb can also be used as a screen

1511
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,100
This screen is super large and placed on that TV

1512
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,100
It's for the big screen on the wall

1513
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,000
This is like this popular place in Taipei City

1514
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And this is the NASDAQ CPPCC exchange

1515
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,500
150% of this big Taipei City

1516
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,400
They're a video wall six stories high

1517
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,400
are lined up with LED bulbs

1518
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,800
We just looked at a few very common

1519
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,000
flat panel display

1520
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Includes traditional acoustic tubes

1521
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,600
including deprecated

1522
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,000
plasma display

1523
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,800
What still exists is this LCD

1524
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,200
LCD is not an additive color display

1525
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,800
It is a complementary color display

1526
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,800
Because it's light passing through this colored green light sheet

1527
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,600
and filter out the colors we want to see

1528
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,800
This is a complementary color display

1529
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,000
The last thing I want to talk about is a flat panel monitor

1530
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,600
It is the so-called LED made of organic materials.

1531
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:42,400
Just now we saw that this LED is made of inorganic materials

1532
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,400
It is because it is composed of these inorganic elements

1533
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,900
In recent years, it has begun to appear

1534
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,700
It is an electric exposure display made of organic materials

1535
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,400
Where is this display used for?

1536
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,500
Both of these were also eliminated.

1537
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,000
Now

1538
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,840
Only these two things are still available in the market

1539
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,400
Should have killed it didn't kill it

1540
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,000
see next

1541
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,500
This was the front page headline in that newspaper a few years ago

1542
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:15,500
this samsung it spends a lot of money on a full page front page

1543
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,500
when that ad

1544
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,700
because they made this

1545
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,000
This Galaxy Note

1546
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,500
With this Galaxy S smartphone

1547
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,300
What is used here is called organic light-emitting secondary

1548
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,300
Referred to as OLED

1549
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Now this OLED can be made into a 77-inch large electronic machine

1550
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
This one was recently in Las Vegas, USA

1551
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Displayed in the Electronic Communications Exhibition

1552
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
LG shows in this

1553
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,000
Just like an LCD, it can be made into such a large electronic machine

1554
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And it's still made into a curved surface

1555
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,000
very attractive

1556
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Compared with OLD, this LCD has some advantages.

1557
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I won't talk about the time relationship

1558
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,500
Its picture is clearer

1559
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,000
It has a wider viewing angle

1560
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
That camera is still relatively power efficient.

1561
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It also has a relatively large Indian number

1562
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,100
These organic LEs can also be used as white light

1563
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,800
White light means that you add red, blue, and green together

1564
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,300
it will turn white and you can use it for lighting

1565
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:15,100
Just like the energy-saving light bulbs in our house, we can use this instead

1566
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,600
This glowing substance, these are all organic substances

1567
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,700
It must be synthesized in the laboratory

1568
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:28,100
Just like Wayne Perkins synthesized in the laboratory

1569
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,800
He wants to synthesize the medicine of kulin

1570
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,900
At that time, because he couldn't figure it out, he didn't understand the chemistry

1571
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,400
Now we know very well

1572
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,400
It must be designed according to his chemical structure

1573
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,400
Because different chemical structures will show different colors

1574
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,800
Like the one on the right hand side is red and orange

1575
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,600
Yellow and green in the middle and blue on the left

1576
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,700
Different chemical structures will produce different light colors

1577
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,900
Organic light-emitting diodes require a variety of different

1578
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:57,100
Luminous substances to match to make the whole screen

1579
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,200
This is the end

1580
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,020
The second chapter talks a lot because I'm a chemist

1581
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,020
I went to take a few photos in our laboratory

1582
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:08,520
Photos of chemical synthesis for everyone to see

1583
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:11,020
Start with the simplest glass bottle

1584
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:16,220
What we ended up with is this material that glows red

1585
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:20,180
But this red fluorescent material was originally something like this

1586
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:22,060
Reflected to a stage like here

1587
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,900
a can of stuff that becomes usima black

1588
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:27,100
What you want is from inside a can of this usima black

1589
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,100
separate it

1590
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,900
You see this red substance over here

1591
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:34,900
There will be yellow and green fluorescent substances in the same can

1592
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,900
You use this separation technique

1593
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,900
after separating it

1594
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,900
Collect this jar separately

1595
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,900
After removing the solvent

1596
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,900
solid will produce

1597
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,900
We collect it in this glass bottle

1598
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,900
This is a typical chemistry lab

1599
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,900
A practice of synthetic materials

1600
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:55,900
This is what we use modern chemical technology

1601
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,900
Prepare this colored substance by yourself

1602
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,900
It's just that this is an invention

1603
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,120
Its light-type material is the same as that of Perkin William 150 years ago

1604
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,480
Of course it can't be the same

1605
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,400
they don't have that modern equipment

1606
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,480
There is no chemical laboratory like it is available now

1607
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,800
This is an example of our own actual

1608
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,600
We designed and synthesized a chemical substance like this

1609
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,560
it is fluorescent red

1610
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,280
It can be made inside this element of the red OLED

1611
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,000
Is it a pixel like this?

1612
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,480
It is used in Samsung smartphones

1613
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,680
It's just that there are about 600 such things on the panel of the mobile phone

1614
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:41,600
stuffed in here

1615
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,120
Each one is made very small

1616
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,560
So the resolution of this picture can be increased to a very high

1617
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,080
We are not a panel

1618
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,240
We're just demonstrating in the lab that

1619
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,280
we can do it too

1620
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,440
We just made a big one, which is easier to make.

1621
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,280
A real panel phone needs millions of pieces to squeeze it inside

1622
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,040
So each one is made very, very small

1623
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,160
This can be regarded as the summary of the last report of today’s knowledge miss

1624
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,960
I'm talking about dyes from that

1625
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,040
From the traditional dyeing and finishing process

1626
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,840
The inventor is this William Bergin

1627
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,900
We now call him the father of chemical engineering

1628
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:23,040
The production of the original dyes was based on the application of its disappearing color presentation

1629
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,080
Speaking of the application of optoelectronics in the future?

1630
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,160
Everything becomes the presentation of additive colors

1631
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,720
Either subtractive or additive

1632
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,800
These colored substances are used

1633
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,860
One is the color of bone protection

1634
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,680
One is the color of the light it emits

1635
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:44,280
I will talk about the application of this fashionable technology later.

1636
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,340
Includes various panels

1637
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,660
The panel of the mobile phone or the screen of the laptop

1638
01:13:49,660 --> 01:13:53,000
Or now we see that they have done the electronic machine 77 inches

1639
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,340
Such a large electronic screen can be used with these luminous substances

1640
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,060
In addition, it is still in the development stage

1641
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,400
Solar cells are also the last manifestation of the application of these dyes

1642
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,400
This era has progressed from about 150 years ago.

1643
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,400
William Perkins to the present technology transition

1644
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,400
It's actually I think it's unbelievably hot

1645
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,400
You would never have thought to say

1646
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,400
These dyes can be applied to current technologies like these

1647
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,400
Well, it's almost time now

1648
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Ok, thank you Dr. Chen for the wonderful colorful world

1649
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Now you are welcome to ask questions

1650
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
please

1651
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Thank you teacher Caiying for teaching me twice that one should be two lottery draws

1652
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
There should be a problem with improving the color

1653
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
You should also remember if you reversed the color or said that you were bathed

1654
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,460
I see I see so it's too hot girl

1655
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,960
Everything is reflected, what I see is white

1656
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,460
but sometimes i see

1657
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,460
I'll try it if it's a color bomb black

1658
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,960
But obviously there is too much fire shining on it

1659
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,460
I still think it is

1660
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,460
but say so

1661
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,960
It's supposed to be black and suck all the light out

1662
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,960
is it?

1663
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,960
I just want to ask

1664
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,000
why say still

1665
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,960
You said this situation is actually

1666
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,460
It is absorbing and reflecting at the same time

1667
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,460
coexist at the same time

1668
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,460
The example I just gave is very

1669
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,460
The dichotomy is that there is reflection and there is no absorption

1670
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:36,460
Or if there is absorption there is no reflection

1671
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,120
In fact most things are both

1672
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,620
So you're clearly a black thing

1673
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:44,260
You can still see its light reflected

1674
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,120
and its reflection

1675
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,160
Because its surface is very flat

1676
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,920
Very flat surfaces reflect light easily

1677
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,620
But it's transparent again

1678
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:55,820
so it has part of the light

1679
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,320
actually penetrates through

1680
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:59,320
absorbed by its dye

1681
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,040
appear black

1682
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,400
But there is some light

1683
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,440
it doesn't pass through

1684
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,920
it is the surface

1685
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,000
smooth things are reflected

1686
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,840
So you'll see this sickness

1687
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,560
obviously black

1688
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,240
Why can I still see the light reflected?

1689
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:17,340
Then you can send more

1690
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,500
Because like us a kettle keeps filling

1691
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,240
then it will break

1692
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:21,960
The balloon keeps inflating

1693
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,500
will break

1694
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:24,040
that light is energy

1695
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,160
That one assumes the black car is over there

1696
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,200
it's shiny

1697
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,400
Always absorbing, always absorbing, always absorbing

1698
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,000
Why doesn't it seem broken or broken

1699
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,400
Because that energy is not yet big enough

1700
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,700
like that

1701
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,400
But it keeps absorbing light and always absorbing light

1702
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,700
An accompanying series is

1703
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,700
it's getting hotter and hotter

1704
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,800
But it's so hot that it doesn't mean that the temperature keeps going up.

1705
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,600
it goes to a point

1706
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,900
Because the object itself is exposed to sunlight

1707
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,400
exposure to light

1708
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:52,700
it emits heat

1709
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:53,900
it will reach a balance

1710
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,200
It is also dissipating heat

1711
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
light keeps shining

1712
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,700
It also keeps cooling

1713
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:00,000
watch this at last

1714
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,660
The total energy and its released energy will finally reach a balance

1715
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:07,000
For example, most of our experience is

1716
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,500
under the sun

1717
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:13,300
The body of the car will be sunburned, right?

1718
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,500
That temperature is about 50 degrees C

1719
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:20,300
The degree of heat dissipation has something to do with your material.

1720
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,200
Most of them will reach a stage of equilibrium

1721
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:28,000
If you really use very strong light to illuminate, for example, laser light

1722
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:33,300
That heat is far greater than its ability to relax

1723
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,400
Your metal will be melted away, right?

1724
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,500
This depends entirely on whether your input and output have reached a balance

1725
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,200
ask holy teacher

1726
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:52,500
The dyes that everyone sells are for visible light absorption and reflection

1727
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,500
developed

1728
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:56,700
Are there any dyes for invisible light

1729
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,200
have

1730
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,700
have

1731
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,700
I just don't remember saying

1732
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,700
because

1733
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,300
We can't see without light

1734
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:04,860
Today I mainly focus on what we can see with our eyes

1735
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,300
usually visible light

1736
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,740
Then what you're talking about is, for example, the light outside the arc of a mirror.

1737
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,040
Or infrared light and ultraviolet light

1738
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,460
it is also part of the light

1739
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,660
but our eyes can't see

1740
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:17,740
But this one has a dye like this

1741
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,240
If it is a luminous dye

1742
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:25,040
That is, the wavelength of your light should exceed about 700 nanometers

1743
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,440
That is the infrared light, the mirror arc or the outer light of the mirror arc.

1744
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,200
If its wavelength is shorter than about 450

1745
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,200
that becomes ultraviolet light

1746
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,900
Then it's about solar cells

1747
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,680
Because visible light makes up only a small fraction of the

1748
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:42,180
yes

1749
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:44,040
So if it's the dye

1750
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,540
Is it possible to apply in

1751
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,740
Can make full use of solar energy

1752
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:54,140
A visible dye has a wavelength of

1753
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,740
in the range of visible light

1754
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,740
But the sun is actually very wide

1755
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Depends on whether your material is made of organic materials or inorganic materials

1756
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:08,840
Inorganic materials are the solar panels we see on the market now

1757
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:13,000
Those are all composed of thin or inorganic elements

1758
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,620
The range of light absorption is very long

1759
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,200
absorbs in the infrared range

1760
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,080
so yes indeed

1761
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:24,000
We do research in the hope that

1762
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:25,720
Are we using organic materials?

1763
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,480
We just want to say that the range of organic materials that can absorb light

1764
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:33,060
stretch him out into the range of infrared light

1765
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:36,120
But it's not easy to do it with organic materials

1766
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,120
Not as easy to make as inorganic materials

1767
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,280
Ok please finally because

1768
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,200
The four questions

1769
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,160
That is to say, the sun is yellowish in the morning

1770
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,880
What was his eye shadow that was reddish that night

1771
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:58,360
The second one is the spectrum of sunlight and fluorescent lamps

1772
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,760
is it the same

1773
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,080
Isn't there a glass that allows the sunlight to pass through

1774
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:06,400
But fluorescent lamps can't see through

1775
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,940
Is there a way through this

1776
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:11,520
Then the Egyptian you just mentioned is

1777
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,340
The latest synthetic

1778
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,660
you want to hear that topic in england

1779
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,720
again the first human

1780
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,020
Synthetic pigments, these two

1781
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,060
where is the difference

1782
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:24,580
good

1783
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,360
The last one is to say

1784
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,160
black should be

1785
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,960
Easiest to absorb light

1786
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:31,740
But in nature why

1787
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,600
Why is it developed that the nocturnal element is earth-colored to absorb light

1788
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:41,480
No development is black to absorb light

1789
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:45,560
It's fun for me to answer your questions one by one

1790
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,900
the first you say that

1791
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,200
morning dusk

1792
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:55,800
Why is the color of the sun's light different from the color of the light in the middle of the day?

1793
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,340
this fact

1794
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:59,900
It has nothing to do with the material, it's all because

1795
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,560
So the light, the morning light or the yellow light

1796
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,640
it shines on the surface of the earth

1797
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,200
It has to penetrate the thicker atmosphere

1798
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,960
The sun is directly above in the schedule

1799
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,840
the depth of the atmosphere through which the earth passes

1800
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,720
day and dusk, morning and dusk

1801
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,120
The thickness of the atmosphere it penetrates is different

1802
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,040
Are there many in the atmosphere?

1803
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,760
presence of floating particles

1804
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,520
These floating particles and your light, light

1805
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,240
The incoming light, the sun's rays will make some

1806
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,400
phenomenon of diffraction or refraction

1807
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,160
This will make your light the sun's rays

1808
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:44,960
Certain wavelengths of light are particularly intensified

1809
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,680
Some wavelengths of light are particularly weak

1810
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,480
so you would render

1811
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,480
Morning and evening light are different

1812
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,080
this is

1813
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,840
This is actually a physical optics reason

1814
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,040
I'm a chemistry student, in fact I'm not very

1815
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,700
But the first reason you just asked

1816
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:05,000
Basically we interpret it this way

1817
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:08,000
because it passes through the atmosphere at different thicknesses

1818
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,800
There are many floating particles in the atmosphere

1819
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,200
this will diffract

1820
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,200
This existence is an optical phenomenon

1821
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:17,860
will change the wavelength of some part of that sunlight

1822
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,300
Then the second question you asked is

1823
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:22,160
Black

1824
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:23,700
no you asked

1825
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,540
that glass is

1826
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:31,140
Glass sun rays can pass through

1827
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,340
Can the fluorescent lamp work?

1828
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,500
No

1829
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:36,300
you ask a question

1830
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:40,000
Is the light from a fluorescent tube the same as the sun's light?

1831
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:40,940
Is the spectrum

1832
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:41,900
is the same spectrum

1833
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,100
I say different

1834
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,240
is there a way to make a glass

1835
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,800
That is to say, the outside cannot see the inside

1836
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,100
But you can see it from the outside

1837
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:52,740
just according to it

1838
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,140
pure glass no way

1839
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,460
but you can on the surface of the glass

1840
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:00,000
Apply some material to achieve

1841
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
the purpose of this

1842
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,720
For example, the most traditional way is to

1843
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,800
you are like a mirror

1844
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,120
You can add a reflective one inside

1845
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,680
translucent reflector

1846
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,360
You can't see the inside from the outside

1847
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,800
But you can still see the outside

1848
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,960
But when the website

1849
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,440
outside or see inside

1850
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,000
I mean use them sunlight and daylight

1851
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,440
The difference with the spectrum

1852
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,920
That is to say, let the sunlight pass through

1853
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,480
Let the sunlight not see through

1854
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:28,320
As far as the website is concerned, sunlight cannot penetrate through it.

1855
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,920
Even if you throw it outside at night, you can't see inside.

1856
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,920
this is a bit difficult

1857
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,480
because the solar spectrum

1858
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,480
basically covers all the rays

1859
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,320
If you want to let the sun's rays

1860
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,480
If everything penetrates the past

1861
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,720
should say so

1862
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:49,880
Fluorescent Tubes It Doesn't Cover All

1863
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,680
All bands of sunlight

1864
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,920
So you can do a thing

1865
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,680
Limit light from fluorescent tubes

1866
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,200
Penetration does not penetrate

1867
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,040
but you are hard

1868
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,400
make a sun ray

1869
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,000
make a glass plate

1870
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,600
Selectively let the sun's rays penetrate

1871
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:07,700
impenetrable

1872
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,000
Because the solar spectrum is a relatively complete band

1873
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:15,600
On the contrary, it is easier to limit the light of fluorescent tubes

1874
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,100
because it's not all

1875
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:23,000
So you just put some fluorescent tubes

1876
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,200
The material that absorbs fluorescent tubes

1877
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:27,400
sit in the glass

1878
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,400
In this way, the light of the fluorescent tube cannot penetrate

1879
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,300
But the sun is still

1880
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:37,000
Because the sun's rays have a wider range of rays in its spectrum

1881
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,400
But it's not hard to do it the other way around

1882
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,500
I just wish the sun could come in

1883
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,700
it was the time of fluorescent tubes

1884
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,800
It is so that at night, the outside cannot see the inside

1885
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,900
Then why didn't this thing come out?

1886
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,000
Because the spectrum of fluorescent tubes is relatively narrow

1887
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,900
we are easier

1888
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,800
The narrow spectrum makes it impossible to get in and out

1889
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:11,320
But if it is wide, we must make it all to absorb the sun's rays

1890
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,880
Then, of course, sunlight will be absorbed.

1891
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,200
but you can make a tube that absorbs fluorescent light

1892
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,760
but some sun rays remain

1893
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:20,920
not absorbed by it

1894
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,800
do it the other way around

1895
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,800
But it's not easy to do it the other way around

1896
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,320
It is easier for us to limit things with a narrower spectrum

1897
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,720
But there is no way to limit the full spectrum of things

1898
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,320
like this

1899
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,600
Ig2 and that

1900
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,640
Both are actually the first inventions

1901
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,760
But Ig's invention color uses different materials

1902
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,440
Ig2 uses inorganic materials

1903
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,520
Purkin I also use organic materials

1904
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:59,480
Inorganic materials are virtually unchanged in their composition

1905
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:11,220
It is derived from these fine acids, fine acid stones, malachite

1906
01:26:11,220 --> 01:26:16,900
It is made up of atoms or ions of metals

1907
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:21,220
it's just throwing it together and re-creating it

1908
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:24,980
Its composition has not been altered at all

1909
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,380
it just reformulates it

1910
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:29,900
Purkin-Wheel, different

1911
01:26:29,900 --> 01:26:34,900
It is dismantling the original molecule

1912
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:37,540
put it back together again

1913
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,980
That's a chemical reaction

1914
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,740
Although the Egyptians are also doing chemical reactions

1915
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,100
The chemical reaction between the two is not the same

1916
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,780
One is organic synthesis and the other is inorganic synthesis

1917
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:50,860
So if you speak in a broad sense, there is nothing wrong

1918
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:55,660
Egypt can also be said to be the first color to be artificially formulated.

1919
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:59,900
Purkin-Wheel is equal to creating something from scratch

1920
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,560
Invent a new substance

1921
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,680
This is a place where the two are not the same

1922
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,400
We also only call Pokéware the father of chemical engineering

1923
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,000
because it lived in modern times

1924
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,320
The Egyptians made that color at that time

1925
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:21,720
But because it was too early

1926
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,400
There is no way to say that an industry will be produced.

1927
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,400
That era was a bit different

1928
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,000
if the egyptian is later

1929
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,640
Maybe at that time they will also send

1930
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:38,400
At that time, an industrial-scale production of this scale will be developed.

1931
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,400
professor

1932
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,400
that is that black

1933
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,080
Black should be the most absorbing color

1934
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,800
Why Nature Is Green To Absorb That

1935
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,400
Leaf green tree

1936
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:56,400
no

1937
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,400
Black means that several places have been absorbed

1938
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,200
absorbed it, right?

1939
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,760
that's right

1940
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,160
If all the sun's rays are absorbed

1941
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,720
just want it

1942
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,320
All are absorbed everywhere

1943
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,060
just rely on

1944
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,960
by that black substance

1945
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,400
but you can see this nature

1946
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,720
except something is black

1947
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,320
charcoal is black

1948
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,320
Nothing seems black

1949
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:23,000
The charcoal is not actually

1950
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
United speaking is not an organic substance

1951
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,720
As far as we are concerned, there is life and there is no life

1952
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,880
words to distinguish in the future

1953
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,080
so living things

1954
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,520
You'd be hard-pressed to find something all black one at a time

1955
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:41,720
This if you really want to get to the bottom of it

1956
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,480
You may want to ask God about this

1957
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,280
I do not want

1958
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:47,080
it the birth of this life of life

1959
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,680
made of organic matter

1960
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:53,640
But organic matter is rarely seen and said to be completely black

1961
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:59,480
So I am more like this. Did you answer your question?

1962
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,100
That laver is purple

1963
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,600
The pigment absorption of that seaweed

1964
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,800
Can wide and other abilities be entered into the wall at night?

1965
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,700
you asked very well

1966
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,100
That seaweed

1967
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,800
In fact it is because the color is very dark

1968
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,700
after you dilute the color

1969
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:17,200
it's not actually black

1970
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:19,600
it's actually purple

1971
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,000
Otherwise, it wouldn't be called laver.

1972
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,100
It's just because the color is very dark

1973
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:28,300
But you go to analyze its color in fact

1974
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,000
it's not actually black

1975
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
it's actually purple

1976
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,200
of a certain color

1977
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:38,000
OK, ask the professor

1978
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,800
Just now we talked about asking the professor

1979
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,700
Use of Exciting Phosphors and Non-Exciting Phosphors

1980
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:48,100
where is the biggest difference

1981
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,500
There are also pros and cons of both

1982
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,000
Thanks

1983
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:51,400
good

1984
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,800
because of time

1985
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,700
We're going to get it down to that detail

1986
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:56,100
you ask me questions

1987
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,700
In fact, it is my research

1988
01:29:57,700 --> 01:29:59,000
where the expertise is doing

1989
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:09,900
Its priorities actually have their own priorities. Let me first say that what I am best at is organic light-emitting diodes.

1990
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:19,200
The two things lead to a very different manufacturing process. The manufacturing process of organic light-emitting diodes is not like that of inorganic light-emitting diodes.

1991
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:27,600
There will be no high-temperature processing stage, because the materials are different,

1992
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:37,500
It makes all very thin films, and the inorganic must use high heat to perform the fusion action.

1993
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:45,500
Because the material is different, organic actually does not need high temperature, it uses a little temperature, about 100 degrees C is enough,

1994
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:52,900
In fact, inorganic materials need to use 300 or 400 degrees C to make thin films. This is because the manufacturing process is different.

1995
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:58,800
The difference in the manufacturing process will lead to the difference in the equipment you use when making it.

1996
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,940
Using high heat to make films, the equipment is very expensive

1997
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,300
consumes energy

1998
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:10,600
Organic does not require high heat

1999
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,800
So its equipment is different

2000
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,700
Again, because it is not used for high temperature and high heat

2001
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:20,600
so it can sit on this soft board

2002
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,100
Because generally we talk about soft plastic sheets

2003
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,700
You can bend when you sit on a soft surface

2004
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:28,500
Bending Now Everyone's Talking

2005
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,800
The scoopable panel is an attractive application

2006
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,400
Inorganic materials because of the need to use high heat

2007
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,800
so it can't sit on a soft board

2008
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,000
So what about this inorganic LED?

2009
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,800
It can't be made into a curved or fishable display

2010
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,000
no way

2011
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:48,900
Because if you want to be fishable, you must sit on a hard board

2012
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,700
It is due to high heat

2013
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,100
no way to sit on the plastic sheet

2014
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:54,600
The plastic sheet just melts, so there's no way to do that.

2015
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,600
Then there's both because that

2016
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,100
It's a lot of telecommunications

2017
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,600
In fact, there is something different

2018
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:07,000
So it actually varies in efficiency

2019
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,800
And if you talk about the lighting

2020
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,400
There will be some difference in brightness

2021
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:14,200
In terms of efficiency and brightness

2022
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,000
Or is it actually better to be inorganic?

2023
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,100
Organic is worse

2024
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19,400
So each has pros and cons

2025
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:23,700
Also, organic materials are cheaper to make

2026
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,800
inorganic material

2027
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,300
I will use some expensive and rare metals for the net

2028
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,500
that will be more expensive

2029
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,300
So in terms of cost

2030
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:36,400
Organic materials are so-called OLEDs

2031
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,000
cost is cheaper

2032
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,100
But this is entangled again

2033
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,500
That is to say but its organic OLED

2034
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,100
Its efficiency and brightness are relatively poor

2035
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,100
So in order to make up for this efficiency and brightness

2036
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,100
you do more

2037
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:52,500
So it's cheap but not really cheap

2038
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:56,100
This is where many issues are entangled together.

2039
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,700
But basically they have their own strengths

2040
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
right

2041
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,000
right

2042
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,000
right

2043
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
How does this matter in simple terms

2044
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
There are many things involved

2045
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
good

2046
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
later

2047
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Professor I want to ask a simple question

2048
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Is this kind of light-emitting secondary body harmful to health?

2049
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Because I see that mobile phones are becoming more and more common now

2050
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Small-sized big-sized TVs keep getting bigger

2051
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
colorful

2052
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
But my thought is whether it is harmful to our health

2053
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
then if there is harm

2054
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
how much it hurts

2055
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:38,000
This question has been raised by many people

2056
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
In fact it's

2057
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
because it

2058
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Basically the light it emits

2059
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,000
It is very similar to the traditional light

2060
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
If you want to explore carefully, say

2061
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
That

2062
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
what kind of light

2063
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
that is

2064
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,000
it

2065
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
it

2066
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
it

2067
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
it

2068
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,000
it

2069
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
it

2070
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
it

2071
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,000
it

2072
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,000
it

2073
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
it

2074
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
it

2075
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
it

2076
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
it

2077
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
it

2078
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
it

2079
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,000
it

2080
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
it

2081
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
it

2082
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
it

2083
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
it

2084
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,000
it

2085
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
it

2086
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
it

2087
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,960
Is light harmful to the human body more or less

2088
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,120
This is not easy to define clearly

2089
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,040
Generally we talk

2090
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,680
Ultraviolet light can be harmful to our body

2091
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,920
But the traditional glowing things

2092
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,600
It actually has a lot of UV light too

2093
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,200
that for example

2094
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:25,360
As for these relatively modern LED light bulbs

2095
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,440
or that energy saving light bulb

2096
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,280
Its ultraviolet light content is also no more than

2097
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,200
Generally, where do the light bulbs come from?

2098
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,200
Because the light diagrams of the two are actually a bit different

2099
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,440
so its ultraviolet part

2100
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,280
In fact, there is indeed a difference

2101
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:46,160
But the difference between the two

2102
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,040
i don't know

2103
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,440
To what extent is it harmful to human health?

2104
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,320
Of course, if you look like this in any January of this year

2105
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,400
under the sun

2106
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,120
Of course that effect I will often

2107
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,420
will show up

2108
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:05,240
On the contrary, on the contrary, what I will say later is to say

2109
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,540
Current lighting fixtures

2110
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:10,240
Much brighter than traditional lighting fixtures

2111
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:15,300
On the contrary, the damage of this is greater than the amount of ultraviolet light.

2112
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:18,660
Because too much light always hurts the eyes

2113
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:24,120
So now a lot of lighting is changed to LED lighting

2114
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:25,860
That light is very bright, isn't it?

2115
01:35:26,020 --> 01:35:27,860
will be bright enough to dazzle

2116
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:29,540
traditional lamps

2117
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,000
because it's not that bright

2118
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:34,200
So its damage to the eyes is actually relatively slight

2119
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,700
If you look at the intensity of the light

2120
01:35:37,700 --> 01:35:41,500
there would be a worrying place like this

2121
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,900
It takes a long time to be exposed like this

2122
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:47,840
to show this symptom

2123
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:54,040
Is it the so-called light pollution?

2124
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,000
light pollution

2125
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:58,540
It's too bright, just don't look at it if it's too bright

2126
01:35:58,540 --> 01:35:59,960
Why is there so much light on this point

2127
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,220
ok, is there any problem

2128
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:05,900
OK

2129
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,740
How to solve the toxicity of dye

2130
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,260
dye toxicity

2131
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:14,400
you say this these dyes

2132
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,900
In fact, it's more or less toxic.

2133
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,260
How to deal with it

2134
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:22,260
Just like the general dye toxicity solution

2135
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:23,260
Meltase

2136
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:25,260
let red settle

2137
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,260
What method do we use for general dyes

2138
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,680
to analyze to quantify

2139
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,180
that is an analytical tool

2140
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:37,180
to do quantitative testing

2141
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:39,220
For example, what happened to them a while ago?

2142
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,380
Didn't the industry peer ratio have to be analyzed?

2143
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,180
How much is there in it?

2144
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:44,680
is the same method

2145
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:46,680
is using the same method

2146
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:51,180
Food testing for those various ingredients

2147
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:55,180
Some of it is used, Zhi Puyi is doing the inspection

2148
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:58,800
Some are for actual quantitative analysis

2149
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,300
go to assess say

2150
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,600
Inside content of multiple tubes

2151
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,600
the technique is the same

2152
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:07,200
There is no need to rely on any special method

2153
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,800
good

2154
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:13,800
Why does some of the fuel recede and some

2155
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:14,600
oh

2156
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:18,000
That one is destroyed by chemicals

2157
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:20,100
Organic matter is easily explained as

2158
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,500
I also said at the beginning

2159
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,400
The shape of that color is because of its

2160
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:24,700
many double bonds

2161
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,600
Carbon-carbon double bonds accumulate together

2162
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:28,200
After the light shines for a long time

2163
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:30,100
Or after it shines for a long time

2164
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,600
Some of that double bond will be destroyed

2165
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,600
After the double bond is broken

2166
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:35,600
after its number dwindles

2167
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:38,200
its color will disappear completely

2168
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:41,200
That inorganic material is another way of explaining

2169
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:43,400
is its color

2170
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,800
is in fact related to its constituent elements

2171
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,600
Oxidation state is related

2172
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,600
after a long time

2173
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:53,000
Those oxidation states will be oxidized by air

2174
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:53,300
right

2175
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,700
Once its oxidation state is changed

2176
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,800
Its color will also be changed

2177
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,000
that often just disappears

2178
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
This is to see whether it is human pigment dye

2179
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,460
There will be this problem of getting this fading

2180
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:09,460
It's just a matter of time

2181
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:12,460
ok one last question this way in the middle

2182
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:16,460
So, how do you tell the difference between the fluorescent light and the aura?

2183
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:21,460
I could spend an hour explaining to you

2184
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:25,460
This leads to the basic phenomenon of photophysics.

2185
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:30,460
yes in short

2186
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:35,460
The length of life of their light is not the same

2187
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:42,460
Theoretically, they are produced from different states

2188
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:47,460
So if you're going to say what can we do

2189
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,460
eyes can't tell the difference

2190
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:51,460
Because of the difference in the speed of his time

2191
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:54,460
beyond the limits of human vision

2192
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,460
we can't tell the difference

2193
01:38:56,460 --> 01:39:00,460
Which is faster or slower needs to be distinguished by instruments

2194
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,040
There is also their fluorescent light and aura of the same substance

2195
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,340
its wavelength is different

2196
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:10,840
Usually the aura is longer and the fluorescence is shorter

2197
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,340
That also requires you to rely on instruments and equipment to control

2198
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,040
Simultaneously two lights are recorded

2199
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,500
You know that the one with the long wavelength is the aura

2200
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:21,200
The short wavelength is fluorescence

2201
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,500
It can be divided from these two ways

2202
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:27,340
Sorry to ask Professor Lin again

2203
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:30,500
So about the Liao legacy lamp we talked about just now

2204
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:34,340
That is to say, too strong will affect the eyes

2205
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:38,180
To make the lights in our house the best is to say

2206
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:40,540
Use about how much brightness like this

2207
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:43,380
For the upper half of the eyes and then bright enough thank you

2208
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,000
it's very important

2209
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:49,280
I'm not very clear about this

2210
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,300
You might ask your doctor for a better understanding

2211
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:57,300
Because we need different brightness for different occasions

2212
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,740
Right, for example, our weaknesses don't need to be very bright

2213
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,300
because it's time to sleep

2214
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:02,600
but the office

2215
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,600
because we want to see something

2216
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,800
be bright with me

2217
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,600
But the human eye has a limit

2218
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:11,300
Ask the ophthalmologist about the limit

2219
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:12,500
may be clearer

2220
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,400
makes sense thank you

2221
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,300
OK

2222
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:18,200
Our K-A mates really thank you

2223
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:19,400
then our first thank you

2224
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,200
This wonderful interview with Dr. Chen

2225
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,200
thank you all
