1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
I eat vegetables

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,200
I have eaten fruit

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,800
You asked me to eat the whole stock, and I also ate it.

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,200
You said protein, I also eat

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Then why is my health not as good as yours

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that difference

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That small difference means

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now this bento has too few vegetables

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,800
not enough protein

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,000
what is rice

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,200
So I'm going to correct it

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,000
i go home at night

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I just eat back the vegetables I don't have enough

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,600
The fruit I didn't have enough also came back

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
Then he gave me rice

16
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,200
bring some of that

17
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,800
Wheat with Sprouts for Sprinkling

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
I'll just make a small change

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,200
Your body is different from others

20
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Another aspect of vitality is weakness

21
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,600
this weakness and incapacity

22
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,200
and geriatric syndrome

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,400
this phenomenon

24
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,600
so you might be clearer

25
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
how to make quotation

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Enough to live with such vitality

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's another

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,200
compare against us

29
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,000
There may be some younger

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Learn about the aging process

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Changes in our bodies and our bodies

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
younger after middle age

33
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
you can think at this time

34
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,600
how do i keep healthy

35
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,000
So I'll come to Citation in the future

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
I can be at my best

37
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,700
Frailty and disability and geriatric syndrome

38
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,500
Let me tell you about us alone

39
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
How do we humans enter into a disability

40
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
or a weakened state

41
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
And this incapacity and weakness

42
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
what kind of relationship

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,500
So you know what we're talking about today

44
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,500
geriatric syndrome

45
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,000
In fact, it is not a person in his fifties or sixties.

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
problems encountered

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
that you have been very healthy all your life

48
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
no cardiovascular disease

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
nothing sick

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
a situation you will also encounter

51
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
This diagram shows that one of us

52
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,000
a state of aging

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,500
The one who maintains better is this red thread

54
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
stay level all the time

55
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
But if a person with a lot of pain

56
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,000
He's always following this curve

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In other words, his function declined rapidly.

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
not too old

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,500
into a state of weakness

60
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,000
So because he is in a weakened state

61
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It is easy to re-enter incapacitation

62
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to this final stage of life

63
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
stay as strong as possible

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
active state

65
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Then stay at that red line up to the max

66
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
This time of life maintains a final stage

67
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
peak state

68
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,640
good month long month

69
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Then if what is going to drop is in a very short time

70
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,680
if it falls like this

71
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,600
has entered a state of weakness

72
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,920
can you still reply

73
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,040
actually it is possible

74
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,480
you can still work hard

75
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,080
Let your function curve

76
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
come back to the top

77
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,720
Those who rub a little don't be discouraged

78
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,680
ok can use some

79
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,040
way of life style of life

80
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,840
let you reply

81
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,880
Then you walk in a

82
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,720
very good one

83
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,960
on the road to health

84
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,600
That frailty is often associated with chronic disease

85
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,840
are closely related

86
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,120
may cause disability

87
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,040
observed an old man

88
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,680
Usually we say that it is not good for people to be fat

89
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,800
But if you are already fat

90
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,160
If you observe a fat old man

91
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
suddenly lost weight

92
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
just a warning sign

93
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,360
It's a warning sign of weakness

94
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,680
sudden weight loss

95
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,560
often feel exhausted

96
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,080
hand grip is strong enough

97
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,760
I have no strength to hold things

98
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
I don't want to go out

99
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,680
I was going for a walk

100
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
no more walks now

101
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,200
I don't do some things normally

102
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
walking?

103
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
slower and slower

104
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
These phenomena are called asthenia

105
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,520
Basically this is a

106
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,760
Elderly Health Issues

107
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
so i'm talking about

108
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,960
It's really full of problems behind

109
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,080
but i think

110
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,960
People in their fifties and sixties

111
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,000
should start to understand

112
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,560
solve the problem

113
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Even people in their thirties and forties

114
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,760
you can also follow

115
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,240
It can also help your own family

116
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,400
old man inside

117
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,800
Weak hand grip

118
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
walking too slowly

119
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,040
weight loss

120
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,560
always feel tired

121
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,280
decreased physical activity

122
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,800
I don't have the strength and don't want to go out to do it

123
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
three is called weakness

124
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,560
then one or two words

125
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
pre-frailty

126
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,640
In fact, people over the age of sixty-five

127
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,440
we look like this

128
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,480
That is, 60% of them already have

129
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,680
A phenomenon of more than one weakening

130
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
This course of debilitation develops

131
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,160
generally considered

132
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
genetic and environmental factors

133
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,240
It's all related

134
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,160
And these factors

135
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,880
other common interactions

136
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,000
will cause some of our body

137
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,040
cell damage

138
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,760
or a lesion at some molecular level

139
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,120
This damage affects

140
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,480
multiple system organs

141
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,560
drop in some functionality

142
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,480
Contains the brain

143
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,280
endocrine

144
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,880
immunity

145
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,120
muscle heart

146
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,920
Blood vessel

147
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,400
breathing kidney etc.

148
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
after this drop

149
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,000
If not properly such

150
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
a lifestyle

151
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,160
good nutrition

152
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,080
and with

153
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Proper physical activity to maintain your body's muscles

154
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
and cell function

155
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,400
It is easy to develop symptoms of decline

156
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
This is what I just mentioned

157
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,440
when accidents happen

158
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,600
Metabolic Syndrome

159
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,960
I think old people just shouldn't eat too much protein

160
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,360
The burden on the kidneys is too heavy

161
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,320
but i know

162
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,720
This means that many people have such a concept

163
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,400
That is to say, the elderly should not eat too much protein

164
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,040
May be physically taxing

165
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,240
Then I want to tell you that

166
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,720
current scientific literature

167
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,520
Is supporting protein and burning medicine officially

168
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,680
interrelated

169
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,640
It's probably an egg balancing study

170
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,800
that is, discussing a person

171
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,520
how much protein do i give him

172
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,760
and see how much he excretes

173
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,720
Take one more point and the balance will be reached

174
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,680
Most of these studies

175
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,560
Of course there are now

176
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,800
So in order to understand

177
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
How much protein do Taiwanese need to eat?

178
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,280
This method is to say

179
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,920
AI for Nutrients

180
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,080
AI is the so-called appropriate intake

181
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
this is a method

182
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,440
This method is acceptable in nutrition

183
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,320
it means

184
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,200
If you do not have the appropriate data

185
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,080
you just grade

186
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
those who have no problem at all

187
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,800
how much does he eat

188
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Thoughts on this nutrition survey

189
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
let's do the math

190
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,200
We just divide the elderly into

191
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,800
non-attenuated attenuated preamplifier and attenuated

192
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,400
to see

193
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
Just look at the data on the right.

194
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
These elderly people without debilitating diseases

195
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
what is his protein intake

196
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
we see yes

197
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
1.21 per kilogram of body weight

198
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,600
1.22 for men and women

199
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,800
This is a mesogastric

200
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,000
What does mesogastric mean?

201
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
is the most people

202
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
people here

203
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Most of these people are uptake

204
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
we can see the debilitated

205
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Eat less than one gram per kilogram of body weight a day

206
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,200
Pre-failure is centered

207
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,600
Then this number may not mean anything to you

208
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Maybe you see this number and feel nothing

209
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,400
but i want to tell you

210
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,200
Global Recommendations for Protein

211
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,800
almost all have a number

212
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
That number is 1.2

213
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,800
an old man a day

214
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,000
He needs to eat 1.2 grams per kilogram of body weight

215
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,600
you can eat like this

216
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
The American-Japanese Diet Guide

217
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
it is calculated after semen

218
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,200
That is, if you keep eating

219
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,400
All your nutrients will be up to standard

220
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,200
But among

221
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
When middle-aged people are doing this

222
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,560
No one knows that the old man Meigong needs to eat 1.2 grams

223
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,120
19 to 34 years old

224
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,520
If he eats such 1850 calories

225
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,920
Or he eats 2150 to above

226
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
Is his agent worth enough?

227
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,200
Enough 1kg 1.2g is really difficult to produce

228
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,960
Even a 71-year-old

229
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,400
If he eats 1650 calories he will be enough

230
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
But we found that

231
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,480
What if it's on the women's side?

232
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,240
From young women he has some who eat very little

233
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,120
1450 calories only

234
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,480
Some women in their 70s

235
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,160
Only eat 1300 calories

236
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,840
So for those who are older and eat less

237
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,880
His sales value is not enough

238
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,560
Usually there is a general rule

239
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,120
That is if you eat very little people

240
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,680
you are prone to malnutrition

241
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,880
If the entrusted sales value is not enough, it will enter into decline

242
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,000
this stage

243
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,360
talk to the government

244
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,920
you for people who eat less

245
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,720
This dietary advice needs to be modified

246
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,360
otherwise

247
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,680
These people may fall into the proxy for insufficient value

248
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Especially the camp French

249
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,480
Internationally, the most concerned is consignment sales

250
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to address the weakness

251
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Frailty is not only related to protein

252
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is it not related to other nutrients?

253
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We found in the literature

254
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I saw that it is related to many trace elements

255
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And it seems that there is a phenomenon that

256
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Nutrient deficient items

257
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
more words

258
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the greater the chance that the person is debilitated

259
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
other than protein

260
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
lack of literature

261
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
B12 deficiency

262
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
lack of C

263
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
new lack

264
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
have some correlation

265
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
One conjecture might be that

266
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is it just eating too little?

267
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So let's explore further

268
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If an old man in Taiwan has debilitating disease,

269
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
his overall diet

270
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
what is it like

271
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
then let me tell you

272
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is male data

273
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
people with different heat

274
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
he is different

275
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Six categories of this proposal

276
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What are the six categories of recommendations?

277
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Usually when making dietary advice

278
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
or divide food into six broad categories

279
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It means that you have to eat these six categories

280
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And your six categories of food

281
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you eat the portion I suggest you

282
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You have enough nutrients

283
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What about when your calories are low?

284
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Your six categories of advice are less

285
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
Then the whole stock here is our staple food.

286
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,400
That is to say, it is suggested that three bowls of rice may be enough

287
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
But we noticed that these poor people eat a lot

288
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,600
He only needs three bowls

289
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
But he ate three and a half bowls a day

290
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
A normal person eats a little less than what he should eat

291
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
But everyone sees this bean fish meat egg

292
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
the protein

293
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All kinds of meat, eggs, seafood

294
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
This poor man also eats less

295
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Normally, it is the same as the early stage of degeneration

296
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
He is simply over the amount

297
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
But are they too much protein?

298
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,200
Actually they don't have much protein

299
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Another important source of protein is milk

300
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
Then our people don't drink milk

301
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,600
So there's a bunch of protein and a lid missing here.

302
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
So we can see that

303
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If you are a person without decay

304
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,800
Actually your protein is just right

305
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
The amount to eat is to put milk and this silicon together, it is just right

306
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,800
Almost all Taiwanese

307
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
So our bone Su Song is a big problem

308
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
For this male of these people

309
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
less vegetables

310
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Then the fruit didn't meet the standard

311
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
And there is not enough fat

312
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Because most of us young people have too much fat

313
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
but these old people

314
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But the fat did not reach

315
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,600
this grease

316
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
The recommended amount of oil in Taiwan

317
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
the so-called five

318
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,400
very little

319
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,200
But the reason none of them reach is because

320
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
Old people dare not eat too much oil

321
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
So it doesn't have enough calories

322
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
so you can see

323
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,600
A Diet for Frailty

324
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
just a little too much rice

325
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
Not enough eye protein

326
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
not enough milk

327
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
male words

328
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
It seems that the vegetables and fruits are not enough

329
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
low fat

330
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,200
so is a

331
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
all kinds of things are not enough

332
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,400
one case

333
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,800
Well, women have a similar trend

334
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
women we see

335
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,400
is its heat

336
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,600
not that much of a difference

337
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,400
it's basically

338
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,800
Eat much less than men

339
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
weak women too

340
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
she almost ate

341
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
80% full meal

342
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Three bowls is about the same

343
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,600
two points

344
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Two point four bowls are enough

345
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
But she eats almost three bowls of rice

346
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
It also has less protein

347
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,200
I don't drink this milk

348
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
fruit with little fat

349
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,800
rare

350
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Vegetables are eaten more

351
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,200
can feel

352
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
is protein

353
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
indeed a key

354
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Especially the food eaten by Taiwanese

355
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
It's still rice

356
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
Nutrients in it

357
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
are not so rich

358
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
protein doesn't seem to be enough

359
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and fat

360
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
too little too few calories

361
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,000
These are all

362
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Features we know
