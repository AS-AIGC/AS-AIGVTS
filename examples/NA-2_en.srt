1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
don't say rule it all out

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,880
don't do anything

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,040
don't go too far

4
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,320
we're talking about a trend

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,240
What kind of food is the person who chooses

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,560
He's not weak

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Of course, first of all, look at the international

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,680
what kind of information

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,760
because he is so famous

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,240
so almost what disease

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,280
Take it with mediterranean diet

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
let's discuss

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,520
when you were middle-aged

14
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,160
overeating or when old

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,360
long-term intake

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,280
If it is the form of the Mediterranean diet

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,560
Less prone to frailty

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,040
Conversely, if it is a Western diet

19
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,040
Just a lot of red meat burgers vegetarian

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,760
It is easier to suffer from debilitation

21
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,080
This is a study of Westerners

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,880
But after all, there is no way we can combine the Mediterranean diet

23
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,320
apply to Taiwan

24
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,000
learn a little

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,320
but there is no way to completely

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,520
it looks like this

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,560
people eat

28
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,360
It's not about how much you eat

29
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,200
Rather it is the emergence of a form

30
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,760
Suppose I eat a lot of red meat

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,120
I have no room in my stomach for tofu

32
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,240
or fish and shrimp

33
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,960
So food is a way of appearance

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,440
We made such a rule of thumb

35
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,960
Then found a diet mentality

36
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,200
What about Kina?

37
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,240
Eating adequate amounts of plant-based foods

38
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,200
Contains fruits and vegetables

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,840
lotus seed oil

40
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,400
such food and drink

41
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,480
ok so tea is a drink

42
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,000
That will provide phytochemicals

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,080
so apart from what we know

44
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,960
fiber nutrients minerals

45
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,560
There is also a so-called phytochemical

46
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,600
You can see these proteins

47
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,360
is less saturated fat

48
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
We all know that saturated fat causes inflammation

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
when the body is aging

50
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,400
I just talked about the body having a low-grade inflammation

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,120
then this will affect

52
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,840
Your body's protein synthesis

53
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,440
According to the information just now

54
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,120
We organize it like this

55
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,640
just take a look

56
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,080
For the prevention and treatment of senile dementia

57
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,480
Tips for this diet

58
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,640
Moet's disease is a variety of nutrients

59
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,560
The condition of low intake

60
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,040
but other than protein

61
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,760
other these

62
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,680
we really don't know

63
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,480
who is a key factor

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
interventional research

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,380
You observed that first let

66
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,840
Such a thing is given to the weak

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,100
Let's see if he eats well

68
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,980
Anyway, the only thing that can be proven

69
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,640
so what

70
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,140
From the information on the diet form just now,

71
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,080
we just wanted to say

72
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,740
if we follow

73
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,240
This from the US-Japan Dietary Guidelines

74
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,040
This way of taking a balanced diet is recommended for the elderly

75
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,440
What if he does this?

76
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,340
He will first ensure that the nutrients are up to standard

77
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,880
Contains protein will hit the mark

78
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,180
Of course the low calorie one

79
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,680
We're going to tweak the protein

80
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,240
Improved overall nutritional status

81
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,580
may be beneficial

82
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,480
whole body system

83
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,980
Maintenance of function and muscle mass

84
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,940
That's the premise of a hypothesis we made

85
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,540
that is

86
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,340
There is an important element that is

87
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,780
More than 1500 calories

88
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,080
Protein is really okay

89
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,740
But what if it's under 1500 calories?

90
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,980
still need to make some adjustments

91
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,840
This paper only mentions that

92
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,180
If you are someone with different calories

93
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,440
Oh 1300, 1400, 1600 to

94
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,040
The amount of meals everyone eats is slightly different

95
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,180
The protein will go up slowly

96
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,280
vegetable

97
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,140
fruit

98
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,780
besides

99
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,680
our word in taiwan

100
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
what we suggest

101
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,200
The category is stable and has not increased

102
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,840
But on protein and protein

103
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,200
There is a scaling like this

104
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Then like this grease also goes up

105
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
So this data is hard to remember

106
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,680
enter your own data in

107
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,200
then find your combination

108
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,680
you just write it down

109
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
keep for reference

110
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,080
want to look like this

111
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
in the literature

112
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,600
If we look at the international literature

113
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,480
Found this with Shi Zhixixi

114
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
There are quite a lot of related nutrients

115
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
Contains vitamin B complex

116
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,040
Vitamin C Vitamin E Vitamin D

117
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,680
There are also various plant chemicals

118
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
The most notable research it shows is that

119
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,680
It is more certain that it is the intervention of vitamin B group

120
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,760
Vitamin B complex has several B

121
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
Contains folic acid Grain number B2 Grain number B6

122
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
All of these follow

123
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
the synthesis of our neurotransmitters

124
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,520
They use MRI to measure the volume of the brain

125
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
It was found that head and group B

126
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,360
Can significantly slow down shrinkage

127
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,240
is now international

128
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,720
The only study with good results

129
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,520
But we believe this Shi Zhixihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Quality also sees group B when cutting in with nutrients

131
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What about the Nutritional Health Survey?

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It is also found that it is related to this system

133
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's the people with low MMSE scores

134
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
it's basically a lot of stuff

135
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
very low heat

136
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
protein fat with carbohydrates

137
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
B1 B2 B3 is nice

138
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
B6 B12 CDE

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
False Calcium Maxim Zero Iron

140
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Fatty Acid Regardless of Saturated Units

141
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
low in cholesterol and low in fiber

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So here is a phenomenon that appears when people get old

143
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Didn't you usually have heart disease and high cholesterol in the past?

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but by then

145
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You have heart disease, high cholesterol

146
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
At that time, it was not high anymore. They all came down.

147
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So this time is to eat more

148
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
After seeing such a result

149
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think the diet of the last group of the elderly can be integrated

150
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Because the difference between weakening and restraining is not too big

151
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It is these proteins that must be taken care of

152
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
it's probably almost

153
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
low calorie intake

154
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Many macro and trace elements have lower levels of pearls to contain those

155
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,320
something that shouldn't be high

156
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,160
like cholesterol and saturates

157
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,040
We both said we must

158
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
something low

159
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,480
Now instead of saying

160
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,560
your cholesterol but don't limit it

161
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,680
Don't limit the meat

162
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
Because now it's just a matter of eating too little

163
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,280
Well, cognitive function is good

164
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,520
what about the elderly

165
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,640
we just saw

166
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
fresh fruits

167
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,640
Whago Whole Milk

168
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,280
protein rich food

169
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,200
Like a man is fish Han seafood

170
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,280
Women are eggs or soy products

171
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,080
and tea and coffee

172
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,800
a form of sauce

173
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,840
So our Taiwan

174
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,920
with the international

175
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
is very consistent

176
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,400
In the long run, it starts from middle age

177
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,840
Of course you want to prevent

178
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,000
cardiovascular disease

179
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
This kind of thing like three high

180
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
let this risk down

181
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,920
short term

182
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,400
You need to get enough nutrients

183
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
group b is enough

184
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
enough protein

185
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,160
tea or enough

186
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,520
Inside the National Construction Agency's plan

187
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,920
we suggest

188
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,360
The key to housing for geriatric syndrome

189
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,320
Diet content

190
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,480
that is to say the first point

191
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,000
You must balance the six categories

192
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,880
for those who eat less

193
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,000
The allocation of these six categories should be adjusted

194
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
we must emphasize

195
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,040
what i just said

196
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Vegetables, Nuts, Seed Circles, Dairy

197
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,400
and protein-rich foods

198
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
with healthy tea

199
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
In terms of protein, what is better for the elderly?

200
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,000
Fish and seafood, including excuses

201
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,160
Egg Bean Meat

202
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,800
As for meat, less red meat

203
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,320
but it means to say

204
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,560
People who eat less red meat

205
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,360
Other people who eat a lot of meat are good

206
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,920
But let's analyze it carefully

207
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,520
People with fewer lions and less sour meat

208
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,560
did he eat red meat

209
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,680
he still has

210
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
don't say exclude it all

211
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,520
don't do anything

212
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
don't go too far

213
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,280
we're talking about a trend

214
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,040
intervention target

215
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,360
We are doing the same in the community now

216
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
The first time we met an old man

217
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,480
We want to shun his personal heat

218
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,520
Then we understand his six categories of allocation

219
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,960
we are going to tell him

220
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
and then assign it

221
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,160
how to adjust his main meal

222
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,360
Distribution of the four food groups

223
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,320
what is it like

224
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,240
What kind of staple food

225
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,400
Main course

226
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
what kind of vegetables

227
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
what kind of fruit to match

228
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,920
What about the allocation?

229
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,480
we would recommend using some

230
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,960
three-dimensional space

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
plate you can easily understand

232
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
Then we ordinary people

233
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,440
you can buy one

234
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,040
After I got to know it, it took me a while to do yours.

235
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,560
That amount is rooted in your mind

236
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,600
Where do you go out in the future, let alone take it with you

237
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,160
And that means creatively

238
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,480
There are some things you may not normally be used to

239
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,200
You need to have some imagination and creativity

240
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,520
mix it in

241
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Many of our friends are playing this activity all day long

242
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,760
how to play this match how to match

243
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,040
Then post it on Facebook.

244
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,600
Then pass it back and forth in LINE

245
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Very interesting

246
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
This can be turned into an event

247
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,400
For example, a situation in our family is

248
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,320
my mother

249
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,800
My mother is a hundred years old now

250
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
she is also very healthy

251
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
But she does eat less

252
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,800
If there are vegetables left over from lunch or dinner

253
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,320
then we'll collect it

254
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,400
For example, the next morning

255
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,000
i'll chop it up

256
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,240
then with an egg

257
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,640
turn into vegetable eggs

258
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,040
then put it on the sandwich

259
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
For example like this

260
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
then you just make sure it's veggies

261
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
will eat

262
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is an example

263
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If it's fruit, it's me

264
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
My mother only has one appetite a day

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
fruit that can only be eaten once

266
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
She can't eat in the afternoon and evening

267
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
so i must help her with breakfast

268
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
prepare a bowl of fruit

269
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
arrive

270
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
if i go home at noon

271
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll pour her a glass

272
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
100 percent orange juice

273
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
put on the table

274
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
She will see it at noon

275
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
i'm busy

276
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
if i forget

277
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
i go home at night

278
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Arrive home at half past five

279
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll start with a glass of 100 percent orange juice

280
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
or grape juice

281
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
put it over there

282
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
just ask her to drink first

283
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
then wait until i make dinner
