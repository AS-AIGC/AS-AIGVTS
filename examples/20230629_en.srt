1
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,440
Using Xiaoboda to enhance citizens' digital resilience through tools and communities

2
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,600
It is a great honor to have this opportunity to make an opening here today

3
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,920
Then I remember that in the planning of our lecture topics in the first two sessions

4
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,160
We compare the so-called digital resilience issue from the national level

5
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's talk about it, I remember we talked about

6
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,160
Probably a resilience in terms of infrastructure, communications infrastructure

7
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,880
how to do it

8
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,280
So when we talk about oceans, when we talk about satellites, when we talk about war

9
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,640
What are the alternatives and what has the government done to prepare?

10
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,160
Then I think we will also talk about digital resilience in today's session

11
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
But we landed today we landed today

12
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,520
So what we're going to discuss today is

13
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Every citizen at the time of this possible disaster

14
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
or the moment when there may be a war situation in the future

15
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,720
whether before, during or after

16
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,160
what can we do

17
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,880
To build a digital resilience that belongs to this citizen

18
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Jiang Tang is also very honored for this event

19
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
We have invited the Digital Diplomacy Association to be our partner in this

20
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Then I think the Digital Diplomacy Association has been

21
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,600
They're in the middle of this war in Ukraine

22
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
They also made quite a bit of an observation related to this

23
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Then I want to cheer up and wait for it to be included in his sharing.

24
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Let me give you a more detailed introduction

25
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,400
Well I think we're happy with this today

26
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,600
Today we invite this very grassroots group

27
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
whether citizen group media

28
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,900
Or a representative of this tech community or startup

29
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,400
Come to share with you such a topic

30
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,700
Then I think I will first introduce our host for this session

31
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,400
Then for this session we invited this crap Red National Army Chief Operating Officer

32
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,700
The chief operating officer of the National Army used to be the editor-in-chief of the shit

33
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,200
And then there's this Citizens Watch, director of policy at the Congressional Coalition

34
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Then he also participated in editing this shit

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
The Civic Action Guide published a while ago

36
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I also make a small recommendation here

37
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,900
In fact, it is really worth buying the basics

38
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,900
By the way, buy more and give them to relatives and friends

39
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,800
I think I'll put the time behind

40
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Give it to our military operations chief

41
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
The chief operating officer will leave it to you

42
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,300
Thanks

43
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,500
Thank you for the introduction

44
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,600
and today's guests

45
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
There are also friends from the media participating

46
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,500
I didn't think the host would follow the opening

47
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,700
help us lose first

48
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,900
but this is embarrassing

49
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,200
But I think this is a private unit

50
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,500
Different from government departments

51
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I think it's a

52
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,600
Just mentioned a good opening

53
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,700
Like today, I also invited many friends from non-governmental organizations

54
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,100
I think we do things differently

55
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,000
but to some extent

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
we just see the same problem

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,800
some things are

58
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,800
We feel like someone should do it

59
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
but no one does

60
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
we might feel like saying

61
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,000
this thing maybe

62
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
big business to do

63
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
Maybe the government department will do

64
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,640
maybe some people are going to come out and do it

65
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,640
But we may find ourselves saying

66
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,160
Eh, it seems that when no one comes out to do it

67
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,400
we need to know

68
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,880
well you're the one who doesn't

69
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,760
we're going to act like no one

70
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,520
do this first

71
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Start small

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,760
After letting other government departments see

73
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,920
Willingness is to use more resources to invest

74
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
make this thing better

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
Then of course we will talk about this topic today

76
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
I think it's still going back to saying something like

77
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,160
Ukrainian city of Russia

78
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
Ukraine has been more than a year

79
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,080
That doesn't look like it's going to stop yet.

80
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Many people will compare

81
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,760
Some people say that Taiwan and Ukraine

82
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,240
Hey, Taiwan looks a lot like Ukraine

83
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,600
But some people say that Taiwan is very different from Ukraine

84
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,520
Both are right, there are differences

85
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,120
how to say

86
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,040
In fact, we see Ukraine

87
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,000
this is able to block

88
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
This Russian Wu Qing

89
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,280
A very important key is to

90
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,480
It is the power of their democratization

91
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,960
able to play out

92
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,920
Not just the strength of the army

93
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,000
Their democrat morale has improved enough

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
To Party Under Russia's Invasion

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This reminds us of one thing

96
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That is to say, we used to lie on the grass and make some

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Civilian interviews, when it comes to defense-related topics

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
A scholar put forward a very important concept

99
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I think this is a

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Today we're going to be here on this topic

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
a very important reason

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He said war, defense of Taiwan

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
this matter is too important

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
so that what not to just give

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ministry of Defense

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
what does this story tell us

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Today's government departments may generally think of saying

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Who will be responsible if there is a war

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The Ministry of Defense, the barracks are going to be responsible

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Actually not only, not only the Ministry of Defense

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
departments of government like

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This chef is very

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
In fact, many government agencies are responsible for

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Protection of Critical Records Facilities

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Maybe the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of the Interior, etc.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
to join the government

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
overall defense

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Is it the government's responsibility?

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Not really

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Folks are also important

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How civil groups and individuals

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The power of the grassroots

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Improve the defense of Taiwan as a whole

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
very dangerous

125
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,760
This is how to keep

126
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,840
A key to field aggression

127
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,320
and we also know that

128
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,680
People often say that masters are among the people

129
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,520
Does it mean that the government department

130
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,760
sometimes unwilling to do things

131
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,720
Or they are lazy

132
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,600
or something

133
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
Sometimes some ideas belong to government departments

134
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,600
did not think of

135
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,880
Our folk role is to test

136
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,600
give them something different

137
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
let them know say

138
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,080
It turns out that some problems can be solved like this

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
So today of course I am today

140
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
responsible for hosting

141
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,280
but it doesn't mean

142
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,320
This is the most powerful

143
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,600
I think the next few guests

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,840
Actually a very good one

145
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,880
speakers they are many good

146
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,400
I can share with you today

147
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
How to Citizenship Tech

148
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,360
can be used in this corner of our defense of Taiwan

149
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
this plays an important role

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,080
Then let me briefly introduce a few speakers

151
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
that one is the president of the country

152
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
Of course, everyone should go through

153
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,560
Sugui Diplomatic Association

154
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
In fact, in recent years

155
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,800
in online communities

156
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,160
Helped Taiwan to do a lot of things

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,040
let more people know

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,240
Taiwan's Dilemma Internationally

159
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,040
and then we

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What can we do to everyone in the international community

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,540
It is Taiwan Can Help Taiwan Is Helping

162
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,620
Give full play to the visibility of everyone in Taiwan and in the world

163
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,340
Then there is our founder Xu Wulong

164
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,460
It’s also called Haba in reverse, right?

165
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,700
It's that he's actually been a citizen tech all along.

166
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,620
We all call it through some hikes

167
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,040
Some technology and engineering methods allow everyone to participate in politics

168
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,540
like if i'm not mistaken

169
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,340
There was an important one before

170
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,880
and also an interesting project

171
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,180
air box

172
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,180
How to let everyone use the power of the people

173
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,080
to let everyone know

174
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,500
How is the air quality in all parts of Taiwan?

175
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
This is a grassroots force from the bottom up

176
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,340
You can also urge the government to make some policy changes

177
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,500
Then come to the end, of course he still has this director Cai Wencheng Q-SURGE

178
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,180
I think this thing does not matter whether it is a figure in the industry or a politician

179
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,900
know the tool very well.

180
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
We can use this Q-SURGE to understand

181
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,380
What's going on in the community right now?

182
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,300
This matter may not be used anymore

183
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,100
in business or in our political situation

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,280
this mastery of entertainment

185
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,560
Another very important thing is

186
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,160
In addition to shooting and setting up guns in modern warfare

187
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,480
community fake news

188
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,760
can also play an important role

189
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,040
i want to wait maybe

190
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,560
The director will also share with us

191
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,120
What kind of help can Q-Sage provide here?

192
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,920
then we first we first

193
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,000
Let's first ask Guo Jiayou, the wise man, to share with us, shall we?

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,500
Thanks

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:52,020
Hello everyone, distinguished guests, friends online, hello everyone

196
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,600
I am Guo Jiayou, the chairman of Taiwan Digital Diplomacy Association

197
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Then today's words are actually

198
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,960
I want to use some little stories from Ukraine

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Let me share with you that in the war between Ukraine and Russia

200
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,520
What are they doing for their fame?

201
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,820
Because you may have seen news about Ukraine last year

202
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,980
There was a lot of discussion last year that

203
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,820
I'm an ordinary person, what kind of things can I do?

204
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,760
Because what we usually use is on social media

205
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,560
I might share with you what I ate today.

206
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,000
Or what news did you see today?

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,360
Is there any way for something like this to exert any influence?

208
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,640
We will spend 15 minutes today to briefly discuss with you

209
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,840
Then let me briefly introduce why our association started

210
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,160
The project focuses on the defense of the network

211
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,000
First of all, it means that last year we actually

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,100
So the Diplomatic Council has always been on social media

213
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,960
promoting Taiwan and other countries

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,600
partnership, so we usually hang on the Internet naturally

215
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,440
It's almost like this all day to see what's happening on the Internet abroad

216
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,540
Last year, we observed on the Internet that, in fact, Ukrainian

217
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,860
the masses they are very

218
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,160
doing a lot spontaneously

219
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,960
A lot of them will set up their own websites, information websites

220
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,020
In other words, they will initiate some

221
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,840
Some common actions on the Internet

222
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,920
Then we think these things are actually worthy of Taiwan’s reference.

223
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,740
Because he needs the content of these networks

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,800
Vision is planned or vision is

225
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,620
Understand, it's a bit like K-Study, let's start with

226
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,180
Use Ukraine as a mirror, let’s see it first

227
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,560
What kind of cases have they done? In the future, when Taiwan prepares for this, compare

228
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,860
It won't be so busy, so

229
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,640
exist

230
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,440
In the content we focus on, in fact

231
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,000
We are not focusing on fake news

232
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,340
Because of false information, many units in Taiwan are actually doing it

233
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,020
We are more focused on content production

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
how to go

235
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
After identifying fake news

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The part behind you is going

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
to generate from content

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
to fight disinformation

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Let's say there's probably no fake news out there.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You also have to keep making

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
social content on the web

242
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
only you can make

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
People from other countries continue to discuss

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
your situation

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So today's sharing will be more focused on

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's what's on the internet

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
How to make it

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
good

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Civic willfulness is this

250
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Everyone is talking about

251
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
what kind of action

252
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Can be strengthened

253
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
For example, Taiwan's Internet

254
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Citizen willfulness

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
To me, it's civic willfulness

256
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
it's a lot of

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
A thing connected by nodes

258
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
just say everyone

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Everyone is a channel for information dissemination

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You have your own social platform

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You have a network of people around you

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
everyone is one

263
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
node of information dissemination

264
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,040
Then when everyone knows how to do this

265
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,320
When information is disseminated, in fact, many of us

266
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,600
When many dots are connected, he will become a

267
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,520
a net

268
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,120
The more sticky this net is, the more self-willed citizens will be

269
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,080
stronger

270
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,080
That

271
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,200
if we are here we can

272
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,920
Let me share with you about last year

273
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,360
How the Digital Diplomacy Association might be involved in this online community in Ukraine

274
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,160
Let's say there was a meme in Ukraine last year and he was full

275
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,800
The one full of red is called a headache map, that's what they say

276
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,320
My head hurts when I live next to Russia

277
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,840
then we'll be

278
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,120
To do one is to live in

279
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,120
China's side headache also hurts. This meme got about 230,000 likes on the Internet.

280
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,840
That is, everyone started to discuss the situation of Taiwan and the situation of Ukraine.

281
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,280
is it similar

282
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,560
then we are

283
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,760
Beyond the topic of Ukraine

284
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,200
In addition to the topic of Ukraine, there are actually

285
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,120
have done some

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,400
did some political cartoons

287
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,840
We'll do political cartoons in different languages

288
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,040
For example, Lai Qingde visited Honduras before

289
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,640
At that time, Hongdullas was still Taiwan's helper, but now it is not.

290
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,840
In the past, when he was visiting

291
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,640
We made him a political cartoon

292
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,440
So Vice President Lai Qingde and the Vice President of the United States

293
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,160
Put it with the president of Red Durres

294
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,840
In this political cartoon they eat street food in Red Durran together

295
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,320
So we used this political cartoon to send the first message on the Internet saying

296
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,480
It means being good friends with Taiwan

297
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,040
It's like being good friends with the United States

298
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,680
This is the way to spread the word to the people of Central and South America

299
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Those private pictures

300
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,520
Then we'll give it back to the public in the comments

301
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,600
will collect again

302
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,760
Then it will be made into international news

303
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,080
It is to talk more about Taiwan's positive image abroad

304
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,360
that or sometimes

305
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,480
Sometimes when some countries break off diplomatic relations with Taiwan

306
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,000
We'll also start some

307
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,560
Actions on the Internet. For example, Solomon broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2019.

308
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,920
We have initiated some

309
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,120
A series of posts to talk about, although the relationship is broken

310
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,280
But the people of Taiwan and the people of Solomon can still be good friends

311
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,520
It also caused a lot of repercussions in the local area.

312
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,680
So we're doing digital diplomacy and we'll see that

313
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,680
In fact, digital diplomacy is a long-term

314
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,240
Create community content and then influence it in other countries' societies

315
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,280
The public opinion of the masses in other countries, or in other words, to influence the opinions of other countries

316
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,000
It is up to the people of other countries to influence the decision-making of the local government

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,200
So their digital diplomacy is actually in the current

318
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,320
In the online world, it is actually a relatively easy to measure

319
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,360
It has a way to measure its effectiveness and the number of people it reaches

320
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,640
an action like this

321
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,080
So let's go back to last year, let's turn the time forward to last year

322
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,140
February 24th of last year was when Russia began its invasion of Ukraine

323
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,440
What happened to Ukraine's Internet

324
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,540
You can see that the war has not yet started, when it started to be very intense

325
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,360
Here we summarize a little

326
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,440
Three days before the Ukrainian war started their

327
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,020
Some posts by government officials on Twitter

328
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,800
you can see that in fact

329
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,820
exist

330
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,420
72 hours into the war they say their

331
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,540
The digital minister is a bit like their digital department

332
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,820
So I started to appeal to companies all over the world

333
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,680
stop providing services to russia because they are doing illegal intrusion

334
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,760
That is to say their Prime Minister will start to

335
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,060
shout out to the world

336
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,100
then in

337
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,380
In these

338
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,760
In addition to the Ukrainian government’s own posts on the Internet, you can also see various companies

339
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,820
They also tweet

340
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,120
Or through Facebook or various social platforms they start responding

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Views on the Ukraine War

342
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So machine warfare is actually a hybrid type of warfare.

343
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
it's not just in physical wars

344
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This kind of mutual speech on the Internet

345
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
In fact, it will also affect the development of the entire war situation.

346
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Here even companies from various countries have begun to condemn Russia

347
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Then publish it on the Internet like this

348
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, Ukraine actually has a lot of government apps

349
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Then there are also developed

350
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
For example, this missing par

351
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a shorthand in Telegram

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It is to allow the public to go to the

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Repay in this Telegram trap

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
A first-hand view of a situation where they are located

355
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
This is what they digitally don't build

356
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Then I was in February last February

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I have private message my Ukrainian friend

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I asked him how are you doing now?

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
so you are now in ukraine

360
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Is there anything I need help with?

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
My Ukrainian friend replied

362
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,400
In fact, he thinks that as long as the atrocities of Russia can be spread

363
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,200
Letting more people know is the biggest help for them

364
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Because they actually

365
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,800
It is difficult for us to contact them directly

366
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
but we have internet

367
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,000
when we have internet

368
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We can help our friends in Ukraine

369
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,200
spread this information

370
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,800
What can you do after it spreads out?

371
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Because more and more people will discuss

372
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,400
will push the governments of various countries to start formalizing this issue

373
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,200
The governments of various countries will impose sanctions on Russia

374
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,800
the community actually

375
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,600
The community as a small brother's big combat tool

376
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,200
Then we will share with you today

377
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,400
In other words, it is used by communities between Taiwan and Ukraine

378
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,800
What is the difference between us

379
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,400
or did something different

380
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
good

381
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
the whole world

382
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,800
What the whole world does with the community is actually what he basically wants

383
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Do your best to help Ukraine spread the message

384
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Because in war, there is one very important thing

385
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,280
is to build a value alliance

386
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,800
Then you have to go to all the Internet to discuss this matter

387
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,480
pull to the same side as you feel saying

388
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,080
He agrees with you in this war

389
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,560
legitimacy and morality, so the community can spread

390
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,400
your values ​​spread your values ​​and go

391
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
A platform to influence public opinion

392
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,600
For example, the previous icon has to be

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,400
The domain of the former Soviet Union was removed, and this is also in

394
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,400
One made after some discussions on the Internet

395
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
A decision looks like this or in

396
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
There are many politicians in Ukraine and they will go

397
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,400
will go for a specific specific event to happen

398
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
You can see that in these

399
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That is, in the speeches of politicians, they are actually targeting

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,640
They are actually targeting that, that is what international organizations are doing.

401
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,000
International organizations are making a call

402
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,320
can help me next page thanks

403
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,400
So here’s what you can say to him on social media

404
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,480
For example, if there are people from Ukraine, they will contact Beckham

405
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,280
Then they borrowed Beckham's IG

406
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,160
Then convey the battle situation in the Ukrainian hospital

407
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,840
Because Beckham has a lot of traffic

408
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,680
It is said that this post has been seen by 4 million people

409
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,040
So they use different social platforms

410
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,520
Or to work with different hospital leaders

411
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,800
Then go to convey the content they have done and find the right channel to spread it out

412
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,960
ok help me next page thanks

413
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,360
So what did Ukraine do with the community?

414
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,560
In fact, they are mainly in Ukraine to maintain the popularity of a community

415
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,000
Because their worst fear is that the world won't talk about them

416
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,840
when they are not discussed

417
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,160
They are a state of isolation

418
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,540
So Ukrainians use community

419
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,140
The main thing they do is

420
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,860
To maintain the enthusiasm of a community

421
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,800
can you help me with the next one thanks

422
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,440
Then their posts are actually

423
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,400
You can see that they actually have

424
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,900
Whether it's an emotional post

425
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,240
or more informative posts

426
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,200
In fact, their request for publication will

427
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,740
The request for posting will be different

428
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,100
sometimes they do memes

429
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,900
Will make meme maps or will make some

430
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,140
Comparison of photos before and after the war

431
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,540
that is a more emotional

432
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,300
It's a way of posting to arouse public awareness

433
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,900
can help me next page

434
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,200
There are more informational posts

435
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,440
For example, the government will issue an announcement saying

436
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,940
What are the methods of disinformation commonly used in Russia?

437
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,040
Or where is the current supply spreading?

438
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,700
So there are some more informative posts

439
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,100
In the communication of the community, it doesn’t matter whether it is

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,640
informational or emotional hearing

441
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,160
Both are needed

442
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,080
ok help me next page

443
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,640
Then I actually think that the Ukrainian government or the masses

444
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,000
They know how to express their needs through the community

445
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,040
Because you have to express your needs before you know how to say

446
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,160
That is, the foreign government or the masses abroad

447
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,840
how to help

448
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,480
can help me next page

449
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,720
And then to the one who just said that they're actually pretty good at going

450
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,760
They are very good at cooperating with some overseas opinion leaders

451
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,440
For example Stephen King made a post for them

452
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,080
This traffic is very high

453
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,520
ok help me next page

454
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,400
to that

455
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,560
I just mentioned that the masses in Ukraine are very good at expressing their needs

456
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,440
Let's say there is a website called supportUkrain

457
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,720
This website is actually open to foreigners

458
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,480
It's open to foreigners who want to support Ukraine

459
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,920
It tells you that in fact you have a lot of ways

460
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,840
Can go to help people in Ukraine no matter what

461
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,560
Say asylum or say you want to donate

462
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,160
Or you're going to be a volunteer and you're going to help them do translations

463
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,440
or you want his

464
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,800
That is, you have to provide all kinds of organizational contacts, and he integrates all of them into

465
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,140
All in one website

466
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,900
That

467
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,680
He even said he would

468
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,960
different

469
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,020
post he will too

470
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,360
Put him all together, that is, his actions on the Internet, he also integrates him

471
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,720
Before that, you may have heard that the Ukrainian people proposed to go to

472
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,520
Under the Google Map of Russia

473
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,420
Go leave a comment because the people of Russia didn't know their country was at war when they first attended

474
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:39,920
so

475
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,700
at that time

476
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,760
Villagers in Ukraine launched a gambling operation called Go

477
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,820
Google Map of Russia

478
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,940
This left a message today, so he also put this online action on this website, which means saying

479
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,980
You just go to this site and you can

480
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,220
click into various

481
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,780
Participate in some actions on the Internet

482
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,060
very convenient

483
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,800
ok help me next page

484
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,520
Then in this case, we are still talking about Telegram

485
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,600
That is, everyone can see that Telegram is in the war between black and evil

486
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,320
actually played a very important role

487
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,960
Because in the war between black and evil, there are actually Telegram groups

488
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,200
He's growing at about the same rate as before.

489
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,760
Six times as much as when there was no war

490
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,120
He has new groups every day

491
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
to provide new information

492
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,160
would say he would have a different newsgroup

493
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,720
I can exchange messages with you

494
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,760
There are also many foreigners

495
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,000
They participate in these Telegrams

496
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,360
To provide assistance or to get first-hand information

497
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,480
In fact, the most important thing for us to do online content is to

498
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,960
to create or to find new pipelines

499
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,480
Bring the news that is originally in the country to the foreign country

500
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,000
ok help me next page

501
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,960
So what did the Taiwanese use the community to do?

502
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,880
The Taiwanese actually did quite a lot

503
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,720
Just last year, I actually did quite a lot of interesting things

504
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,400
can help me next page

505
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,960
Let's say we are the presidential palace

506
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,240
There is a Ukrainian blue flower

507
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,920
is to express a profound support for Ukraine

508
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
then on the next page thanks

509
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,120
Before our association made a picture called

510
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
That is, Taiwan stands with Ukraine

511
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
This is a picture of black bear and white he

512
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,920
Black bear represents Taiwan and Bai He represents Ukraine

513
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Then we call on netizens to post this picture on various

514
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,120
Posted under the tweets of various Ukrainian politicians

515
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,920
Just leave a message to express an emotional support

516
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,120
Then this picture has more than 4,000 netizens who came to like it

517
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,080
is that we take a network action to express

518
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
So Taiwan stands with Ukraine

519
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
can help me next page thanks

520
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
Then we also observed that

521
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,080
In fact, Taiwanese netizens are very concerned about Ukraine

522
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Let's say in the first week of the war

523
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
One of our Ukrainian friends sent us a photo

524
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
He is a blogger who has been to Taiwan

525
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,080
He just likes it and says I'm still safe in Ukraine

526
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,080
At that time, there were probably more than a thousand Taiwanese netizens who liked it

527
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,080
In fact, this network has

528
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,160
The interesting thing is that even though you don't know him at all and you haven't met him

529
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,240
But because out of a humanitarian concern that everyone is human

530
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,640
So you'll be safe as long as you see there are Ukrainians

531
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,560
In fact, you will create a link with him through this posting net.

532
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,720
can help me next page

533
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,760
That's right, we're actually helping too.

534
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,360
Our association also often assists the Ukrainian community in Taiwan to forward some news

535
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,440
Because they want to raise funds with the general public in Taiwan

536
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,480
Or call on the people to take to the streets to support

537
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,880
To support Ukraine, this is our association to help forward a message

538
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,840
can help me next page

539
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,560
Then in the NFT part, there are actually a lot of creative activities on the Internet

540
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,840
It's a fundraiser for Ukraine.

541
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,480
Fundraising for Ukraine

542
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,840
Even though the amount last year was not very high

543
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,560
But I think that is a new attempt by the Taiwanese community

544
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,160
As far as NFT can be used for a charity-related fundraising operation

545
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,040
there are many people

546
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,080
willing to participate

547
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,520
ok help me next page

548
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,600
In these matters, Ukraine gave Taiwan

549
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,200
what a revelation

550
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,520
Revelation, in fact, we can see that

551
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,880
Everyone in Ukraine

552
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,880
The most important thing is to find a channel to spread the message

553
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,560
Those things he he is not

554
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,560
When something happens, you go find it

555
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,880
It’s fine, he’s normal, so he needs to get ready slowly.

556
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,760
Or writing content or doing dissemination

557
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,120
This kind of work also needs

558
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,920
through daily practice

559
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,720
And to think about these themes

560
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,240
That needs to be prepared in advance.

561
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,720
So we talk about transition from peace to war

562
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,160
Normal and temporary conversion

563
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,800
ok help me next page

564
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,400
we are in this year

565
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,680
Taiwan has done one

566
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,720
The group screen project of Taiwan Community Guardian

567
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,320
then we just want to say

568
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,600
can come to upgrade

569
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,880
Taiwan's Cyber ​​Operations Propagation Capabilities

570
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,040
then we are not fake news

571
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,240
Because fake news is really a lot of people doing it

572
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
in our opinion

573
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,000
A small piece of Taiwan is what is needed

574
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,760
Let's discuss what we are going to do in this special war period

575
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,920
Know how to do this kind of communication work

576
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,560
In this dissemination work, whether it is to make a report on domestic information

577
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,800
Integrate, or in other words, foreign countries, is to make Taiwan's situation external

578
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,600
Communication maintains a degree of discussion throughout the international community

579
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,160
These need to be cultivated slowly

580
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,800
So we have a plan to launch a group screen this year

581
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,840
can help me next page

582
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,560
The group screen project is very grateful to more than 400 donors this year

583
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,320
There is a plan to support this

584
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,840
So we are doing a series of courses this year

585
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,520
can help me next page

586
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,040
We have a series of courses this year

587
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,480
That is for friends in different professional fields

588
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,680
So let's go and create communication courses that belong to different professional fields.

589
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,280
Then we are also developing a set of card games at the same time

590
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,680
Well, this card game is actually for everyone to play different roles.

591
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,600
Role

592
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,160
like when a war breaks out

593
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
If you are usually a marketing communication person

594
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
you are usually an engineer

595
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
or you are usually a teacher

596
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
you are in such a situation

597
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
what can everyone do

598
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
For example, if you are usually a teacher

599
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You may have to teach teachers in our courses

600
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
In the final analysis, how to improve students

601
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Ability to make media attempts or information interpretation

602
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
There are actually different characters in this card game

603
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
For example, there is another character called Overseas Taiwanese

604
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
The role of overseas Taiwanese

605
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
We will teach you in the course

606
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Say if you are a study abroad student today

607
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
or Taiwanese working overseas

608
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
How do you contact the local government media

609
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Or to help with a translation job

610
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So everyone can play in this card game

611
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
or in our online courses

612
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You can find different positions that may belong to you

613
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
or role

614
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
to do simulations to make predictions

615
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,120
To rehearse the communication operations on the Internet in advance

616
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,340
How to proceed like this

617
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
OK, you can help me on the next page

618
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,840
that this is the last page

619
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,320
It's the conclusion, simply put

620
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,120
Cognitive warfare is actually a

621
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,800
Topics that cannot be ignored in Taiwan

622
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,520
It happens in our daily life

623
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,200
Our daily life is

624
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,920
need to identify information

625
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,600
In addition to identifying information

626
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,160
Become a Disseminator of Information

627
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,200
and being able to produce content from people

628
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,760
This is one of the ways to raise the awareness of Taiwanese citizens

629
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,560
That's what I want to share with you the most today

630
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,440
ok help me last page

631
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,880
If you are online

632
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,120
If you are interested, you can go to our fan page

633
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,040
You can go to our fan special

634
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,840
is to refer to the digital diplomacy action plan

635
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,800
Then our IG and Twitter are both DG Diplo Lab

636
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,760
That or you have more questions

637
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,440
or have something to discuss

638
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,000
You can remember our Email

639
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
probably over here thanks

640
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Then we are very grateful to Chairman Guo for his sharing just now.

641
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I think the game just now was just the board game

642
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I just remind you that there is a design

643
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
There seem to be many characters

644
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
That actually represents different people in our society.

645
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Then each of us might want to say

646
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It seems that the war is far away from me

647
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
or a real war

648
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I can't seem to do it when

649
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
But I think this reminder just now is the discovery

650
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Not really

651
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
everyone at their job

652
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
One of your usual professional abilities

653
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
both may be available in time of war

654
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
let's play some roles

655
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Let's be able to have some of this for the defense of Taiwan

656
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
helpful place

657
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That just mentioned a lot of points

658
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Talking Screen Battle Transformation

659
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
sometimes what is needed in wartime

660
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It may be necessary to prepare in advance

661
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Maybe it's not a wartime application

662
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But you have to put this function first

663
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
some infrastructure to design

664
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
so i think next

665
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
also the next speaker

666
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
In fact, this is a very important reason

667
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The previous Guo Dizhang mentioned

668
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Ukraine seems to be making an App

669
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
so that they can temporarily

670
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Like can do something like identify the position of the enemy

671
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Or let ordinary people know some situations

672
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You can use that App to repay

673
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
As far as Taiwan is concerned, as far as we know

674
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Seems like the government doesn't have one like this

675
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
A digital tool that can be used by everyone

676
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It doesn't matter if the government doesn't do it

677
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The great thing about Taiwan is that

678
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Our masters are among the people

679
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Folks can do it

680
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I think this is just wait a minute we're going to ask for this

681
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The place dad wants to share with us

682
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
What kind of way did he use to let us Taiwan

683
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
own folk have a tool

684
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
can be a digital tool

685
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
come and do a potential

686
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Maybe for now we can take one of the apps

687
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Effectively identify the enemy or this

688
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The method of group combat comes to us next please

689
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Thank you Dad

690
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
so everyone can do

691
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I will use my left palm

692
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
try it first

693
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
wow, there's a nice screen on the front

694
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Hello everyone, I am Abba

695
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The front side, eh, the header video won’t come out

696
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That's okay, I'll just watch it

697
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
what did you think

698
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It doesn't matter

699
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
oh yes

700
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
eh yes

701
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
good

702
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
then i will start

703
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Hello everyone, I am Abba

704
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Saints call me Abba

705
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
My real name is Xu Wulong

706
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Then the first page of this head video

707
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Its upper left corner is C700NAM

708
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It means that this file is public

709
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
so if given the chance

710
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Then please host this header video

711
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
can share with everyone

712
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The QR code in the lower right corner is

713
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
All relevant information scan this QR code

714
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Just put it in your mouth and there will be

715
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
ok then let's start

716
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Okay, I'm going to start off by sharing a little bit

717
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
some fumbling agendas of my own

718
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I think

719
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
From these years we know

720
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Three needles have a chance

721
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
To be honest, I was very worried at first.

722
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
The more you worry the more you want to know

723
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The more you understand, the more you worry

724
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but you keep watching

725
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
like my own case is

726
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
you're worried you'll want to see what's going on

727
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
What is the status of the input

728
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
To put it simply, for example, should we flee or should we defend?

729
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
This is the basic question

730
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I can't bear it, so I should run away, right?

731
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
But when you get to know more

732
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Like I just said, I get to know more

733
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
In fact, besides worrying

734
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
In fact, you will find that there is really very little you can do

735
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Because each of these things seems to be a big thing

736
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It's like the president or something

737
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
to be able to handle things that the government can handle

738
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
what does that have to do with us

739
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
but you slowly find

740
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,500
You will watch for a long time and you will find out that

741
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
In fact, this can't work.

742
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,000
what's the use of worrying

743
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
most importantly

744
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
my idea is this

745
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,500
don't worry if you want

746
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
So if you're worried then you have to do something

747
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,000
So I'm here to appeal to you by the way

748
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,500
the importance of action

749
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
must take action

750
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
whatever you do whatever

751
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
you just start doing it

752
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,000
naturally less worry

753
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's what I think

754
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
In the process of groping

755
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,500
first thing is this

756
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,000
You have to find a way and take action

757
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,500
But the first problem you will encounter is

758
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
You really don't know what you can do

759
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
You say like we engage in community

760
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
You said I can for war something

761
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Yes, but the war is not here yet

762
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
What are you going for war for?

763
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
what do you want to notify

764
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Then take a long time to learn

765
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
second thing i found

766
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
In fact, you only need the second thing

767
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
It's about finding a partner

768
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Intentional organization works well

769
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
In fact, I have only entered this process.

770
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
it's been a long time

771
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
That is to say, it took you a long time to find out

772
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
In fact, the most important thing for you is

773
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
just to find those friends

774
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,500
or someone with a heart

775
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,300
you will feel very strange

776
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,000
There seems to be worried person

777
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
but you don't know who he is

778
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,700
Okay, so actually let's say later go to the black bear

779
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,300
you will find

780
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,000
In fact, many caring people

781
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,600
a lot of people with a lot of heart doing a lot of things

782
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,800
but you yourself behind the screen

783
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,400
or how

784
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,500
In fact, it is not easy for you to find out

785
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,800
but you just get out

786
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,200
went to an event or two

787
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,800
you will find

788
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
In fact, there are many people who are very close to you

789
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,100
And everyone is doing a little bit of everything

790
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,300
and when you find out

791
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,700
when you start doing something

792
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,800
your friends

793
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,300
he will appear very strange

794
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,400
like these today

795
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,600
many do not know

796
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,300
Why have we been in touch before?

797
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,700
that's it

798
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,500
that he is not alone

799
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,800
It's just that everyone compares

800
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,600
That is, the Low profile is relatively indifferent

801
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,900
So the second thing is

802
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
you like me my basic advice

803
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,600
is that you may say black bear

804
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,700
or other activities of private houses

805
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,300
you just try to participate

806
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,400
you will find

807
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,700
this pipe will be fine

808
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,500
and most importantly

809
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,760
The most important thing is to say that we speak from a personal perspective

810
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,500
when war really happens

811
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,420
you really need friends

812
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,460
just need pipes

813
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,520
just need information

814
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,860
just need these things

815
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,860
But you usually know these people

816
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,360
or have access to these organizations

817
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,900
What you get is the best and most first-hand information

818
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,560
So this usually has to be cultivated

819
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,860
Actually the last thing

820
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
It means you have to play your part

821
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,600
that is

822
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,400
20 million people, you have 20 million copies for 20 million people

823
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,860
You don't have to think too much about what the government should do

824
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Actually, I think that thing is for me

825
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,360
Instead of telling people who to do

826
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,860
what should you do what organization do what government do

827
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,860
why don't you think about what you should do

828
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,860
You protect yourself, these are the most basic

829
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,860
So it's important that you do your part

830
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,860
what is that strength

831
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,860
You have to define yourself to find

832
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,360
like i say

833
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,860
Find the angle that suits you best

834
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Is my information strong?

835
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,360
Then of course I will start from the information

836
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,860
you like me going to black bears

837
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,500
he has ambulance

838
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,340
I'm not good at first aid, am I?

839
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,700
You asked me to move people, I don’t want to move others, it’s fine

840
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,000
Yes, that's why you will find it strange

841
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,500
I have been engaged in information for so long, so of course it is not very good for me to come out and play a role like an information soldier

842
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,000
So the information warfare aspect is something I can ponder.

843
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So my goal this year is to teach Black Bear all the information warfare courses.

844
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Right, then there may be more professional scholars

845
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,500
means find something you can do

846
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
I just want to let everyone know

847
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
In fact, the process should be very similar for everyone.

848
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Then this is an introduction I gave you at the beginning, it is my own exploration experience

849
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Alright, today's topic is some flexible use of Atec's digital willfulness

850
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,500
Well, first of all, let me tell you, please play the video for me, okay?

851
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,500
First let me show you what is called Atec

852
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Okay, this is a wait, it's an Atec one

853
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
his demo video

854
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,140
he is an american

855
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,340
A combat software used by American soldiers

856
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,440
This is so clear

857
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,980
You can see he's used by GIs

858
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,740
But actually we can also use

859
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,640
Then he is very powerful

860
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,440
Yes, he is already an actual combat base

861
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,300
You see he is battle proven

862
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,640
That is to say, he is the actual combat base

863
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
he is available

864
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,800
Not just toys or just games

865
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,640
He's something that can really be used in battle

866
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,140
Simply put, this is one of the American soldiers.

867
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,640
combat software

868
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,740
You can see he has a base map

869
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,140
You can switch between various basemaps

870
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,840
you can see he can know

871
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,140
This is 3D

872
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,240
He can see 3D on his screen

873
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,940
Each team can be seen on the map

874
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,240
Can measure distance

875
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,040
This is the position of each team

876
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:59,180
then this is the weather

877
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,040
he can

878
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,700
Incorporate current weather information

879
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,400
then this is

880
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,300
this is

881
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,300
Don't be like a camera or a drone's image

882
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,400
will directly see

883
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,600
So this is what it looks like when a lot of people are moving

884
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,800
This is actually used in combat

885
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
He has a lot of combinations

886
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,600
hardware

887
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,200
You can see that there are a lot of icones here

888
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,400
Then he is the standard interface of the US military

889
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,800
so everyone you see

890
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
will have the same meaning

891
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,300
Here is the comparison of all high-level

892
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,200
After you are blocked by three in a certain position

893
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,300
what else can you see

894
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,100
Well, this is a bit like task assignment.

895
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,500
the location of everyone in

896
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,200
or the angle of a certain war zone

897
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:15,400
This is all the points, every running line, all the information on the line is available

898
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,900
Communication interface, he can communicate with other people at any time

899
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:27,900
This is a drama, because he is a combat software, so you need to know where others are, where they are, and where they are defending

900
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:37,900
This is from a drone, what the drone sees

901
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:09,000
ok no more

902
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Okay, the software I just looked at

903
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Of course it's very cool, the video statement just now

904
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Tell me this sounds like I developed it

905
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Don't get this wrong, it was developed by the US military

906
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
related to us

907
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Well, actually, I think we should talk about this

908
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Its first thing is that just what does it matter to me

909
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I can't use anything from the US military.

910
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Then what shall I say today?

911
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
What does digital humanity have to do with me?

912
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Only when there is a relationship

913
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
ok this start

914
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
What was that 3.6 Pro just now?

915
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That's the video just now

916
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Simply put it is

917
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
GI Live Combat Software

918
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Stable and safe through the field test

919
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Suitable for battle crystals

920
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Everything about it is U.S. military standard

921
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
ok what does that have to do with us

922
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
first thing

923
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
it is actually

924
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,300
like open source

925
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,660
If you have an Android phone, you can

926
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,420
You can go directly to download and install

927
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,140
So you just wait and install it straight away

928
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,140
That

929
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,500
That's because it's open source and free

930
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,560
So those things you just saw

931
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,580
Actually eighty to ninety percent

932
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,460
You're on your own Android phone and you're ready to go

933
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,880
so i'm not telling you a

934
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,380
an advanced thing far away no

935
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,820
I'm talking to you about something you can use on your phone in ten minutes

936
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,100
and it's free

937
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,060
ok what else does it have

938
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,580
It has wind tag and itag so you iOS

939
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,420
In fact, Windows can also be used, but it is not recommended

940
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,600
Basically you use the Android

941
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:40,960
good that

942
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,420
then you can imagine it that thing

943
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,860
if not in combat

944
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,820
What can it be used for? You can think about it

945
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,540
Things that can be used in battle are actually disaster prevention

946
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,220
Disaster relief, mountaineering, task force, stuff like that

947
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,660
In fact, they are very similar, the situation is very similar

948
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,460
So actually you can use

949
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,220
then if we are really

950
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
When fighting happens, for example

951
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Here are a few examples. For example, you

952
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
well for example

953
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
where is the supply where is the water

954
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Well, for example, where is the well and where can I get it?

955
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
get something then if you are

956
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
If you walk outside, where is your partner?

957
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
For example, suppose you have

958
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
there is that

959
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Air defense or something

960
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
For example, you are now in disaster

961
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Let's say you have a place where there's a bomb shelter

962
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Or an evacuation facility, but that's not the point

963
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
where is it the point is that it's inside now

964
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Is there anything else?

965
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Is there still room, is there enough water in it?

966
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Is there something so your information

967
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
needs to be updated, then we are

968
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
These things in our current system are very weak

969
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
But it is very easy for you to use this software

970
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That's where this software comes in handy

971
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Then it's written here, since it's combat software

972
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So of course it can happen during combat

973
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,460
great use

974
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,840
For example, it is more useful for our folks to use it.

975
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,960
For example, we just said that the communication software is broken

976
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,160
What to do if LINE is broken

977
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,840
LINE down doesn’t mean your internet is down

978
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,340
Maybe it's just that his server is down

979
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,740
Maybe it's just that LINE was killed

980
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,740
or how

981
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,480
Well, it's software like this

982
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,480
It doesn't matter you just need to connect to the Internet

983
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,980
Even if your network is not connected, it can pass through

984
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,080
Well, you, so if you're in mission command

985
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,180
It's actually very useful

986
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,280
Well, what this page actually tells you is

987
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,340
it has many uses

988
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,340
And now you can start using

989
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,540
The point is how much you you master it

990
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:43,740
Well, I just watched his video

991
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,880
Is there an official video of him

992
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,640
Can you tell me that that can really work?

993
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,740
It's just that he's because sometimes the film shows well

994
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,240
In fact, it can't be used

995
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,040
So the first thing we do is we go and try

996
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,640
We actually installed 40 basemaps

997
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
Make sure its basemap is available

998
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,100
We really did these synergies

999
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,800
know each

1000
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,000
Let's say this example

1001
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,400
I was in Operation Blue Tit at Black Bear Academy

1002
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,300
ok then what

1003
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,200
I'll just take two of us

1004
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,400
Then one of the things that was played in the blue bird operation

1005
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
just anyway

1006
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,600
The People's Liberation Army is arresting people

1007
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,900
we just hide there

1008
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,100
I got caught

1009
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,000
after catch

1010
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,600
I just look at the software

1011
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,000
so i can know where my friends are

1012
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,700
so you know instantly where the other is

1013
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,500
It actually matters when something actually happens

1014
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,700
those streams

1015
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,000
Indeed, this thing can also move

1016
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,100
Hardware and software integration

1017
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,700
After we get acquainted with this

1018
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:41,000
I know how to integrate

1019
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,800
This page is actually very important

1020
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,000
that's it

1021
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,700
it actually

1022
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,700
For example, you have a software like this

1023
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,300
It says this is a tank

1024
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,200
Then it says red is the enemy

1025
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,800
green may be allies

1026
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,600
then this tank

1027
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,700
But the problem is you only look at tanks

1028
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,500
It this for example this tank is

1029
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
which type

1030
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,000
that is

1031
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,840
It means that the icon you think is the same as the icon that others think

1032
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,460
See you both have to recognize the same thing

1033
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:11,460
No, he thinks the green is the friendly army, you think the green is the enemy, so what to do?

1034
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:17,060
So the standard for the entire interface the standard for the entire format

1035
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,860
It's actually a very important thing

1036
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,820
That's why it's important that he meets U.S. military standards

1037
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,160
I mean, any of you so-called, let's say, military-like people

1038
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,160
He sees this interface, he understands it at a glance

1039
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,520
He won't need retraining and it's all the same

1040
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Have relevant training

1041
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,920
This is just watched

1042
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,360
This is something really cool that we will find if we do GIS

1043
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,020
That is, since he can be here, like saying you are in the mountains

1044
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,220
You can know that we are in the mountains, you can't see behind the mountains

1045
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,920
But how do you know that place you can see it or not

1046
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,720
He's here, this place, where he stands in the middle

1047
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,420
Green is what he can see, red is what he can't see

1048
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,920
may be blocked by mountains

1049
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,720
This is very useful when you are fighting, right?

1050
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,780
You can hit you, you can't hit you

1051
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You have to see if you can hit or not

1052
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,500
these are useful

1053
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Then this is task cutting

1054
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,000
I just saw this on video

1055
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,500
I'm just going to say a little more here

1056
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
For example, this one on the right

1057
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
The one on the right is actually what it can be

1058
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
It means that you only need to connect in

1059
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,000
you can message someone

1060
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,500
So a group of people can communicate with each other

1061
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,000
It actually doesn't need a line or anything

1062
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,500
You just add it and you can basically do a group chat

1063
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,500
What I saw just now were all other people's videos

1064
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,500
cutout of

1065
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,000
Now let's show you an example of our own use

1066
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,500
what is this example

1067
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,000
This example is that I took it and I went to Hualien to play

1068
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,500
It's not playing anymore

1069
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
just go to a meeting

1070
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
When I go to a meeting, I will

1071
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,000
Let's have a meeting. It's always delicious food in Hualien.

1072
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,500
I'll just go eat and take a picture of it

1073
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
What you can see is here

1074
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Never mind

1075
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,500
You can see there is a ghost machine here, there are a lot of pictures

1076
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,000
Then the photos will be on the table

1077
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,500
will show up showing it's a photo

1078
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
show its name

1079
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And more importantly, and you see this

1080
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,440
This so-called trajectory can be replayed

1081
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,960
means you can

1082
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,200
you can

1083
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,040
Afterwards, you can know where you are at what time

1084
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,040
Where was the upper echelon at that time

1085
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,840
all this is known

1086
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,240
More importantly, these whole packages

1087
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,840
it can be copied

1088
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,240
I'll go to Hualien Wan to record this

1089
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,840
Then what

1090
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,880
when it's over i just push a button

1091
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,880
Pack

1092
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,920
I'm just a bag

1093
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,920
Then I can pass this packet on to others

1094
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,120
so think about it

1095
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,520
Let's say we go do some scouting

1096
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,040
or do something

1097
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,880
what you've done

1098
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,920
how do you give the information to others

1099
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,240
No, or a group of people working together

1100
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,040
Suppose you collaborate to explore a thing

1101
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,680
Or let's say you cooperate to do an inventory

1102
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,320
where is it near here

1103
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,720
So your mask map is ready

1104
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,360
Of course the masks were made very well.

1105
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,440
But the problem is when you don't have a mask system

1106
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,040
what are you going to do

1107
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,760
It's very simple to use this thing

1108
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,640
You just

1109
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,000
Everyone has a machine like this

1110
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,080
Then everyone's eyes should feel

1111
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Let's say I'm in charge of taking inventory of this area.

1112
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You are in charge of taking stock of that area

1113
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Hit everyone when they go

1114
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
After I clicked, I took stock of the information

1115
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I will pass it on to you

1116
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
and then both to the same person

1117
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
The same person has the right to merge the version

1118
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So that's where he's pretty good

1119
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
There is a picture in the middle

1120
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Then this is like this picture

1121
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
he has many maps

1122
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
For example, when climbing mountains, I like to use Lu map.

1123
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Then, for example, some folks are

1124
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
For example, if you want to see the river, you have to look at the government

1125
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
this kind of map

1126
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Then Google is everyone's favorite

1127
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Sometimes you want to watch satellites

1128
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Sometimes you want to look at drawings

1129
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
so many maps

1130
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
He actually needs to be easily switched

1131
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Then he can switch this thing at any time.

1132
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
import at any time

1133
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
the one on the upper right

1134
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
This one in the upper right corner actually says

1135
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
He is the so-called packing

1136
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That is, you can combine a lot of information into one package

1137
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Just connect and download, after downloading, you will have all the information

1138
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
What's in this bag depends on what you packed in the first place.

1139
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
For example, you can let me give an example

1140
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Okay, here it is, right down the middle, it's the Water Resources Department.

1141
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
This is, for example, the data of the guards.

1142
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
This is open data, so we import the open data directly.

1143
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Others don’t have to do anything to get open information and get things

1144
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
No, he just keeps coming in and opening it

1145
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
There are guards all over his map

1146
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Let's say you think of it as, suppose you're all right now

1147
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
You have a supply point, all kinds of supply points

1148
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Now you probably have any supplies in there, you make it into a bag

1149
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
As soon as the person enters the house, as soon as he opens it, there will be

1150
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Where is he nearby? He is clear.

1151
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
that's where oral

1152
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
OK, let me tell you what we can do.

1153
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
First let me tell you who we are

1154
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Actually we are just us we play these things

1155
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,960
Basically just a few people, a few engineers

1156
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,860
Some do system management, some do software development, some do hardware design

1157
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,060
Experts with drones

1158
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:11,020
Then our spirit is open source

1159
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,520
So you can see that the slideshow just now is open

1160
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,900
The links that you click on in the slideshow, everything is open.

1161
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,000
All that we learn is open

1162
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
what were we doing a while ago

1163
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
We call it free health account stacking

1164
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
For example, you are now listening to my talk about playing this thing

1165
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,960
It feels good

1166
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Is it easy to use?

1167
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,960
Although it is enough to install it, will you use it after installing it?

1168
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,960
In fact, when we played with this thing at the beginning, I found that

1169
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,960
Actually it's not that easy

1170
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,960
it's a bit of a barrier to entry

1171
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,960
Mainly because I don't know why

1172
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,960
It's military software after all it's not enough

1173
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,960
It's well designed, but it's not clear enough

1174
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,960
it won't shoot you a youtube video saying

1175
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,960
you just play like this

1176
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,960
Or you are hard to help with the manual

1177
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
dozens of pages like this

1178
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,960
you just think it's

1179
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,960
why 20 minutes

1180
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
how to get it fast

1181
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,760
Well, to put it simply

1182
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,760
Wired sparring We probably each

1183
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,480
every two to three weeks or a month

1184
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,340
There's going to be an online duel so you can connect.

1185
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,640
Then you don't need to know anything, just take your

1186
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,120
Enjoy the mobile phone to come in and it will be two hours

1187
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,620
online you are in your own home within two hours

1188
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,880
You promise to use it, that is, you will use the important things

1189
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,880
We have such online sparring, I won’t talk about the others

1190
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,880
These are things that we've already done

1191
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,880
We do this online sparring, and it's very touching to say that

1192
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,880
We later had feedback that some police

1193
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,880
some policemen in their own

1194
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
I started using something like this in my work

1195
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,880
I said, how do you know this place? He said that it was you who held the online sparring.

1196
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,880
After they come in, they find it useful after they're done.

1197
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,880
I'll do it myself later, and then I'll do it

1198
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,880
So it's actually doable, it's proven to be doable

1199
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,880
What does this have to do with digital willfulness? Today is not about digital willfulness.

1200
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,880
In fact, it should be said that the community is very flexible.

1201
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But the community is actually very unstructured.

1202
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,320
And the most important thing is the structure

1203
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,320
Difficult to compose in times of war

1204
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,880
Architectural things take a lot of time to plan

1205
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,520
what to build

1206
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,480
Like the Su Hui diplomacy just now

1207
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,680
what they are doing

1208
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,280
That's the architectural thing

1209
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,400
your structural stuff

1210
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,960
when you established very early

1211
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,520
When something happens, everyone will come

1212
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,960
That's if you don't have this structure

1213
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,280
you panic when it happens

1214
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,640
It's the same with this kind of software

1215
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,880
You usually play and practice

1216
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,120
well that might be used for paintball

1217
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,640
What are you climbing again?

1218
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,920
you preschool entertainment

1219
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,600
but when it actually happens

1220
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,000
This time things are very useful

1221
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,840
let me tell you

1222
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,760
Let's not talk about this on the spot

1223
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,360
because there is no time

1224
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,520
I'll just talk about Uber

1225
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,440
while in ukraine

1226
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,040
that time they had a battle

1227
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,280
Just what, what, shield, Nez, what battle

1228
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,920
Then the black army is very strange

1229
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,920
He suddenly one night at the same time

1230
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,400
Didn't he say that all the tanks were blown up by him?

1231
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,040
I saw it then

1232
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
just a headache

1233
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,680
Because we do information systems

1234
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,180
we know very well

1235
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,680
it's very difficult

1236
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,680
How do you coordinate so much information

1237
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,520
then let all the missiles

1238
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,980
at the same gun at the same time

1239
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,980
hit different tanks

1240
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,320
then they say

1241
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,720
They're called the Uber system

1242
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,820
at that time we

1243
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,620
we thought wow

1244
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,420
it's amazing

1245
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,520
how the hell is this done

1246
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,620
found out later

1247
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,620
After I started to know this software

1248
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,620
Is this piece of cake good?

1249
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:27,620
use this thing

1250
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:29,420
no development at all

1251
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,420
Here's how to do it

1252
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,420
Just say yes, everyone has

1253
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,420
let's say

1254
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,420
we say in the message

1255
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,420
we are at 4 a.m.

1256
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,420
we are going to shoot

1257
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,420
For example, this battlegroup

1258
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,420
4:00 a.m. I'm going to fire

1259
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:40,420
it's 12 o'clock

1260
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,420
Commanders please yourself

1261
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,420
Choose which tank you want to fight

1262
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,420
That drone flew over

1263
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,420
he will find

1264
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,420
he will soar

1265
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,420
Bahia are these tanks here

1266
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,420
Then the commander would say, for example

1267
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,420
everyone chooses

1268
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,420
After the election, someone must reveal it, right?

1269
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,420
So he communicated in the group and said

1270
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:57,420
so you hit him

1271
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,420
he hit him

1272
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,420
Okay, let's talk at 3:00

1273
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,560
Don't move, everyone, start moving at 4 o'clock

1274
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,220
4 o'clock, one hit is not all dead

1275
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,920
It's that simple

1276
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,500
no customization, no need for anything

1277
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,680
The things just mentioned are all built-in in the AT software.

1278
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,780
All do not need F, this is strong software and weak software

1279
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,640
You just saw this and you knew it

1280
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,800
If you are fighting, you are

1281
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,520
On the other side of Russia, you are

1282
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,840
You are on the Russian side, you don't have this thing

1283
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,900
Or do you wish you were Ukraine with this thing

1284
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,480
I don't want to be the one I don't have, I feel beaten to death

1285
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,800
This is, and most importantly, this is open

1286
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,100
That

1287
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,740
This is the basic reference

1288
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:43,400
Anyway, this is pretty useful, but

1289
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,120
I've always found it weird to promote this thing

1290
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,340
he is open

1291
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,160
no money

1292
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:52,600
Then I don't know why everyone doesn't know

1293
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,440
Then when I started learning this, I wanted to say I don't know

1294
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,340
It is because this one is very new, too new, so people don't know

1295
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,240
no i touched his

1296
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,760
He has been out for two or three years

1297
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,160
And what's more, I have been promoting him for more than half a year

1298
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,800
In fact, I guess almost no one knows now.

1299
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,320
i feel weird

1300
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,020
Anyway, the most important thing is

1301
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,980
The application promotion at the top is the first link at the beginning

1302
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,080
And the last practice guide is basically

1303
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,460
when we practiced online

1304
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,300
Record

1305
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,120
Then if you say I can't wait for your online sparring

1306
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,100
You click on the link below

1307
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,660
In fact, if you follow that, you can already do it.

1308
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,300
Actually, you don't even need to come in to practice.

1309
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,260
that's it

1310
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,660
ok 20 minutes yes yes yes

1311
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,800
thanks to his dad for sharing i think this

1312
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,200
I just had this and secretly pressed download

1313
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,700
Sure enough, as you said, someone needs to be brought in the door

1314
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,100
Anyway, wait a minute after our event

1315
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,220
maybe a few minutes for us to be there

1316
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
This more people know this software

1317
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
But I think this thing is

1318
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Although we don't want

1319
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
we actually use it in wartime

1320
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
because we don't want war

1321
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
But actually the other way around

1322
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Maybe the more people we had before the war even happened

1323
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
get ready for war

1324
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
War is less likely

1325
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
why? because you raised the enemy

1326
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
to attack your cost

1327
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
when he finds out

1328
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Whoever I'm going to attack is ready

1329
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
When my chances of success are low

1330
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Otherwise, there will be no war

1331
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So I think it's a

1332
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
why are we here now

1333
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Another reason

1334
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Then I think the one just before

1335
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
whether habba

1336
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Or we've had the holidays above and it's all good

1337
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
peacetime conversion

1338
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
In fact, many things we usually

1339
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
We may all use things on a daily basis

1340
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Maybe we didn't necessarily think to say

1341
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It turns out that this thing was during the war

1342
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
or in possibly gray

1343
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
When faced with the gray dangerous hybrid battle

1344
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
can come in handy

1345
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So I think this is what we are looking forward to today

1346
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Share with you the next details

1347
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Because like Qsearch

1348
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Meaning we are now very much

1349
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
The industry is

1350
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
A community monitoring that will be used

1351
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Or a tool to understand the voice of the community

1352
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Then if there is a war

1353
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
A monitoring tool for a community like this

1354
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
what kind of role can we play

1355
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
I think this is worth listening to

1356
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Then let's welcome Director Cai first, thank you

1357
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
will there be a picture here

1358
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
good

1359
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Hello everyone

1360
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Hello friends online

1361
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
yes it is

1362
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Like this one just lying on the tide

1363
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
In fact, we are the Cunzuo introduced by the chief operating officer Hong.

1364
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Monitoring of online information

1365
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
That is of course based on public information.

1366
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Either that or I can already

1367
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Intrude into the conversation group that may be LINE

1368
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Actually, I'm still in the commercial field

1369
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
There will be some customers who have this kind of demand

1370
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
then i will call

1371
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,600
just tell them

1372
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,680
Maybe join the official organization on the other side

1373
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,600
You will have this opportunity to enjoy this right like this

1374
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,400
Yes, but we still don't have this thing in Taiwan

1375
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,240
So we're collecting a lot of publicly available information

1376
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,760
That's actually because now

1377
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,360
I believe everyone feels the information explosion

1378
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,000
Especially in recent times, there are too many

1379
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,840
Various information about a series of societies

1380
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,360
it just keeps happening

1381
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,120
And so actually some people

1382
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,560
That's when the information can be too explosive

1383
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,160
he is easily distracted or frustrated

1384
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,800
Or it's just that he can't absorb it like this

1385
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,840
That's too far

1386
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,920
Let's go back to today's topic

1387
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,600
Then introduce our company first

1388
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,760
That is to say, when it comes to cognitive operations,

1389
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,560
In fact, the election campaign is also a cognitive war

1390
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,160
Then we are indeed the space-time background of software development

1391
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,200
It happened to be 2014

1392
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,080
that year

1393
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,640
It's the mayoral race

1394
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,320
That's a motley crew

1395
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,960
A motley crew with a consensus

1396
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,280
That's against another candidate Lian Shengwen like this

1397
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,120
In that year, I thought I should remind everyone of the background of time and space.

1398
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:20,000
In fact, Facebook did not have a large number of commercial advertisements in that year.

1399
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,200
Even many brands have not yet established a fan industry

1400
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:22,880
what is the reason

1401
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,880
They were still stealing vegetables back then.

1402
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,240
or the end of the restaurant

1403
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,360
Everyone is still playing online games

1404
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,120
yes but it is

1405
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,920
just because you know

1406
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,880
Candidate Ke Wenzhe did not have so many resources at that time

1407
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,320
He may have political ideas or something

1408
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,240
Then he will call a group of people

1409
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:45,800
Then these people started using the Internet

1410
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,800
Platforms like this are starting to advocate

1411
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,240
then go tell everyone

1412
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,720
then this is one such candidate

1413
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:55,560
what is the ideal of this candidate

1414
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,160
So what are his expectations for the municipality?

1415
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,920
or what will he do in the future

1416
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,460
Then you see he is doing cognitive warfare

1417
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,200
He's just telling everyone

1418
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,800
then why do you support me

1419
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,400
So in fact, the market share of the campaign brand

1420
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,860
He is cognitive warfare

1421
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,100
Of course there are some confrontations between countries

1422
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,860
He is also a cognitive operator

1423
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,060
It just means that we usually compare

1424
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,600
I think this distance is far

1425
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,900
Or rather don't know how to deal with

1426
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,700
so maybe on this

1427
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,060
I think the better way

1428
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,560
It's our open discussion

1429
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,260
Then see how

1430
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:32,960
Can go for drills and upgrades

1431
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,960
optimize your awareness

1432
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,200
ok that pair

1433
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,200
just to introduce

1434
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,040
We started in 2014

1435
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,440
collect this information

1436
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,560
There was Facebook in the beginning

1437
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:45,400
That's quite a lot now

1438
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,100
Actually we're not just political type clients

1439
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:49,540
Mainly commercial customers

1440
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,700
the needs of commercial customers

1441
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:53,560
Still contains quite a lot of other media

1442
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,760
For example, in recent years, IG YouTube

1443
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,200
In fact, more and more users like this

1444
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,100
that or

1445
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,560
online forums

1446
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,560
Things like PTD cards

1447
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,440
There is still a need for business intelligence gathering

1448
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,000
So we just collected more and more complete data

1449
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,400
Of course we also collected some

1450
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,440
Transnational facebook information

1451
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,880
just indeed

1452
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:16,200
Operate as a commercial company

1453
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,280
It does require some user use

1454
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,640
So we're balancing this thing

1455
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:22,600
good

1456
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,120
That's exactly what it's doing

1457
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,360
Develop Parchong software

1458
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,440
then collect data

1459
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,880
Then build a visual interface

1460
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,280
I'm sure you're all using Google

1461
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,600
So what Google gives you is its guess

1462
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,640
You may be interested in these pages

1463
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,840
do you charge a key

1464
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,240
You may be interested in these pages

1465
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,560
There is a need, and what I want to know

1466
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,480
so it recommends

1467
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,520
EatLocku webpage for you

1468
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,400
then our side

1469
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,640
Even Google it does something like

1470
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,240
how to say

1471
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,360
It guesses you might take the A word

1472
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,600
But it speculates that the B word is also related to the A word

1473
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,240
So it might put the word B in some pages that contain

1474
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,840
push you like this

1475
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,400
Our main service here is organizations or brands, which are related to business

1476
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,680
Or maybe the operator of the cognitive warfare just mentioned

1477
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,360
in this way

1478
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,880
That means they may need more precise information

1479
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,120
For example, today I may be President Tsai Ing-wen

1480
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,480
then he has many aliases

1481
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,040
Then I will call up one by one

1482
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:25,320
Then go collect these posts that contain these keywords

1483
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,360
I can't use a blur to show the user something like this

1484
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:32,320
So we actually developed a visual interface

1485
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,560
Then the difference between him and Google is that

1486
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:35,960
he is pictorial

1487
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:39,120
He can tell you some comparisons

1488
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,080
So what are some of the more influential posts?

1489
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,680
Then I will show you some pictures later

1490
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,840
Of course, it is for the fact that I just came here before

1491
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,320
I was listening to another professor's speech

1492
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,160
He is a professor at National Taiwan University

1493
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,880
Then he said that AI is very popular now

1494
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,000
Then AI is actually like our children

1495
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,200
Maybe when I was studying

1496
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,100
Do you need to turn the pages to look up the dictionary?

1497
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,000
then progress to

1498
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,500
Hey, maybe an invincible translator

1499
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,100
From now on, mobile phone can check anytime

1500
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,400
In fact, information is now very easy to obtain.

1501
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,500
Rather, it is whether everyone's analytical ability has kept up

1502
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,300
that or

1503
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,500
Hey, in fact, some AI is being trained now

1504
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:20,100
it can be

1505
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,700
put some mature analysis

1506
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:26,500
logical or path can turn it into a

1507
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,200
Common people can also use it like this

1508
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,100
is that it may use a simple interface for everyone to use

1509
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,500
that's just saying in

1510
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,300
Well

1511
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,100
The so-called cognitive warfare

1512
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,300
In fact, it is still difficult

1513
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,600
just have one

1514
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,900
Relatively fixed analysis logic

1515
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,100
because sometimes

1516
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,300
Uh, the speaker or the party who tried out the message

1517
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,500
what is its position

1518
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,000
it may be a variable

1519
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,700
Then it can be done in a very diverse way

1520
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,300
So in fact, we address some needs of customers

1521
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,600
for example maybe in

1522
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,300
An analysis of an issue, or a

1523
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,100
uh yes

1524
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,400
Some analysis of business needs

1525
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,400
We are still relatively high in human intervention

1526
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,900
So we also provide a consultant service like this

1527
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:12,400
To help customers do some data induction and analysis

1528
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,900
Our interface just mentioned is like this

1529
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:20,700
The one on the left is an interface gradually entered from 2014 to now

1530
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,800
It's a search engine like Google

1531
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,900
It's just that the information we searched was all social media forums.

1532
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,400
Or information such as electronic media

1533
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,200
then we just visualize it

1534
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,000
For example, now there is volume

1535
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,800
What does the volume mean?

1536
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:39,400
Because before the community came out, the definition of volume was the volume of articles

1537
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,600
But now the definition of volume should be the volume of attention

1538
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,900
That is, how many people interacted with this Facebook post

1539
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,400
Indicates how much attention this person has paid to this post

1540
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,900
In the past, electronic media or paper media

1541
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,600
In fact, it is difficult for you to know that you may look at the circulation

1542
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,100
You may see that it is online media, it may have public

1543
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
what pageviews

1544
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,160
But have these pageviews been verified

1545
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,360
don't know

1546
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,160
So in fact, it will be difficult for you to know the influence of a content

1547
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,560
But social media is relatively organic.

1548
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,560
That is to say, this post is like refueling, I just said it

1549
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,400
just maybe a ukrainian

1550
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,960
just shared a post about him in Ukraine

1551
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,160
How many people follow

1552
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,360
We can learn from those numbers organically

1553
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,360
How many people are paying attention to this matter

1554
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,200
Yes, so we are presenting in this way

1555
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,200
Oh that issue

1556
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,200
It appears in which pipelines have this topic mentioned

1557
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Then how many people interacted with the posts mentioning this issue in these channels

1558
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,200
We visualize it like this

1559
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,200
Okay, so here's how we organize our information

1560
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,200
that's really in business

1561
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,200
Will also do some combat dashboards

1562
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
because maybe it is

1563
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Whether it is a commercial brand

1564
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,200
or say a candidate

1565
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,200
it also says the same

1566
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,200
Hey, I'm in every channel

1567
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,200
How many people interacted with

1568
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,200
It is presented with a combat dashboard

1569
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,200
That way it will be quick

1570
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,640
I know what state I'm in now

1571
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,240
Then which direction should I work hard

1572
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,160
Or who is kinder to me

1573
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,360
Who is less friendly to me

1574
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:07,800
I can use this way

1575
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,040
comparison at a glance

1576
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,960
Then of course we also take these things apart

1577
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:15,360
That is, it can also be combined with different

1578
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,880
in internal system

1579
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,640
Then or directly use the API to connect with others

1580
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,760
Okay, that's about the end of my company introduction.

1581
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,840
I'm just more relevant today

1582
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,960
still continue

1583
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,040
Anyway, everyone may understand the election campaign better.

1584
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:27,760
so leave

1585
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,120
so many legislators

1586
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,880
In fact, there are many legislators

1587
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,480
that everyone uses social media

1588
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,440
In fact, now using the political capacity of social media

1589
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,320
Very almost like maybe 90% 100%

1590
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,760
Then they actually sent a lot of questions.

1591
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,640
But you and I believe not everyone

1592
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,960
Every article is tracked

1593
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,560
Yes, these legislators are dealing with

1594
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,520
Everyone is digesting everyone's tax budget

1595
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,440
Then go to deal with the affairs of the country

1596
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,520
yeah that's just saying

1597
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,160
time you might normally live

1598
01:10:59,160 --> 01:10:59,880
you will not

1599
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,520
uh spent so much time chasing down say

1600
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,920
Hey, are these people doing something good?

1601
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,480
That may be what everyone expected in the past to say

1602
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,000
We use uh some citizen media to track these people

1603
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Are you doing well?

1604
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,720
But now it's true that citizen media himself demands survival

1605
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,400
That is to say, he also wants to have a commercial hidden pregnancy.

1606
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,760
So I, I would think that actually after social media came out,

1607
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,720
Uh, the media industry has changed from being very centralized to a very decentralized structure

1608
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,960
That's why we're here today to discuss this

1609
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,160
The problem is that in the past, the ability of the media to try may not have been that important

1610
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,480
Because you can't change the structure of that media

1611
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,840
But now the power of the media is important because now who

1612
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:43,880
Once a message comes out, everyone may go crazy or something.

1613
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,720
then you need to understand

1614
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,640
Hey, what is the purpose of this message?

1615
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,560
how could he affect me like this

1616
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,360
Yes, the words here mean uh

1617
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,480
you read so much information

1618
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,520
Then who will subtract and sum the information?

1619
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,400
Then what impact does he have on society?

1620
01:11:59,400 --> 01:11:59,960
certainly

1621
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,120
As the previous two mentioned, it means different roles

1622
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,040
We can play our respective positions in this social structure

1623
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,960
and do these things well

1624
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,000
For example, there are indeed some

1625
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,720
We regularly collate this information

1626
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,040
and make it available to everyone

1627
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,560
Or make some observations about possible legislators

1628
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,120
Then what about these legislators?

1629
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,720
This topic will be mentioned differently

1630
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,360
Which issues are actually getting more attention from the public?

1631
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,280
Then we are through the classification and labeling of these posts

1632
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:36,080
and then take the influence of these so-called post interactions

1633
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,560
do a calculation

1634
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,800
After that, it ran out of a chart like this

1635
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:41,880
Let everyone go for reference

1636
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:48,080
Of course, part of the legislator's purpose is to meet some expectations of the voters.

1637
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,680
Then of course he has to meet the party's expectations.

1638
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,280
Or maybe it's on his own personal will

1639
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,840
to do a balance like this

1640
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,680
So we can go this way

1641
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,040
Assist in calibration

1642
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,460
Some expectations that people have about potentially different objects

1643
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:06,800
and then go so that they can optimize themselves like this

1644
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,400
yes that looks like you

1645
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,800
Issues of particular concern to the opposition and ruling parties

1646
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,600
The issues he used to fight may be different

1647
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,700
or his voters

1648
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,200
his district voters

1649
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,000
In other words, the degree of attention of his supporters is not the same.

1650
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,400
That's how we grab these articles

1651
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,100
Then there are a lot of them, maybe tens of thousands

1652
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:31,400
Then we classify it

1653
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,900
It should be tens of thousands

1654
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:35,000
So sort it and go tag it

1655
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,900
Then make an analysis chart of influence like this, and it will look like this

1656
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,700
Yes, of course would want to automate this

1657
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,800
So we also have in the test say

1658
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,400
Can AI speed up this process?

1659
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,400
less involvement

1660
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,500
Because we are constructing an analysis logic

1661
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:54,500
That allows everyone to supervise faster and more efficiently

1662
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:57,800
These are the people who are chosen

1663
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,000
ok that pair

1664
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,760
These are some of the presentations we made with the data we crawled

1665
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,260
Then everyone can see that

1666
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,460
That's actually quite interesting.

1667
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,860
for some reason he happens a lot

1668
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,900
But his influence may not be that great relatively

1669
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:17,260
probably based on charisma based on the issues he speaks about

1670
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:21,460
Based on the trust he may have built up with voters in the past or something

1671
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,060
will affect the results of these things

1672
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:25,500
He will keep changing dynamically like this

1673
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,900
Yes, so it is true that the information tube is very explosive when there is a lot of information.

1674
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,060
Then we need to have some effective way to organize

1675
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:35,900
Well, it just so happened that a lot of things like this happened this year.

1676
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,860
Then we have also made some comparative issues for the release of these contents

1677
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:40,640
that is to say

1678
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,900
How about the traffic problem on the Internet?

1679
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,900
Then how do you pay attention

1680
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,900
Did the level of everyone's attention follow the occurrence of some events?

1681
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,040
while rising

1682
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,600
Or maybe there are some sub-topics under this big topic

1683
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,060
What are you discussing about those sub-topics?

1684
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,960
What kind of words are mentioned like this

1685
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,900
Then sort it out in this way so that everyone can understand it better.

1686
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,400
Because I believe that when you're dealing with very large

1687
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,900
For example, you may give up reading 10,000 articles

1688
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:13,100
But these 10,000 articles seem to be sorted out for you

1689
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,900
You'll feel like I'm coming to see it like this

1690
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:17,100
That threshold will be much different

1691
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,700
that's what we're doing

1692
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:20,700
for citizens like this

1693
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:24,700
Or maybe some of the media's docking objects like this

1694
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,100
Then you should pile on this cognitive warfare

1695
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,000
It's just that I just mentioned a little earlier

1696
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,700
That is, we are faced with a large amount of information

1697
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:34,700
We do some tidying up

1698
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,400
That part of course tries to automate

1699
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,000
Part of it is still human-involved, and the part looks like this

1700
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,900
then in this state

1701
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,000
In fact, it also requires the cooperation of many different units of objects

1702
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,600
that for the government

1703
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,000
Because in fact, this kind of social platform in Taiwan

1704
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,600
mostly foreign

1705
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,100
Then I think there are quite a few incidents

1706
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:55,600
it happens all the time

1707
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,800
For example, did you see someone impersonate?

1708
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:58,800
just a lot

1709
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,460
I show up right after something happens

1710
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:04,460
Scam syndicates are doing penis comparisons

1711
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,460
Immediately there is an impostor etc.

1712
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:08,460
Then he said hey, you can join my LINE group

1713
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,460
It's like the stocks are fat and high.

1714
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:11,960
yes so actually

1715
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,960
I think the government is on top of this

1716
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,960
Need to pay attention to these social platforms

1717
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,960
How to raise possibly some malicious messages

1718
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:21,960
The operating threshold looks like this

1719
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,960
For example, how about

1720
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,960
Distinguish, compete for position, these things

1721
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,960
They need to actively discuss with the platform

1722
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,960
and that is

1723
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,960
Target some influential KOLs

1724
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,960
or influencer

1725
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,960
In fact, he may have been in these people in the past

1726
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,960
The framework of traditional media to operate

1727
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,960
That may be relatively manageable in

1728
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,960
to a certain extent it won't be

1729
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,960
speak indiscriminately or speak indiscriminately quickly

1730
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:49,960
can be controlled

1731
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:52,960
But now because of the platform, everyone can use it freely

1732
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,960
then i feel like saying

1733
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,960
he's like what we usually do

1734
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,960
Disaster drills are the same

1735
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,640
These guys have to be more interesting

1736
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,440
Because he's a man of influence

1737
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,940
He must be more interesting to know that he is in this society

1738
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:08,940
What is the role of delivering information

1739
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:12,100
Then he has to be more interesting to prevent some

1740
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:15,040
The spread of wrong or malicious information

1741
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:17,940
Yes, then I think this is where the government can go

1742
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,280
plan some resources and then

1743
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,580
Identify influencers on the platform

1744
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,580
and then encourage them to participate in something like this

1745
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,380
workshop or walkthrough like this

1746
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,240
Make them more media literate

1747
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,040
Because in fact, for such an influential person

1748
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,280
Sure wish he was more media literate.

1749
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,280
Otherwise they do whatever they want

1750
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,740
Then the general public will accept it

1751
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,280
Because the content is actually created by a small number of people

1752
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,780
that most of the people are the ones who receive the content

1753
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,080
Then for these more influential nodes

1754
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,080
Of course there are more things to do

1755
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,680
Then again, it is true that the government regularly visits

1756
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,480
Minus and these influential people

1757
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,180
and then go to the list

1758
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:58,380
Then also subtract and say they used to pass the comparison

1759
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,420
The status of the message in question

1760
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,920
what is the extent of the situation

1761
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,400
Of course we can construct this logic

1762
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,400
Then do a certain degree of regulation

1763
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,100
I'm not here to talk about regulation

1764
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,460
Not to stop everyone or say

1765
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,060
Control people not to speak freely

1766
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,960
but that you remind him

1767
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,060
something is wrong

1768
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,900
then you may want to train him

1769
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,320
to correct or say

1770
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,260
train him

1771
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:22,260
probably try not to have something like this happen

1772
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,400
the media and influencers

1773
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,820
Indeed, he just became

1774
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,820
Create some messages and produce and disseminate

1775
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:31,480
check mechanism

1776
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,280
Right now there are a lot of PR crises like now

1777
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:38,280
it happened to some famous people

1778
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,480
Then why is this situation?

1779
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,780
Because in the past they faced traditional media

1780
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,780
That node is relatively simple

1781
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,980
but now you are

1782
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:47,220
After posting a lot of things online

1783
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,480
I can't get it back

1784
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,340
Then he started spreading out

1785
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,220
So actually a lot of people are on it

1786
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:53,280
unconscious

1787
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,380
He will feel that I can say whatever I want to say

1788
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,940
Is it a free society?

1789
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,380
Then he didn't expect to say

1790
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,100
because it was caused after he sent it out

1791
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,640
how big is this

1792
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,740
So it's actually suspicious.

1793
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,500
that is

1794
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:05,940
people in the media industry or

1795
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,240
he is influential

1796
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:08,900
he has to be more conscious

1797
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,840
Facing the matter of being influential

1798
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,940
Then he needs to know more about his message

1799
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,400
some checks and controls

1800
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,440
What is the mechanism of self-correction?

1801
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,640
For some dissemination of news from time to time

1802
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,140
how to face

1803
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,500
Well, he actually has a little

1804
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,900
Public relations image training?

1805
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,540
Then establish some cooperation mechanism with the government platform

1806
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:32,300
Because in fact these large nodes

1807
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:36,200
It is also easy to receive messages from various parties

1808
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:37,800
Do you want to report these messages?

1809
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,040
Or should we assist in joint governance?

1810
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,540
Maybe something is wrong on the platform

1811
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,600
to co-govern or something

1812
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,040
I think this can be actively discussed like this

1813
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,040
What about the general public?

1814
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,940
Of course, there are not many tools available.

1815
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,540
Because in fact these platforms

1816
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,340
Of course he's in free mode

1817
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:56,700
That is to use everyone to make money.

1818
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,000
So in fact, I think the general public

1819
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
to face is

1820
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,500
How to develop the ability to try

1821
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,500
Then I divide it into two categories

1822
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,700
Divided into two categories

1823
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,700
Some of them are practitioners like us or

1824
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,300
Familiar with numbers

1825
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:13,400
He has digital ability and digital sensitivity.

1826
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,800
What about this kind of person?

1827
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,400
is relatively speaking

1828
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,800
Doesn't need a lot of training

1829
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,500
But actually we

1830
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:23,000
That is, the population structure has become an inverted triangle

1831
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I think the statistical results

1832
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,400
In fact, most elders are relatively

1833
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,100
Those who are not familiar with these digital environments

1834
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,500
Yes, I didn't want

1835
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,500
means discrimination

1836
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,100
But this is the result of statistics

1837
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,200
is that you can see that it is

1838
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,900
If you continue to report a lot, you will be deceived like this.

1839
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:44,900
In fact, I think it has something to do with finances and some personal perceptions.

1840
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,900
So actually I would say

1841
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,800
Do your parents take care of themselves?

1842
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,600
Or maybe my relatives and friends take care of themselves

1843
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:51,500
that or

1844
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:55,100
Maybe the government or related units can use these resources

1845
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,100
Education that popularizes these digital literacy

1846
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,500
help everyone to identify

1847
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,000
that this

1848
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,160
Background tea box for some influential objects

1849
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,000
that is

1850
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,160
then a message today

1851
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,360
Then you can first see who the speaker is

1852
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,560
is he an imposter

1853
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,560
Or what purpose does he have?

1854
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:11,960
What

1855
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,760
just make it a habit

1856
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,400
I give an example

1857
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,960
In fact, like in the past, Facebook targeted every fan industry

1858
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,360
he didn't offer

1859
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,560
so-called transparency

1860
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:23,520
information field like this

1861
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,800
But after some election turmoil

1862
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,120
Has the fan industry changed its name?

1863
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:32,680
Which area is his manager from?

1864
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,280
can be directly compared to transparent

1865
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,240
then i think

1866
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,360
But what he did

1867
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:38,920
Not everyone has this habit

1868
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,680
to check this thing

1869
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,280
So many people still see

1870
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,240
this person posted

1871
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,120
heard of this person

1872
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:45,560
I believe what he wrote

1873
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,920
it will still happen

1874
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:49,120
That's people with poor digital sensitivity.

1875
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:49,880
that kind of person

1876
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,360
We can only remind him

1877
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:55,080
Train him to raise awareness like this

1878
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,480
Then I think this is something the general public can do.

1879
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,680
He has less tools

1880
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,040
because

1881
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,300
The analysis tool department also has to learn the threshold like this

1882
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,000
right good

1883
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,500
In the past, the role of the media was indeed

1884
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,700
Maybe help with vacation?

1885
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,900
That is they have something like this reporter

1886
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,200
He just went to see how to spread some malicious messages.

1887
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,200
And what is his impact on society?

1888
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,600
then what are those sources

1889
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,300
That is indeed a comparison

1890
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:24,800
The so-called intelligence officer looks at the dissemination of these messages from a more overlooked perspective.

1891
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,000
but you as a facebook user

1892
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,300
You just take the message and you believe it

1893
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,600
that for this kind of person

1894
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,800
What about this kind of people?

1895
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,500
People with low digital sensitivity

1896
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,100
Of course we can only remind him and train him.

1897
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:39,300
like me may be more mandatory

1898
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,400
It is possible that my mother passed on some

1899
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,200
I think it's the source of the content farm

1900
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:47,900
I just help him block these sources on facebook regularly

1901
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,600
It's more mandatory to do this.

1902
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,900
Because it costs you too much to train him

1903
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,300
You might as well just help him deal with it like this

1904
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,600
Of course, this is how it can cover some

1905
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,000
Possibly not a very good quality message

1906
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
in this way

1907
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
that or

1908
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
You see my friend did encounter this time

1909
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
chaotic

1910
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
that is there is a wrong message

1911
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
stuffed into one

1912
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
the mouth of the most recent topic

1913
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
The person in question didn't say anything about it.

1914
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
But the victim

1915
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
It may be thought by some netizens that

1916
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Are you lying to me?

1917
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Are you really busy?

1918
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
That's true being an influencer

1919
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It should be my second point

1920
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
That is to say, he can only quickly clarify

1921
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
and use some good

1922
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Compared with the low-threshold method

1923
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Let everyone quickly understand

1924
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Then why am I not what you say

1925
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
or as you know

1926
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
then i think it's a celebrity

1927
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
or influential nodes

1928
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
some training like this

1929
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Then or you look at ancient times

1930
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
also in this wave

1931
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Let everyone pay attention to this matter

1932
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Said that Facebook in Taiwan is in charge of advertising

1933
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
But

1934
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,600
Why are they still unable to manage efficiently?

1935
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,800
Is there still some room for optimization?

1936
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,960
I think he is proposing this topic

1937
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,840
Make it possible for the government and possibly related units to understand

1938
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,200
is it possible to sit here

1939
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:17,600
raise the bar higher

1940
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,560
Let these scams not be so easy to operate on this

1941
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,840
And then the digital citizen paragon is what I just mentioned

1942
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,800
That is to say, it may be aimed at those with weaker digital skills.

1943
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,720
Of course, there are some open source or relatively low-threshold tools now

1944
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:37,520
A robot like Meiyu Yiya or something real or fake

1945
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:43,720
can help our friends and relatives discern what Bush's news looks like

1946
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,400
Then I think what I just mentioned is to preach to them.

1947
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,480
Are you checking by example?

1948
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,480
what can you see

1949
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,400
Messages like this scam usually mean that the benefits are huge

1950
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,720
Then turn easily

1951
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,760
Then I ask you to join the LINE group that we can't monitor

1952
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,040
what happened there

1953
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,800
you have no way of knowing

1954
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,640
Then maybe these people were all raised and beaten.

1955
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:07,280
Yes, so we actually need to increase our identification.

1956
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,240
how did these behaviors happen

1957
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,640
Then when you encounter what kind of behavioral logic

1958
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,440
you need to be more alert

1959
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,120
Just like when we were young, we were called by our mother

1960
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,840
like seeing a stranger

1961
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:19,240
let's not chat with him casually

1962
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,400
don't just follow him

1963
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,360
is the same reason

1964
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,520
In turn, we need to make these digital capabilities

1965
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,640
Teach weak people how to deal with these things

1966
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,160
except defense

1967
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,960
is our own sense of citizenship

1968
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,400
In other words, the organization's defense is improved.

1969
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,520
Then I think outside

1970
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,360
This is not an attack

1971
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,560
It is to establish friendly units with foreign countries.

1972
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,920
or the whole country

1973
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,520
The whole is a large unit

1974
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,560
unit of the people

1975
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:53,880
How to adjust others externally

1976
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,000
to our other countries

1977
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,760
or how citizens of other countries perceive us

1978
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,000
Of course this thing is a bit PR

1979
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,400
The technique is like Google Trend, it is also a public thing

1980
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,200
It looks like what I'm showing here is the United States searching for the word Taiwan

1981
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,400
Which related searches in the past seven days are linked together

1982
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,700
Surely this is what Google counts?

1983
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:19,000
It seems to be some kind of Blinken here

1984
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
when visiting China

1985
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:27,200
Taiwan is still using the Taiwan Relations Act or something

1986
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:31,200
To do some interaction between countries like this

1987
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,600
Yes, then this thing is cross-body in foreign countries

1988
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,100
Then there is Taiwan #MeToo

1989
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,900
What else is there such a word as autonomy what is related to Blinken

1990
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:43,000
Then I think these words mean that everyone already has search intentions.

1991
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,300
Of course they will have access to a lot of relevant information

1992
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:49,800
that might be on the taiwan side

1993
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:54,000
The unit of the representative's speech may need to regularly check these

1994
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,300
What you may be searching for

1995
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,600
and check out what kind of content they might receive

1996
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,000
then go to balance

1997
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,700
Have we been bullied for our position on this?

1998
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,940
Threatened or what?

1999
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:07,440
As far as our own true thoughts are concerned

2000
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,180
express it like this

2001
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,780
Let everyone search and see like this

2002
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,640
So by creating a link like this

2003
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,380
and then to clarify or say

2004
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:19,080
To dialectize the correctness of some information like this

2005
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,180
ok what else

2006
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:23,280
is that we want to use the characteristic

2007
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,020
Want to make a friendly connection?

2008
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:27,400
Then I think this thing is like

2009
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:28,900
Taiwan RUSH can do this

2010
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:31,600
Because indeed we are doing all kinds of content materials

2011
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,940
Let everyone know Taiwan

2012
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,740
Know what kind of place Taiwan is

2013
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:35,940
Know the characteristics of Taiwan

2014
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:38,200
Know what is the most popular place in Taiwan

2015
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,800
In fact, Taiwan has a lot of hidden champions

2016
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,300
so much light of taiwan

2017
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,140
how do we use these things

2018
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,440
How about connecting with the world?

2019
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,380
I believe refueling is usually

2020
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,240
been working on this thing

2021
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,540
That's actually

2022
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,740
I will give two examples

2023
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,020
One is Gemaran

2024
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:55,020
Is Kavalan the light of Taiwan?

2025
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,320
because in fact

2026
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,720
as long as in the world

2027
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:58,740
man of what may be the world

2028
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,080
almost everyone

2029
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Hey, Gemaran is very ugly, like this

2030
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,240
So actually we can use

2031
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,640
everyone's interest in this

2032
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,700
Let everyone know better

2033
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:07,800
Taiwan is a Prospective Place

2034
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,200
Why is Gemaran's wine so good?

2035
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,200
In fact, I don't think there is any need to ask for an answer.

2036
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,600
everyone we are

2037
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,600
Hey, am I disconnected?

2038
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,600
I encountered a network outage, a power outage

2039
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,900
right

2040
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,100
Yes, that's the same

2041
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,900
That is to say, Gemaran

2042
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:26,600
then we use

2043
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,200
likely average citizen

2044
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,400
He didn't really pay much attention to the war either.

2045
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,400
but ordinary citizens

2046
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,400
Interests and hobbies in Gemaran

2047
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,100
Let them know more about Taiwan

2048
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:38,000
Is this a way to establish a connection?

2049
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:38,900
May be love without disease

2050
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,600
He loves Gemaran and also loves Taiwan

2051
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,500
Well, the other one is what I want to say

2052
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:45,600
Hey, of course Taiwan has another geographical advantage.

2053
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,300
Uh, like I saw a foreigner

2054
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,100
He came to Taiwan to pay taxes

2055
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,000
Then he said why he came to Taiwan to pay taxes

2056
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
It's near Kenting

2057
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,100
Then he said that the coral reefs in Taiwan are real

2058
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,600
Wonders of the world, wonders like this

2059
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,100
is considered

2060
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,100
but well worth it

2061
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:09,300
And then he's in some dive master's book

2062
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,900
when i saw this

2063
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,100
he really every year

2064
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:15,200
I still come to Taiwan to dive once every few years.

2065
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,900
Then it's time to see these Cape Corals in Taiwan

2066
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,300
Then I think that there are actually many such things in Taiwan.

2067
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:24,100
Some features that attract people from all over the world

2068
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,600
then of course we are

2069
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,300
Do these things individually

2070
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,700
For example, the one who loves Malan from Aiwei Vision

2071
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,500
We target these people to tell them what Taiwan is

2072
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,100
and then target these divers

2073
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,900
Tell them what Taiwan is

2074
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,100
Why Taiwan is worthy of your love

2075
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:41,100
So if we say that Taiwan is attacked today

2076
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,500
Then change to another government

2077
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:45,900
Will you not be able to freely come to Taiwan to dive?

2078
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:49,100
even with a little bigger emotional blackmail or something like that

2079
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,700
Of course, this way is to let everyone understand more

2080
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,900
So what kind of existence is Taiwan?

2081
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,000
let them go through

2082
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,700
through content they are interested in

2083
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:00,200
Enter Taiwan this this objection

2084
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Then let them know more about the problems Taiwan is facing now

2085
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Then this question may affect him looking forward to the interests like this

2086
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
We connect with the world monitoring power in this way

2087
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Ok, so this is my sharing today

2088
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,000
that is

2089
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Well

2090
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
is also

2091
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
how to say

2092
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Everyone may be figuring it out too.

2093
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
So let's talk about it together

2094
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
right

2095
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
This director Cai shares with you

2096
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Then shall we directly invite the other two sharers first?

2097
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
We also made it to the stage

2098
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
right

2099
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
then next words

2100
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,000
of course we

2101
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Well

2102
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
We have prepared some topics

2103
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
wait a minute i will keep

2104
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
How many people will ask this

2105
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
this sharer

2106
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
then discuss with you

2107
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
After all

2108
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
In addition to what we just shared

2109
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Maybe some answers to some questions

2110
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
then let me respond first

2111
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Just now Director Cai mentioned several computers

2112
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I think it's actually quite interesting

2113
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
just mentioned

2114
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
noodle

2115
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
like our disaster prevention

2116
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
we will do drills

2117
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
face war

2118
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,000
then we will do

2119
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
this

2120
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,400
Hanguang exercise and so on

2121
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,020
But in the face of cognitive warfare

2122
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:04,720
Actually, we didn't do disaster drills.

2123
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,320
It was actually good just now

2124
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,320
right

2125
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:08,320
right

2126
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,320
right

2127
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,320
right

2128
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:13,560
So actually I think the clip I just mentioned

2129
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:14,760
just thought of saying

2130
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:16,520
We just saw a lot of scams

2131
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,720
It's all about cheating on points

2132
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,400
It's all a scam

2133
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:20,640
It's okay to cheat

2134
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,440
If today is to lie to us about Taiwan's sovereignty

2135
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,040
Because we had some discussions before

2136
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,040
will go through this discussion on the matter

2137
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:28,400
It is said that it is better to buy Taiwan than to fight Taiwan

2138
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,840
Buying Taiwan is worse than cheating Taiwan

2139
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,160
Yes, I even think about it by myself

2140
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,120
That is to say, are these

2141
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,440
It can be organized to understand who

2142
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,560
The ability to identify information is relatively weak

2143
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,840
then circle them

2144
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,320
Then for some Honeypot

2145
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,400
just keep posting the wrong message

2146
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,880
and then everyone messed up

2147
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,240
This is also an attack

2148
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:47,680
right

2149
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:48,320
This is actually

2150
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:50,280
And I think this is what I want in the future

2151
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,480
I think it's worth it

2152
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,520
Not necessarily that we are on this occasion

2153
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,280
there is a way to solve

2154
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,360
Because in fact, I think especially Q community works

2155
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:56,240
For example we can maybe

2156
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,880
You can get some data reports from some communities

2157
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,080
look at those who target disinformation

2158
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,200
Maybe you can see some fluctuations in the community

2159
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:06,000
But that's probably more like what we call an autopsy report

2160
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,200
We can look back when it's over

2161
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:10,800
OK, so this is how it happened

2162
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,600
But if you avoid it beforehand

2163
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,800
OK, the purpose of this event today

2164
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,400
Okay, so then I figured I'd let everyone come

2165
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:22,800
how many guests

2166
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,800
is to face the war

2167
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
Then I think this war contains many forms

2168
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,400
Entities really did shoot

2169
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,000
outside of war like cannon

2170
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,400
And we are now in a

2171
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,800
A State of We Call Gray Threat Hybrid War

2172
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,600
As if you could actually say we weren't at war

2173
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:41,800
aren't we attacked

2174
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,600
It doesn't seem to be the case

2175
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,800
we're under some kind of war

2176
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,200
Then how do we face such disinformation

2177
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,000
Let's say fake news, fake news

2178
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,800
or Xu A's message

2179
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,800
how should we face

2180
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:58,000
what tools do we have to deal with him

2181
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And if we don't have internet anymore

2182
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
What to do when online

2183
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,500
This problem seems a bit big and difficult

2184
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,500
I don't know which one has a way to respond to this with us first

2185
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,000
Did he just say you that tool

2186
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Can be used even when there is no Internet

2187
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Indeed he can use

2188
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:18,500
But the problem is you're inside it's a closed place

2189
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:19,500
he is a closed place

2190
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,500
you're inside assuming you're inside

2191
01:33:21,500 --> 01:33:23,000
you already have a team

2192
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,500
Then the information in your team will be released there.

2193
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:29,000
But that software he is not

2194
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
I don't think this is the use

2195
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
he is the use of a particular person

2196
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I think there may be something to say here

2197
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Everyone is concerned about, for example, the fact that there is no Internet disconnection.

2198
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I think especially for people who don't know how to use the Internet

2199
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,500
He will feel that this is a question of zero and one.

2200
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,000
You used it well today

2201
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
And no internet means I can't access anything

2202
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
It's not like that

2203
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,500
Like we have learned online for a long time

2204
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:57,000
The web is a very complex structure

2205
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
let's say

2206
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
you said there is no internet

2207
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,240
It's because you, let's say your home internet doesn't work.

2208
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,840
Or your mobile phone network is not available

2209
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,520
Then you probably have the satellite network still on.

2210
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,640
Or your radio is still there

2211
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,920
Or let's say the so-called internet blows up

2212
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:17,960
For example, suppose he has a way to cut off your country's external Internet access

2213
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,080
But your domestic network is good

2214
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,960
For example, if you feed Hsinchu people

2215
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:25,000
Then you blow up a communication center in Hsinchu

2216
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,760
then the other you are good

2217
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,800
And then and and this kind of stuff he's usually in

2218
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,200
after you hang him up

2219
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,400
He'll be back in a few hours or a day or two

2220
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,440
So he hangs up on the Internet, everyone, don't think about it

2221
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,640
Wow, once it hangs up, it's all gone

2222
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,040
no no no usually

2223
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:44,080
Usually in a proven environment

2224
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:45,800
He breaks all of a sudden

2225
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,000
or break something in an area

2226
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,720
So everyone, don't use zeros and ones to express this matter.

2227
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:55,800
Even if Ukraine is fine, the war situation in Ukraine is very, very critical

2228
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,040
Or when they actually have intermittent internet

2229
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,040
after that

2230
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,300
Almost everything online is actually good

2231
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:06,140
So this might just be a supplement for him.

2232
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,440
because I once had to answer a question

2233
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:11,260
I analyzed the whole thing to let people know

2234
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:15,620
The network is a very multi-node and multi-state thing

2235
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:18,180
It's not that you said that once you hang up, it will be gone.

2236
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:21,760
So everyone may have a correct understanding

2237
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,060
I think it's important to have a little mood just mentioned

2238
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,620
This is to promote the idea of ​​​​Taiwan Internet

2239
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,160
Did the previous topic talk about it?

2240
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,940
Our external communication

2241
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:33,520
Maybe we guide this communication network in Taiwan

2242
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,880
Still intact but our external Internet connection may be external Hailan

2243
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,660
potentially sabotage so we maybe

2244
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:43,000
I don’t know if my information security information is correct

2245
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,540
Maybe we can't watch Netflix

2246
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:46,080
But we can still go to PTT

2247
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:49,900
Because TPTT is a network in Taiwan

2248
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:52,220
But Netflix may introduce foreign servers

2249
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:55,280
Everyone is welcome to watch this Taiwan lecture on health last month.

2250
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,300
this activity

2251
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,360
There should be videos online

2252
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,360
then i think i want it too

2253
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,120
I want to ask again, if so

2254
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:04,600
Because like, especially otherwise, it means diplomatic marriage or Q club

2255
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,520
What's the use of the community

2256
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,160
just mentioned now

2257
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:08,240
major online communities

2258
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,400
In fact, it is an international platform

2259
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,520
Really if we meet and say yes

2260
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,480
Taiwan has us

2261
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,960
maybe intranet

2262
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,200
When the network in Taiwan's own island is still available

2263
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,200
Then if you encounter the external contact section

2264
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,280
do we have any other way

2265
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,960
Or do we have any method in advance?

2266
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,200
avoid this from happening

2267
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,000
or even when this happens

2268
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,320
We can still have a close relationship with the outside world

2269
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,600
or enough links

2270
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,120
Let us call for help

2271
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,520
I don't know if you have some experience or ideas like this

2272
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,920
Then I, I, just, just had

2273
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,080
The host mentioned the question of what to do if there is no Internet

2274
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:57,120
In fact, now the various communities

2275
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,080
In other words, the chief and the others can also use advertisements

2276
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,840
This kind of community-based broadcasting could be an alternative when the internet goes down

2277
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:08,840
And radio is also broadcasting is also a practice

2278
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:15,140
That said, now I know there are other teams working on the kind of mobile that can

2279
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:22,340
That is, one that can maintain a short-cast communication within a few kilometers.

2280
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,200
a machine like this

2281
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:28,000
For the short broadcast communication, you can actually buy the transmitter on Shopee

2282
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,240
If he is interested, he can buy it and play with it himself.

2283
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:34,720
And actually before the discussion of disconnection

2284
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:42,520
Everyone, we would like to bring you to discuss the communication network in case of emergency.

2285
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:47,020
Or does the network of contacts need to be established first

2286
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:49,000
whether domestic or foreign

2287
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,760
It is under a situation, whether it is a natural disaster or a war

2288
01:37:53,760 --> 01:38:00,020
Did your emergency contact person first anticipate who it is?

2289
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,140
Or you as a government unit

2290
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:05,240
Or you are an information dissemination unit

2291
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:08,500
Do you maintain a good relationship with foreign countries?

2292
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,980
when your country is in crisis

2293
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:15,740
Is there any way for units in other countries to take you to make an information report?

2294
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:19,420
dissemination of information or make a retweet

2295
01:38:19,420 --> 01:38:22,760
Because like now, let's say I also work at Radio Central

2296
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,720
The Central Radio Station and foreign radio stations

2297
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,420
is there to maintain a friendly relationship

2298
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:31,060
Then when one of the media is

2299
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:33,880
It is when there is no way to continue to spread information

2300
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:37,380
Can it be replaced by foreign media?

2301
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:38,920
that would say something like

2302
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:42,060
Ukraine they have three media companies

2303
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:46,760
Like Oneplus One Media and Starlight Media

2304
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:48,200
That is, they have three media

2305
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,860
It is an alliance with United News

2306
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:55,640
When they were at war, the three media outlets all spoke well.

2307
01:38:55,660 --> 01:38:58,240
If one of them suddenly couldn't broadcast the news

2308
01:38:58,240 --> 01:38:59,560
The other two have to make up

2309
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,100
All these communications and coordination must be done before the war

2310
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:04,940
you can't say

2311
01:39:04,940 --> 01:39:08,560
I started to fight, I'll come back and think about what I want

2312
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:09,700
this might be a bit too slow

2313
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:12,740
So in response to the fact that there was no internet just now

2314
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:15,720
These are the problems of self-communication

2315
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,940
In fact, we usually have to put

2316
01:39:18,940 --> 01:39:21,440
Contacts and our partners

2317
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,940
And this information network must first

2318
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:25,360
Everyone should talk first

2319
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,900
It's what it's like when you're on alert

2320
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:29,180
contingency measures

2321
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:32,060
Director

2322
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,140
Actually, I think it doesn't matter

2323
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:38,440
Just to answer this question

2324
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:42,300
Or we're watching him dissect Ukraine

2325
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:46,640
Some things to do in the face of this war

2326
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:48,440
In fact, there are some examples

2327
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:52,540
I'm still the same as I was in the briefing.

2328
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:53,800
that is

2329
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:57,640
It is to use the design method of one seat to one seat to generally improve

2330
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,700
Everyone for this information

2331
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,960
There is also the establishment of some collaborative mechanisms for the information network

2332
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,720
this matter is very important

2333
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,200
then it needs a drill

2334
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,360
Let's think about it a little more.

2335
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,840
For example, the exercise just mentioned

2336
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,640
Is it just an air defense exercise now?

2337
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,600
Or do we actually have to do more differently

2338
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,240
Some exercises for different possible situations

2339
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,080
That or relatively speaking

2340
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,800
Larger of these influential nodes

2341
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,320
do we need

2342
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,640
let them know they are in this

2343
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,120
possible situation

2344
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:33,200
what is his role

2345
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,880
then how will he follow

2346
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,600
Follow his people to do some communication

2347
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,640
Or do some emotional soothing actions?

2348
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:42,800
Or please support the frontline

2349
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,400
do something like this

2350
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,960
That may be through this way

2351
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:50,480
Do some information transfer and collaboration between people

2352
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,160
Just now Jiawei also mentioned

2353
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:54,760
Part of that is about government units

2354
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:56,280
between countries

2355
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,520
or those links between the State and other organizations

2356
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,080
actually i think

2357
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,740
The usual international network

2358
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:05,960
or business network

2359
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,700
In fact, they are all doing such things

2360
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:10,700
Just for the general public like this

2361
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:13,500
Have we prepared a mechanism

2362
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,700
to train everyone

2363
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:17,500
To raise awareness of this matter

2364
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,200
I haven't seen it yet

2365
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,500
but just saw

2366
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,800
Digital Diplomacy Association

2367
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,700
There are various roles for

2368
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:29,500
Start to develop some cooperation mechanisms like this

2369
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,300
i think its a good start

2370
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:33,300
That is, I hope everyone can support more

2371
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,300
also expand it

2372
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I feel like I am today

2373
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
whether online friends

2374
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,300
or friends present

2375
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:43,200
Everyone can recall

2376
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,400
did you memorize

2377
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,000
your closest

2378
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,900
Phone numbers of family members who live with relatives and friends

2379
01:41:50,900 --> 01:41:53,000
Because digital tools are very advanced now

2380
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,900
you now just press

2381
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:55,000
Regardless of Line Messenger

2382
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,300
Or receive a message according to that image

2383
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,400
Can you still remember that phone number?

2384
01:41:59,400 --> 01:41:59,900
good

2385
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,880
Looking back on this, I will remind everyone that

2386
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,840
Do you still remember that there is a way to communicate without the Internet?

2387
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:10,880
the phone called legacy

2388
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,760
Telephone lines are different from Internet lines.

2389
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,160
So actually

2390
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,440
i don't know what to do

2391
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:20,960
Compared with this age, it is good if everyone still has an impression

2392
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,400
Maybe there used to be a time when everyone in the house probably had a landline phone.

2393
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:28,120
There is a power outage, and the indoor phone can still be played.

2394
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,680
right good

2395
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,160
You may know this or before

2396
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:34,920
How to use radio

2397
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:37,240
But now everyone still knows how to use radio

2398
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:38,800
So we actually do some

2399
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:42,000
This one, we have discussed some issues related to the civil affairs before.

2400
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,160
when researching

2401
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:44,840
There is also an issue to pursue

2402
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:49,240
Everyone can think about the old public telephone

2403
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:50,800
Compared with the current public telephone

2404
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:52,160
It used to be more common

2405
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,560
Now the public telephones are slowly being dismantled

2406
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,600
It's just the coin or the phone card.

2407
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,280
But in fact to some extent

2408
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,600
It is a temporary reservation

2409
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,100
Why?

2410
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:06,140
Those are the few that can stay

2411
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:08,200
A Tool for Direct Talk

2412
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:10,500
So after going back I think this is a

2413
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:11,260
take home message

2414
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,300
is a national job

2415
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,300
can remember

2416
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:14,840
just put it on your back

2417
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,380
Do you know the phone number of your loved one

2418
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:17,400
what does it look like

2419
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:17,920
right

2420
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,980
You may just be out of battery

2421
01:43:19,980 --> 01:43:21,500
ok you now see a pay phone

2422
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,780
ok i'm going to call my family

2423
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,580
then you just look at that phone

2424
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:26,120
then i don't know what to do

2425
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:26,880
no above

2426
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,180
you don't know how to contact each other

2427
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,980
Even if the other party's mobile phone can communicate

2428
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,000
The other party's phone can be reached

2429
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,280
but you can't remember

2430
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,580
i want acosmetic

2431
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:38,400
Like I can't really remember some phone calls right now

2432
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,680
Subject's phone

2433
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:40,440
because

2434
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:43,260
It's just that everyone has a mobile phone now, so they can check it directly.

2435
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,060
So it's also a possibility

2436
01:43:45,060 --> 01:43:46,840
issues worth discussing

2437
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,360
because

2438
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:48,640
reason

2439
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,400
that is

2440
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:50,680
without these things

2441
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:53,240
How do we go when there is no way to inquire

2442
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:54,520
hit us

2443
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,320
Contact usWant to contact

2444
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:56,820
right

2445
01:43:56,820 --> 01:43:58,620
this is also a key

2446
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,560
I just mentioned that when we are doing research

2447
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,760
So found this

2448
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,800
Of course there is another very important point

2449
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,400
Except your own living relatives and friends

2450
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:10,080
and your neighbors

2451
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,040
well maybe you're not where you live

2452
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:13,040
you want to make sure

2453
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,920
because something happened

2454
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,200
Maybe the disaster or the war situation is better

2455
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,960
You want to settle into the space you live in now

2456
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:22,880
is it still suitable to go back or something

2457
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,520
do you know your next door neighbor's phone number

2458
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,240
because our society

2459
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:28,320
Maybe everyone is crossing back

2460
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:29,640
maybe not that friendly

2461
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,960
so i think it's a good opportunity

2462
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,680
We actually just actually

2463
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:36,240
Bowen-Habba or take a few writers to mention that

2464
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,280
sometimes you really have to go out and get to know each other

2465
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,400
know beforehand

2466
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,000
This is a normal God of War conversion

2467
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
We should always be good neighbors and good friends with everyone

2468
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Only in time of war can we become each other

2469
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,640
is a helping partner

2470
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,320
get to know them

2471
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,800
Then get to know your contact information

2472
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,760
if there is a need for war

2473
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,000
or in times of disaster

2474
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,720
that's a way to build closer intimacy

2475
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,160
point to point to line

2476
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
A More Socially Human Approach

2477
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,500
This is a bit far

2478
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:07,500
But I think this is a good place for everyone to go back as homework

2479
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,500
Then I want to come back and I want to ask you a little more

2480
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,000
Just now I think just now is an important

2481
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:18,500
It's a phone number where you can go back and meet people around you.

2482
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:20,000
back it up again

2483
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:26,500
Well, personally, what else can our individual characters do in a war?

2484
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,500
But I think some of the examples mentioned earlier

2485
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:31,000
I don't know if there is more I want to share with you, that is

2486
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
It seems that the person seems to be very helpless

2487
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,500
But we found that regardless of experience in Ukraine

2488
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:37,000
or experience in other countries

2489
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
In fact, it seems that many people can use different methods

2490
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,500
to demonstrate one's own expertise

2491
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:45,000
Go for defense maybe Ukraine

2492
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,500
ukraine defense ukraine

2493
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,000
or Taiwanese professionals

2494
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
You can use your own profession to defend Taiwan

2495
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,500
I don't know if anyone has more experiences like this

2496
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,500
Or share with you what you think you can do

2497
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:59,500
I think I want to take this opportunity to speak

2498
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,840
Let's talk about it, I actually started talking about it on the first page

2499
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:06,200
In fact, from the very beginning we were afraid and hesitant

2500
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,760
and then slowly find a way

2501
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,080
But I think the process

2502
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,320
In fact, most people have

2503
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:16,200
But most of them don't really have a way to figure out how to do it

2504
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:19,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't have spent so long looking for it at that time.

2505
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:23,360
But I think this is something to focus on.

2506
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,640
That is to say, you are actually giving the public a guideline

2507
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:30,840
what should you do and learn

2508
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,200
Then come to the state of this thing

2509
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,880
Well, this thing is actually a guideline.

2510
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,040
that's what you can make you think about

2511
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:43,200
If there are millions of people trying to figure this thing out

2512
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:45,160
what a waste of time it is

2513
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,200
Then if you give it a guideline

2514
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:50,480
Let's say I start off by saying I've produced a lot of good stuff, right?

2515
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,080
If you see it at first

2516
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,080
Then I don't have to search for these

2517
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,440
I just go straight to the black bear and report something

2518
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,000
you're right into the situation

2519
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,960
i think we might

2520
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,360
I think often when we discuss these

2521
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:07,960
as if we all

2522
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:10,520
all in one

2523
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:11,960
higher position

2524
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,920
For example, what should our government do?

2525
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:14,840
what to do in taiwan

2526
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:15,880
so and so

2527
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,000
just bigger

2528
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,400
i think he should

2529
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,160
The left eye is on very, very simple things

2530
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:22,560
each of you

2531
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,640
what can be done

2532
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:24,720
that actually

2533
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,360
when each man is exploring what he can do

2534
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,840
when something needs to be done

2535
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,760
if there are some guidelines

2536
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:32,040
let him just know

2537
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:33,960
Like I can do this, this, this, this

2538
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,240
That's actually

2539
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:37,800
those fears or those things

2540
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,840
naturally not there

2541
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:40,720
and this thing

2542
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:42,160
This is how we learn information

2543
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:44,760
your method is simpler

2544
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,560
the more common your stuff

2545
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:50,520
The more people you reach, the more

2546
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,320
then what we're talking about is

2547
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,360
The cases we are calling for here

2548
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:57,280
In fact, most of what can be done is

2549
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,040
People with resources or pipelines and rights

2550
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,080
Then why don't you think about how to make millions of people

2551
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,240
they can both do the same thing

2552
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,560
That power is terrifying

2553
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,960
it's huge

2554
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,800
To you millions of people want to say

2555
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:18,320
Hey I want to do something for this land

2556
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,600
i gotta get up and do something

2557
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,600
Everyone will find his way

2558
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,400
Yes, I think it is really to appeal to everyone

2559
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,360
just find something

2560
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,760
can help

2561
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,680
then go see for yourself

2562
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:40,040
Yes, subscribe to send a message every month, anything is actually good

2563
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:41,880
as long as you think it's something

2564
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:43,680
and most importantly you have to do

2565
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:46,240
I think this concept is more important

2566
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,480
I think today's audience might be right

2567
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,000
This topic is of particular interest

2568
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,560
Then if you are from the academic group, you can follow

2569
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,080
Haba and QCircuit

2570
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,040
Those in the Xuewen group can follow me like this

2571
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I think it's spreading

2572
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,440
Why we keep pushing

2573
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:05,240
Because the threshold for spreading this matter is very low

2574
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,000
that is

2575
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,840
Uh, for example, you can practice taking pictures first

2576
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:09,940
Practice video starts

2577
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:11,640
What can I do when I practice taking pictures and practicing videos?

2578
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,800
It can be used to collect evidence during war

2579
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:15,880
Because Ukraine they have a program

2580
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,040
they are

2581
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,840
Uh, by contacting legal experts

2582
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:21,040
They are teaching people how

2583
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,280
Searching for evidence of Russian atrocities

2584
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:26,320
So you just practice taking pictures and uh, video

2585
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,520
This matter is actually

2586
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:29,120
You are a citizen in time of war

2587
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:31,400
you can play your part

2588
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:32,920
that or in normal times

2589
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:36,440
You can go to, uh, look at the ones that are said to be abroad.

2590
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,080
What are the channels on social media

2591
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,000
For example, hey, what is Reddy's Taiwanese version doing?

2592
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,040
go shopping

2593
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:42,360
Then or say, Hey Reddy's

2594
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,080
Uh, Reddy is the American PTT

2595
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:45,640
then go and see them

2596
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:48,200
what is ukraine like on reddy

2597
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,240
to explain to foreigners

2598
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:51,520
what happened in your own country

2599
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:53,200
They have opened many versions of their own

2600
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:55,080
There are actually many on Telegram

2601
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,480
uh ukrainian channel

2602
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,920
For example, uh Ukrainel or

2603
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,040
Ukrainel

2604
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,240
Nexta is also a Telegram conduit

2605
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:07,200
Anyway, go to other social platforms to tweet more

2606
01:50:07,200 --> 01:50:09,440
Reddit or Telegram

2607
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:12,720
Take a stroll around these places you are not usually familiar with

2608
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,720
then you will know

2609
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:16,120
Okay, so what if something happens today?

2610
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:19,760
I just want to go to these social platforms to transfer information

2611
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,160
That is usually to record these pipes

2612
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:25,120
Of course, our society usually does this kind of work.

2613
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,360
Then the first person in our community will probably

2614
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,000
Because I just saw an audience ask

2615
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,480
There are about 400 sponsors this year

2616
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,000
So these 400+ patrons

2617
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:34,760
we will

2618
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,840
We want to be a community

2619
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,680
So we now have a Facebook group

2620
01:50:39,680 --> 01:50:41,600
Digital Diplomacy Research Office

2621
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,720
Then we start the second half of the year

2622
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:46,000
regularly in the community

2623
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,480
To do some network defense for everyone

2624
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,560
Some topics from the rehearsal will be thrown out

2625
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,440
And then there are some Ukrainian ones

2626
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:54,840
feel they do a good job with the site

2627
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:55,560
or case

2628
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,320
We will share with you in the community

2629
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:59,400
So if you are interested in this

2630
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:00,040
then want

2631
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,020
In addition to these 400 people, I also want to come together

2632
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:05,920
Take this online walkthrough exercise

2633
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:07,520
and want to know more about the future

2634
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,140
That is, if there is some event information in the future

2635
01:51:10,140 --> 01:51:13,980
You can search for the Digital Diplomacy Lab in the Facebook group

2636
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:16,840
Then we will do something like this in the second half of the year.

2637
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,680
This is how the online drill looks like, thank you

2638
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,980
Okay, I think that's just what we're discussing.

2639
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,200
So I still have to focus on what I want to express to the government

2640
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:33,680
It is true that, for example, no matter the country

2641
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:36,500
It's just an exercise, or the training of the national army.

2642
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:39,900
I think these things are kind of stuck in the

2643
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:41,700
Maybe a few versions ago

2644
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:44,240
Then it actually has a lot of room for optimization

2645
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,640
Yes, for example, the media is trying to educate

2646
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:51,280
Is it that the general public has no mandatory self-cognition

2647
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:53,600
Or is it actually related to national defense?

2648
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,640
That's what we're talking about today, right?

2649
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:59,440
Does this thing need to be a little semi-mandatory?

2650
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,200
or do you need

2651
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,400
Do you need to use some ways to encourage everyone?

2652
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:05,900
To raise awareness and discussion about this stuff

2653
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:07,300
then i think it's

2654
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:09,800
Because I don't know which unit is responsible for this

2655
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:12,000
Maybe it's the Department of Books, or the Ministry of Defense.

2656
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,400
Anyway, if you really want to do this

2657
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,900
In fact, the government can reconsider

2658
01:52:16,900 --> 01:52:18,400
how is this thing designed

2659
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,000
Then how to let

2660
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,600
Just like what his dad said

2661
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,200
get more people involved

2662
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,200
Because of course I believe that folk power is very

2663
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,400
very powerful

2664
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:29,900
But in fact, if you only look at Taiwanese society

2665
01:52:29,900 --> 01:52:33,100
It is very difficult to gather consensus

2666
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,600
is there something

2667
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:36,400
probably relatively speaking

2668
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:40,300
That is, the official resources are available to support everyone.

2669
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:42,600
Or classify the roles?

2670
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:44,400
that is of course if

2671
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,100
I think now some parts

2672
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,700
may still stay

2673
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,200
so-called hardware

2674
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,300
But what we are discussing today is more software-oriented

2675
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:53,900
network of people

2676
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:55,200
It's actually soft

2677
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,600
Information dissemination is actually software-oriented

2678
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,400
the training of these things

2679
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:00,200
There are mechanisms

2680
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,640
The establishment seems to have less pondering in the past

2681
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:06,840
Is it necessary to spend more time cultivating him in recent years?

2682
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,400
I think it will be a problem that everyone may have to face in the future.

2683
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:14,200
Because of course it's too easy to buy a weapon

2684
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,900
So buying a weapon is of course an international declaration.

2685
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:18,200
But what?

2686
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:21,200
that networking we're talking about today

2687
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:23,200
How can it be generally improved

2688
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,800
How can we start an open discussion

2689
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,400
conscious discussion

2690
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:30,000
This is actually what everyone has to face now

2691
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,080
that can't

2692
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,800
Ah Fa can't be talking about those of us

2693
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:36,440
Maybe someone who is already interested is discussing it here

2694
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:39,200
but those possibilities

2695
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,800
Originally, he might face life just thinking that

2696
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,880
Oh this thing has nothing to do with me

2697
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,600
How is he going to get involved in this?

2698
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:49,840
I think everything can be thought and designed

2699
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,280
That is

2700
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,880
what i want to say to the government

2701
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,880
because I think it is

2702
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,200
um yes

2703
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,200
possible

2704
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,400
lost something

2705
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,000
Like actually I think just now

2706
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
come meet air defense exercise

2707
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I also often ask

2708
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
That's the alarm

2709
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Everyone can move, is that all?

2710
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
or what are we going to do

2711
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,000
I'm a bit confused about the purpose of this exercise

2712
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
So actually on this

2713
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I believe there is much more that can be done

2714
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Director Cai's reminder just now

2715
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I think it's very heavy

2716
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
this is an important reminder

2717
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Because in fact, we are now in Taiwan

2718
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I don't have to speak for the government first.

2719
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
That is to say, compared with the past few years, we are now

2720
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
In fact, there is indeed continuous progress

2721
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
But I think it's also because

2722
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
In the process of seeing such progress

2723
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So it will be more tense, that is to say

2724
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
why not fast enough

2725
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Why do you still seem to be walking slowly

2726
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
maybe that's their limit

2727
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
The pace of the government may be slower

2728
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
so i think this comes back

2729
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Today's topic is Xiao Bo Da

2730
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I'm actually thinking about when this little uncle was growing up

2731
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Think about it from another angle

2732
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,040
Not so much small or large to some extent

2733
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,200
Kind of like our role today is all bottom up

2734
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,640
How to use the power of the people

2735
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:12,940
what do we do

2736
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:16,400
to bring about change in the government

2737
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:20,340
This is just an example of what we say and do.

2738
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:23,080
In fact, it’s like lying on the grass, we have previously focused on the issue of civil defense

2739
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:25,440
We made a civil defense manual of the original folk version

2740
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:27,540
after we did

2741
01:55:27,540 --> 01:55:29,440
The Defense Forces of course also have their version out

2742
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:32,400
We're all around 2022

2743
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:33,600
It came out around the sixth day of the new year

2744
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,200
do it

2745
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,200
after comparison

2746
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:41,600
In 2023, the Ministry of Defense decided to make a new version of the Civil Defense Manual

2747
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:43,200
OK, what does this mean? It means

2748
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,100
There is more progress

2749
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:47,100
When the folks made a version

2750
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:49,000
The Ministry of National Defense or government departments may read it and say

2751
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:51,300
well , he has a reference

2752
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:53,100
Even if maybe doing this will work

2753
01:55:53,300 --> 01:55:54,700
He is also more confident that

2754
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:56,900
I can maybe try this place

2755
01:55:57,100 --> 01:55:59,500
So including the example that Haba just mentioned before

2756
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,720
They folk our own energy

2757
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,840
Let's start with a small-scale approach with small resources

2758
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,320
After doing a minimum feasible solution first

2759
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,680
Hey, the police, hey, some policemen are still participating in this event

2760
01:56:08,680 --> 01:56:11,480
Hey, I can use it in my official business

2761
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:13,480
If it can work, it will be added

2762
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:15,120
or I believe the Society for Mathematical Diplomacy has many

2763
01:56:15,120 --> 01:56:16,520
In fact, the experience of cooperating with the official department

2764
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:17,520
will find out that

2765
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,840
In fact, many of them are willing to try

2766
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,160
but they have their burdens

2767
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,160
have their baggage

2768
01:56:23,160 --> 01:56:25,160
I dare not jump in like this in one breath.

2769
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:27,600
So this is an obstacle they have

2770
01:56:27,600 --> 01:56:29,600
It's also very similar to our folks who have to first

2771
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:30,720
as a young uncle

2772
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,720
Close first

2773
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:32,720
go and show them

2774
01:56:32,720 --> 01:56:35,400
Just say OK we're doing this workable

2775
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:36,800
can be successful

2776
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,200
They just jumped in betting resources

2777
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,320
Then scale this up

2778
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,200
but i think this thing

2779
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:44,320
In fact, I just thought that this Q-Such major also has something to do with it.

2780
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,600
I feel as though we can't just put a responsibility like that

2781
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,800
blame the government

2782
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:49,360
In fact, there is another very important role is

2783
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,360
The role of these big platforms

2784
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,200
Well, I think we just discussed this thing today

2785
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,320
remind me of a theme

2786
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,000
Because actually I know how many there are in Taiwan now

2787
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
The international big platform is now in

2788
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Regardless of whether you are practicing or singing, you are studying and saying

2789
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,760
They seem to be trying to provide a funding

2790
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:05,480
Let us, the civil society in Taiwan, offer some projects

2791
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:07,920
Proposal to do something regardless of the media system

2792
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:12,920
Or related news, compensation and other plans

2793
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:15,880
To make Taiwan society better, this digital citizen willful

2794
01:57:15,880 --> 01:57:18,320
Maybe I think we just mentioned these projects

2795
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:21,480
These directions are worth following whether it is Google

2796
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,000
Facebook or some large digital platform

2797
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,760
Check out some of their directions for proposals

2798
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,800
Or whether it's the audience in the audience or the friends online

2799
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
If you have such an idea, you can actually go

2800
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:32,360
search related information

2801
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:33,760
I think it's a

2802
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:35,920
Another change

2803
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:38,200
because they are more resilient than the government sector

2804
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,240
There are also resources

2805
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,480
can make some things go faster

2806
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:43,320
Improve Taiwan's social willfulness

2807
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,280
Well, I actually think that the whole scene just now

2808
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:50,360
One thing that strikes me as something to give back is to say

2809
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,800
In fact, we generally think that it is the same in the face of war.

2810
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:56,280
From the very beginning, it seems that

2811
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:59,560
There must be defenses such as tanks, aircraft, missiles, etc.

2812
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
but

2813
01:58:02,180 --> 01:58:04,520
In fact, we just discovered through this field event

2814
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,080
Not really, we have so many ways

2815
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:09,700
Can improve Taiwan's defense

2816
01:58:09,700 --> 01:58:11,680
improve our defense

2817
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:12,960
then we

2818
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,760
Uh, before our analogy would be something like

2819
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,700
You can imagine Taiwan's defense

2820
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:19,520
maybe like a tower of refinement

2821
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:21,840
if you really wanna get a gun

2822
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,800
the one who operates the tank

2823
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,360
This operational missile goes to war

2824
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:28,260
You can go to the very top, the very top of this participation

2825
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:29,580
join our army

2826
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:31,100
to get involved in the Ministry of Defense

2827
01:58:31,300 --> 01:58:34,020
But we also know that it is not

2828
01:58:34,020 --> 01:58:37,160
Because in fact, if you want to participate, you want to go to the heavy army, you still have conditions

2829
01:58:37,160 --> 01:58:40,160
How old are you, and what about your physical condition?

2830
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:41,540
if you can't

2831
01:58:41,540 --> 01:58:43,480
In fact, there are many things to participate in

2832
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:46,340
In fact, there are some in various counties and cities

2833
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,400
Uh, the police units are open

2834
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,120
you can join the community

2835
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:51,600
civil defense groups

2836
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:54,920
This may be the police unit, you can authorize relevant information

2837
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:57,000
You can join one of the communities like this

2838
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,780
civil defense team

2839
01:58:58,780 --> 01:59:00,240
or

2840
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,460
Actually, let's take a step back

2841
01:59:02,460 --> 01:59:05,000
when there is a real war or war

2842
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,500
you just have to do one thing

2843
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:08,500
you can save yourself

2844
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,000
no other trouble

2845
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Don't need other governments and PhDs to help you

2846
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
It's already a blessing

2847
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
If you can save yourself today

2848
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
your family

2849
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
your community

2850
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Then if they can have such a defense

2851
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Or at least don't need help

2852
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
If you still want to come to Huazhi to help you

2853
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
If every community has such basic capabilities

2854
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
In fact, we are facing the war we may encounter

2855
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
will be more resistant

2856
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I think it's actually something everyone can do

2857
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
you probably didn't think to say

2858
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,000
It turns out that this incident actually helps our defense.

2859
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
But actually silently

2860
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
learn more by yourself

2861
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
learn more over there

2862
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Guo Xiang just mentioned

2863
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
try yourself, contact yourself

2864
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
no matter what you do on the internet

2865
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Occasionally post articles

2866
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
To establish some contacts with international friends

2867
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Or walk to some physical activities

2868
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
to learn some skills

2869
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Or just know someone

2870
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,100
In fact, it is unconsciously improving Taiwan's defense against possible wars.

2871
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:06,400
Enhance the social humanity of our citizens

2872
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,000
I wonder if there are a few people who haven't added anything today?

2873
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
OK, thanks

2874
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:14,340
add a concept

2875
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:16,140
In our business world

2876
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:17,920
Actually, I want this first

2877
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,740
What I want to express is that this is called risk management

2878
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:22,780
that is, your risk management

2879
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:25,080
If you have a possible risk in the future

2880
02:00:25,080 --> 02:00:26,380
war is a big risk

2881
02:00:26,380 --> 02:00:28,160
Regardless of the fact that I sometimes

2882
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,700
so-called community

2883
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:34,300
I'm a pauper and I don't risk as much as you rich people

2884
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:38,400
You have a lot of money, you are an entrepreneur, what, what, your risk is much bigger than mine

2885
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:40,440
because you have a lot to lose

2886
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:43,780
Then we we are alone, he is equivalent to not early but

2887
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:46,600
But most importantly he is actually a concept of risk

2888
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:48,640
then you at your risk

2889
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:53,500
You should invest to curb his risk no matter what method you use

2890
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:55,040
to restrain him

2891
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,920
If I were an entrepreneur, I would like to invest in these civic communities

2892
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000
You just give him a little donation, give him a little support

2893
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
For him, it is something that can amplify his strength many times

2894
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Then you invest a little bit

2895
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
It is very valuable for your risk control

2896
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Then I take this opportunity to appeal

2897
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
In case some of them belong to rich people

2898
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
use your money like this

2899
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
is the most effective investment

2900
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
There are many caring people here

2901
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
they actually look like that

2902
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Digital Diplomacy Association

2903
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
In fact, I think they raised hundreds of thousands of funds.

2904
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I actually have a really bad headache

2905
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Something so important to the country has to come out to raise funds

2906
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Then we got fundraising and only got a few hundred thousand

2907
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Rich people, think about it yourself

2908
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
How do you protect your money?

2909
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Thanks

2910
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
that event last

2911
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I think we should remind everyone

2912
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Attorney General Guo just reminded everyone

2913
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
To click like, post these various units Q search

2914
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
and Haba or all diplomatic societies

2915
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
There is another very important unit that everyone must forget

2916
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,000
You can also search for lying tide digging

2917
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Welcome everyone to press like, leave a message, share and subscribe to open the small bell

2918
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Lock our various related reports

2919
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
In fact, our issue of civil defense

2920
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Or especially this issue last month about critical infrastructure

2921
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
We all have some relevant news stories

2922
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Is it the last addition?

2923
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
i want to add

2924
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Because what we are discussing today has a topic called

2925
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
very confident

2926
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,000
We discuss these things very confidently

2927
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Then we need to optimize everyone's awareness and cognition of these things.

2928
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Of course I think it takes a little bit of self-confidence

2929
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
That is to say that it is a bit like the media leading the way.

2930
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
It’s just that Taiwanese people like to line up, right?

2931
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,000
So actually I think it should be broad

2932
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Possibly set up some workshops

2933
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
or set up some lectures like this

2934
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
And maybe use it as a marketing campaign

2935
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
go get these people in

2936
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
and when these seeds are scattered

2937
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Everyone will know better how to discuss this topic

2938
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Yes, you see, of course today's lecture is free to attend.

2939
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
But are there some

2940
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
so-called network optimization strategy

2941
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
can go and take some people slowly

2942
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
For the idea of ​​this question, pull it out

2943
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Then let them be willing to discuss this matter with the people around him

2944
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
I think it's a big topic too

2945
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Of course this matter

2946
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
He is education, right?

2947
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
So actually I would say

2948
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Really, why keep talking to the government?

2949
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
because I think the government can be on top of this

2950
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:36,000
do a lot of thinking and do a lot of trying

2951
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
that's only possible now

2952
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I think it's more important

2953
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:43,000
What I do must have a performance

2954
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
But it's hard for him to measure performance

2955
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
to him is an education

2956
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
He is just promotional

2957
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
So all I can think of is to do more of this.

2958
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Then let everyone have such thoughts

2959
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
let these seeds disperse more

2960
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Discuss with everyone, inspire with everyone

2961
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
more likely like

2962
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,300
Like this, people like Dad come out

2963
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,120
Set a problem by yourself and solve this problem like this

2964
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,440
Of course, this kind of toughness is generally improved.

2965
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,340
Thank you very much for Director Jiang's supplement

2966
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:17,140
Then I believe that today we have a lot of calls to the government

2967
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:19,980
Taiwan Internet Lecture Hall will post this news recently

2968
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:21,760
pass it on to our senior management

2969
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,340
Or in front of the screen, or friends at the scene

2970
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:27,900
If it was mentioned just now, like Dad mentioned, people with great resources

2971
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,440
we have four here

2972
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,240
you are welcome

2973
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:32,780
provide resources

2974
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:34,820
The risk of war inside the drop plane

2975
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:37,120
Alright, that's the end of today's activities.

2976
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:39,160
Or do you have anything to add?

2977
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:41,480
ok i think that's it we will

2978
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:44,560
This is the end of today's event, thank you for your participation

2979
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,600
Thank you also for this online

2980
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:48,380
The audience should currently have

2981
02:04:48,380 --> 02:04:50,680
I don't remember saying there should be around 70 bits

2982
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:52,480
That

2983
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:56,320
I saw his question, the cheering one just now has an appropriate reply

2984
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:59,400
Then Dad also helped us reply on the message board.

2985
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:00,120
then i think we are today

2986
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
This is the end of today's activities

2987
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Thanks again to all of our speakers today

2988
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Then I will also advertise

2989
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Our next lecture event

2990
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
More interesting topics will be discussed

2991
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
The Social Responsibility of Internet Celebrities

2992
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Then you are welcome to come to us again

2993
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000

thank you all

2996
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Then we have posted in this message area

2997
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Satisfaction survey for today's event

2998
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
