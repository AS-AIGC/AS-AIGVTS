00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
music

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:30,000
music

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The Central Research Institute's

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
nine-month knowledge review

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
speech will begin.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's welcome Director Wang Yu

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
to give us a round of applause.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
applause

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good evening, everyone.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Today, I think it's

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,460
Vice President Wang Fansheng came to host

12
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,960
he is also a historian

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,800
So you can put this

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,600
It is also a good research partner with today's speaker

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,160
but today he is sick

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,960
So I'm here to introduce

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,660
but i want to have a

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
I'm the first to have the same sex with him

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,560
Second, I also care about history

20
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,120
So on this principle

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,020
Let me briefly introduce to you

22
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,520
our keynote speaker today

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,020
Today's speaker is Academician Wang Mingke

24
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,960
Academician Wang Mingke graduated from

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,220
Department of History, National Taiwan Normal University

26
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,920
1992

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,160
Earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,380
since 84

29
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,140
He has been in the Institute's History Research

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,540
language institute

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,140
In fact, the Institute of History

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The original research institute is also the largest and relatively old one in our institute.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He used to teach in other than Academia Sinica

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He also taught at National Taiwan University, Soochow University, Chung Hsing University

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He was also transferred to Chung Hsing University as the Dean of Culture and Propaganda

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That was 2010 to 2013

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In 2014, that is, last year, he was elected as a Third World Academician of the Institute of Election Research

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's also currently a special review researcher at our Institute of History.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Dr. Wang from 94 to 2003

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have been to western Sichuan many times, and there are three companies in Minjiang who have accumulated one-year experience

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,740
gun for field research

42
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,840
From zero three to zero seven

43
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,500
Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai

44
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,820
Inspect the local environment

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,940
The ecology of human beings with Youmu

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,780
2007 to present

47
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,780
His field research moved to

48
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,900
Sichuan, Liangshan, etc.

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,980
minority autonomous regions

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
Tibetan

51
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,460
Yizu etc.

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,100
The subject of study is history

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
Multifaceted local

54
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,960
and their living in human

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,580
The meaning of social development

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,840
so

57
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,960
This is also very special

58
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,300
So the number of people who signed up today is

59
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,280
Far more than

60
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,660
Over the years

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If it is not enough to do, there is a TV broadcast outside

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,400
The results of Dr. Wang's field research on Jiangzhang ethnic minorities

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:23,640
It also illustrates the historical process of China and its fringe interdependence.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,600
The results are also shown in a series of recent works

65
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,000
From 1997 published the edge of Huaxia

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,400
2003 Guns between Han and Tibet

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,400
2006 is Heroes Ancestors and Brothers Democracy

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,000
2009 is the nomad's choice

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This year he published Reflection on History and Historiography Reflection

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
If you are interested in this series of works

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,120
can be used as a reference

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
Then I'll stop talking nonsense, please

73
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
Dr. Wang started his speech

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,240
I want to thank Dean Wang for introducing me.

75
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,160
I also want to thank the Central Plains Academy for giving me this opportunity

76
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
name feasting on knowledge

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,280
to put some of my research

78
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
Some small thoughts to share with you

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
Since it's a feast

80
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,640
i think we all take it easy

81
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,600
But today so many people came to this speech

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,120
first i think

83
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Maybe I got the title right

84
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,360
everybody really cares about history

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,680
let's see

86
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Actually what I'm going to talk about is

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,060
You know what history we care about

88
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,400
Because we knew from the beginning that people cared about history

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,960
All right

90
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,540
Recently, everyone knows that in Taiwan some

91
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,360
Controversy over the History Curriculum of the State Religion

92
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,220
There is also a grand commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War in mainland China

93
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,520
international controversy

94
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,600
Looks like it's all history's fault

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,920
So what kind of history do we care about?

96
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,480
Is it a historical fact?

97
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,580
Or how the historical facts should be written and presented

98
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,160
Or we really should be vested in history

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,700
strengthened

100
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,360
let everyone

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,800
Let us all know the lessons of history

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,840
or history should be forgotten

103
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,420
Don't be a burden to contemporary people

104
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,960
That

105
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,260
I guess someone might say I don't care about history

106
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,820
Is it true that some people don't care about history?

107
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,100
i don't think so

108
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,140
I'll tell you in a minute because we didn't

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,700
Everyone lives in a world created by history

110
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,400
At least some of you care about the history of the stock

111
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,500
The history of the company's earnings and its own adjustment history

112
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,800
and i think

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,180
Many couples care about each other's social history before marriage

114
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,280
so

115
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,860
What is the history we care about?

116
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,160
a very interesting phenomenon

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,520
It is the history in Chinese and the history in English

118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,060
Both are one word with two meanings

119
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,420
One meaning is those things that really happened in the past

120
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,960
there is another meaning

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,820
It is people's memories, recollections and narratives of the past.

122
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,380
In fact, these two are completely different things

123
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,760
Why is it the same word in both English and Chinese?

124
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,620
In fact, there is a French scholar from all over the world, Portico

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,480
have mentioned this

126
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,840
He said that we people live in the real world created by history

127
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,440
Is the cause of history

128
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,200
So we also write history in this world

129
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,760
is making history

130
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,760
So we kind of mix those two things up

131
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,320
so we think

132
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,480
Our historical facts and representations of historical memory

133
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,160
Seems like they're all the same thing

134
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,640
so good

135
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,880
So let's talk about history that people care about

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:37,080
In fact, it is just the history I used to add the quartition mark

137
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,200
To refer to people's memory and expression of the past

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,840
Because no matter how many real things that happened in the past

139
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,360
No matter how accurately we reconstruct and state the facts of what happened in the past

140
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,960
It's all about our choices about these facts

141
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
and how do we express it

142
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,040
Our expressions relate to our words

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
arrangement with law

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
These are deeply influenced by our society

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and the influence of our individual situations in society

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So because of history and the social reality people live in and the identity of the individual during the period?

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
closely related

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So simply speaking, we live in a society created by history.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
especially living within the personal identities that history has created

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So it is difficult for us to recognize the influence of society on the construction of history

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Even because of this, we don't really have a very good understanding of the social reality we live in.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So I'm going to explain my arguments to you

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then my method is a very special

154
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is related to my research

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It is from a society that is very strange and strange to us

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,160
Get started with some history as locals believe

157
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,840
to show how they live in the history of their own making

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,840
and related reality

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,760
How do they care about history and argue with others about history?

160
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,200
that's what i said

161
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,240
Walter is familiar with

162
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,800
This is what I spent more than ten years

163
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Research done on the Sichuan-Tibet Plateau

164
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
But that's only half of my research

165
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,760
my other half

166
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
is the logic i use like this

167
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,920
Let's rethink the records in Chinese historical documents

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
So this means

169
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm the same in this speech

170
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,600
When I turn the stranger into the familiar

171
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
I want to explain what we are familiar with

172
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,680
The history of what you believe in and what you care about

173
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,280
peculiar in fact

174
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,160
He was identified under a specific social situation

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They also reinforce a social situation like this

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is Huashu Sivict

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
My example is the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Look at these three circles

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can see that Chengdu is in this place

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This place is the Chengdu Plain

181
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Its height is about 6,000 meters

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
instead of around 600 meters

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
what about this place

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This place is Songpan plateau here

185
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What about the plateau area here?

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
about 3600 meters

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In other words, the drop is 3,000 meters

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
so this place

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Mountains and heavy lakes almost like steps

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
so what about this place

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is caused by the extrusion of these two road blocks.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Zhe District

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So there is a very rich humanities here

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
natural geographical landscape, plants

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's the one over here and it's very rich

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,500
Then the gun bamboo I want to talk about first I want to introduce is here

197
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Then the Jiarong Zangzhu I introduced is here

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
Here are two mountains and one bamboo

199
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,500
so in this area

200
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
In fact, everyone should not think that these are three ethnic groups

201
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,500
In fact, before the ethnic surveys in mainland China identified and classified

202
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,000
The people here are especially Tibetan bamboo and spear bamboo

203
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,500
They all said that we have never heard of Tibetan bamboo

204
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
never heard

205
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
This is the name someone gave us

206
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
we have to accept

207
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,000
So there are actually a lot of ethnic groups here

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
people in every little valley

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,500
He thinks he is a special group

210
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
And it has nothing to do with the people around

211
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
So this is my field

212
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
My field is a multi-point field

213
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
That is to say, this green

214
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
is the field point representing me

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is the same as the so-called squatting of many anthropologists

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
At one point the ones that do it are not quite the same

217
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,800
So my research on gun bamboo

218
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,000
The name of the book is Guns Between Han and Tibet

219
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
so you look at these two pictures

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
you can see what's up with them

221
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,600
This is the spear bamboo in the east of Beichuan

222
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,400
except me

223
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,800
was very young at that time

224
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,800
so you see all of them

225
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,800
Chairs made no matter what people wear

226
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,400
if you can see clearly

227
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,000
next to the house or something

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,200
It's exactly the same as Han bamboo

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,000
It is no different from Han bamboo in western Sichuan

230
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,800
This place is the westernmost Xiaoxingou

231
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I do a lot of research here

232
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
Gun bamboo here

233
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
This is exactly the same as the Tibetan bamboo next to it

234
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,200
So in the middle is a little bit of excessive past

235
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,800
so this is a

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
So among the ethnic minorities in mainland China

237
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,000
It is a very strange nation

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
if we think of it as a nation

239
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,300
so you look at its environment

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,200
Where they live is high mountains and deep valleys

241
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,400
this is a ditch

242
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,900
It is a small tributary of the Min River

243
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,800
people

244
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Look here is a village

245
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,300
This is Shanlonggou

246
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,600
The location of this village is very high

247
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,800
so when you get here

248
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,600
you can't help but wonder

249
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,600
In other words, why do people live here?

250
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,300
In fact, the simplest reason

251
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,800
just for safety

252
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,000
pursue this

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,200
see you later

254
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,600
what about their lives here

255
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
They are plural to exploit a valley

256
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,000
vertical

257
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,300
From this farm next to my home

258
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,900
To this place where wool cattle are raised on the mountain

259
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And then hunt the young ones will go out to hunt in the winter

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Everyone, look at this photo and you can see it again

261
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Their hairy cattle are almost like bison

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Look here we brought a dog up here

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So the leading bull comes to the dog

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then the young bulls count as a circle

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Keep the cow and calf behind

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
This is the habit is exactly the same as that

267
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
like the buffalo you saw in yerston

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
this is their home

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
This is Xiaoxingou Aiqi Village

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
farmland near their home

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is their Jianjun mushroom on the mountain

272
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Basically you occupy that little ditch

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Probably life without fish

274
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But resources are very tight

275
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Every resource boundary here is very important

276
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,300
so you see from this picture you can tell

277
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,800
Their tense relationship over this competition for resources

278
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
This is the black tiger

279
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,600
That black tiger is here you see it's built on a ridge

280
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,300
There are very oblique fights on both sides

281
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Then this ridge was covered with some

282
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,800
Everyone looks like a chimney thing

283
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,200
that's not a chimney

284
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,000
That's a defensive tower

285
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,200
So you look at Chinese literature

286
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,300
It is said that the black tiger gun was overturned in the Ming and Qing dynasties

287
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
is famously brutal

288
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,600
So wait a minute and I'll repeat

289
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
emphasize this to everyone

290
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,800
Documentation you have seen

291
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,000
even the world you see

292
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,500
all other appearances

293
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,400
it's all a representation

294
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,700
What is the original image behind it?

295
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,600
as you can see in this picture

296
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
That is, the competition for resources is very fierce.

297
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,200
People are in a very tense state

298
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,700
This is Yonghegou, everyone sees it is the same

299
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,300
The houses are tightly packed together, on the hillside

300
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Min Jiang's Ziliu at the bottom is still at the bottom

301
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
It's also winter time and this farmland is dry

302
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,000
This is Puxigou in Li County, you can see it more clearly

303
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,700
This is a village, all the houses are tightly grouped together

304
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,500
And it's far from the valley below

305
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,700
It takes about 40 minutes to an hour to climb up.

306
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Some villages take two hours to go up

307
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,300
This is where you see them, this is a black tiger

308
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,500
Not that Oxtail Village

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
During Chinese New Year, this is the beginning of the year and they have a ceremony

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
inside a religious ceremony

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
They're young and old with guns

312
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Shooting in the air, around a disused field next to the village

313
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
walk around

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
In fact, they are all expressing

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We are very determined to protect our Siyuan border

316
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This girl wears the same clothes

317
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
now everyone will pay attention

318
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Everywhere these girls dress alike

319
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
then just say

320
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is the national costume tradition of our gun clan

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But for the locals

322
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's not it, similarity doesn't matter

323
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The important thing is the difference between his clothing and that of the village next to him

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Even a small distinction is very important to them

325
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
because in this place

326
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,600
Resource competition and differentiation are important

327
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,100
so this is

328
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,100
back to my field work

329
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,400
Xiaoxinge Aiqi Village, where I live the most

330
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,800
You see, this village is different from the one before

331
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,900
it is scattered

332
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,500
i know them well

333
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
so i joke with them sometimes

334
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,400
once i said

335
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,700
You are so small, why did your house fall apart?

336
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,400
not get together like you

337
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,700
they said yes

338
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,600
we never noticed this

339
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
make sense

340
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,000
I said because you are robbing people

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,200
you were not robbed

342
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,000
They used to be very upstream

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
famous savage

344
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Local within an identity system

345
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
very interesting

346
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
people from every region

347
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,600
In fact, what I call a region is not a very big one.

348
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,000
It's just a small ditch or a section of a small ditch.

349
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,100
The people over there may be just a few children

350
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,200
They call themselves Erma

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
People in the upper reaches are called barbarians

352
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,400
Then the people downstream are those cunning Han Chinese

353
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,400
But the people from that village called Manzi

354
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,500
He also calls himself a horse

355
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,700
Then he called the people below are Han Chinese

356
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,200
On the contrary, you think others are barbarians

357
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,700
Others think you are Han Chinese

358
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,300
He thinks the barbarian is on the root

359
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:28,300
So this is a situation of ethnic identity in the local area

360
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,800
So it's New Year's Eve

361
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
their wedding ceremony

362
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,000
This is also Xiaoxingou Aiqi Village

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
it's winter

364
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
outside their house

365
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,400
Pile up a lot of firewood

366
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,800
inside the house

367
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,200
There are some pig signs hanging on the roof beams

368
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,600
for them

369
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,500
This is the greatest safety in life

370
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,800
Maximum protection

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So we take a look at the history of what they believe

372
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is what the people in the ditch in Egypt said

373
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is what I use to record and divide it into text

374
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He said that the first time there was no one

375
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
three brothers big brother is a woman

376
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
brother here

377
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Another one invited a brother to the Iraqi team

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
My brother said that I can bask in the sun when I live here

379
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So the sun shines early for the three teams

380
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
invite brother a little scared

381
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The second brother said that if you die, you will be buried in my second team.

382
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So a team of dead people are brought here to be buried

383
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
it's such a simple history

384
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that means the people of this place

385
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The relationship between the three in sub

386
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Also this is what another guy told me

387
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
He said that the seven brothers from the top

388
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Some of the seven brothers are in the big ear

389
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
some in pigs ears

390
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's how those wolves fucked your dad

391
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
they are here

392
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What dynasty was fanned

393
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
run here

394
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It turns out that there is no one here

395
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Here are the seven brothers

396
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
You see he later said only three brothers came

397
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,000
Four more brothers are out there

398
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The seven big ears Niba

399
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is how people are divided

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,500
So this one is different from the one just now

401
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,000
story told

402
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That is to say, the three brothers

403
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It turned out to be three of the seven brothers

404
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This is another record

405
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,500
This man also told me

406
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,000
he became nine

407
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,500
He said nine brothers came

408
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
nine brothers stand there

409
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Three brothers started a fire in this ditch

410
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
two brothers over there

411
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So there's an interesting dictation from him later on.

412
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
i read it out

413
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He said the nine brothers were Huang Cao

414
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
he ask me

415
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Qin Dynasty or Huang Cao

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Qin Dynasty three people eight million

417
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,500
Huang Cao three people eight million

418
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,000
I said whatever

419
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
he can't escape

420
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
here it is

421
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,500
A family of little brothers came here

422
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
We know that Qin Dynasty and Huang Cao

423
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,000
one is the people

424
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And the times are far behind

425
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
What does this mean?

426
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
That time means nothing to them.

427
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,200
Their history is a past combined with the present

428
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
In the past few brothers came here

429
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,600
what are we now

430
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
This is a very special kind of history

431
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,300
so everyone see

432
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
I can simplify the first few to this

433
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,800
if you want to explain this side

434
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,600
The origin of the three Zai Ziren

435
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,700
You said once upon a time three brothers came here

436
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700
then go to a place alone

437
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,400
And then you have to explain where this large range of people comes from?

438
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,600
You say that once upon a time seven brothers came here

439
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,500
Then what about everyone?

440
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,100
stand alone in one place

441
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
and then a wider range

442
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,100
This is if you go to Jiuzhaigou to play

443
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,700
take off when the plane lands

444
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
did you see a big mountain

445
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,600
That's called Snowberg Peak

446
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,700
If you ask him, he said that the top mountain of Snow Castle

447
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,000
that plugged in

448
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,900
Where did all the people come from?

449
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,000
He will tell you another

450
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,160
seven brothers story

451
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,960
That is to say, how can these people believe

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,760
Such a strange history, right?

453
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,560
ok i tell you

454
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
to tell everyone is to say

455
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
Why do they believe this history

456
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,960
Egyptian village has three children

457
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,360
one pair two pair three pair

458
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,160
There are more than fifty households

459
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,260
just a small child

460
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,760
One-to-two couples in Yingsan-myeon

461
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,560
That's what I just said

462
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,460
Who said he was a little scared when he died?

463
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,260
He said his brother said

464
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,360
Then you die and bury me here

465
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,460
In fact, the reaction is that these two sons

466
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,760
close relationship

467
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,560
Three pairs in Yangshan-myeon

468
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,960
Yangshan noodles usually we say

469
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,760
This is what the sun shines early in the morning

470
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,960
So production is better

471
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,160
Usually more people

472
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,060
so they just

473
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,960
the story just now

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,660
History says that he was the big brother

475
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,660
admit he's the big brother

476
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,160
But it's a bit derogatory to him

477
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,660
Said big brother because it is a neck

478
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,760
so we let him

479
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
so in this place

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The homes and houses of coal households are all located on the foundation of a specific land god

481
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The name of the land god is also the name of the family

482
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and very consciously

483
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No land God can't build a house

484
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So what is the effect of everyone being so smart?

485
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
in this ravine

486
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If there are 30 households, there will always be 30 households

487
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Forever 50 households

488
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
If there are 50 land gods, there will always be 50 households

489
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Another effect is

490
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm for relatives, it's actually a spatial relationship

491
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Because if you move to another

492
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
For example, a place is vacant

493
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
There is a father who has many sons

494
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He can't help living at home is difficult

495
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He can get the consent of other people in Murakami

496
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Said my son was going to take that place

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
build a house over there

498
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If everyone in the village agrees

499
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Then his son will set up a household there

500
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Then the father and the son will become

501
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
into a different family

502
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
because of that son

503
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
he is the inherited family

504
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The wound of the land god

505
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
so think about it

506
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What does it mean to live in the historical construction

507
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
In social reality

508
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That is to say, today a person of the second race

509
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
he went hunting

510
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
he chased a camphor

511
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
one way

512
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
When chasing to the edge of the clan's territory

513
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
he stopped suddenly

514
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
in his heart

515
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
because that history told him

516
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
This is not the land of our ancestors

517
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And their ancestors were brothers to mine

518
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
so if today i

519
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
words that cross the line

520
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
it will break the brotherhood

521
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
so he stopped

522
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
so think about it

523
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
people live in this history

524
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Your actions and actions all prove this history

525
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
so maybe this time

526
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
another one

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
people of that clan

528
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Will watch super super super

529
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
not crossing the line

530
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,460
Then he sees you cross the line

531
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:02,960
good

532
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,800
You are still my good brother

533
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,500
What if at this time

534
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,000
They heard a whistling in the distance

535
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
he knows

536
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
there is a side

537
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,500
people with big ear ditches maybe

538
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,800
come over here to hunt frog waist

539
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,200
and then everyone

540
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,000
I have to go there to drive people away

541
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
why

542
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,500
because history tells them

543
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,200
Our ancestors were three brothers

544
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,500
brothers are cooperative

545
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,000
so what

546
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Cooperation distinguishes confrontation

547
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
in this history

548
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,500
a very important narrative symbol

549
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
is brother

550
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,000
his three metaphors

551
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,500
it's brother

552
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,300
is cooperative

553
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,800
Because brothers are born of the same father

554
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
and what about brother

555
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,700
It's another brother's name

556
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,500
Brothers of all kinds

557
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,000
and brother

558
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,100
There will always be some small contradictions

559
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,000
forever in this little struggle

560
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,200
So people live in historically constructed

561
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
this social phenomenon

562
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,100
And then the social reality is so real

563
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,700
Because every action of yours is confirming this history

564
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,800
People naturally believe and care about this history

565
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,120
So in this place apart from the history

566
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,180
wait a minute if you have time you can talk

567
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,480
their Trinity disc belief

568
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,320
all guide and tell them what to do

569
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,620
A person's actions follow these

570
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,760
What we call history and culture and religion

571
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,600
So this history is actually the same as our history

572
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,900
seems to have a lot of details

573
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,980
There are also some small details in their history.

574
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,080
These details also differentiate this group of people

575
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,900
This detail is sometimes too simple to tell.

576
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,740
It is often said that when the three brothers separated

577
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,260
they kill a cow

578
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,100
One for the head, one for the tail and one for the body

579
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,900
or when three brothers separated

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,560
One to one who seems like they say metal

581
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,400
a man made of gold

582
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,200
One is the silver man

583
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,400
Iron Man

584
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,600
and then something like this

585
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,800
it's that simple

586
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,000
So they usually yell and yell

587
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,800
Like the Yonghegou side

588
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,900
Who is the descendant of Niu Pizi?

589
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,200
who is the offspring of oxtail

590
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
Of course, a cowhide oxtail

591
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
it must be a comparison

592
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,000
The relatively weaker this, this, and this Zaizi

593
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,600
What about Beichuan Inner and Outer Ditch?

594
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
This place is more Chinese

595
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,200
So you see they have Chinese surnames

596
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,800
Zhang exiled three surnames to Xiaoba

597
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,400
come three brothers

598
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
So it is impossible for the three brothers to intermarry

599
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
So I changed my last name

600
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Then they said that a person stood in a ditch

601
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
One is Sanshulin

602
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,400
That's Liu's

603
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,500
The other is the inner and outer grooves

604
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,000
It was a farm

605
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,700
In fact, there is a big controversy

606
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,300
Now say it's Wang's

607
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,000
So some oral histories like this

608
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
Actually very inspiring to me

609
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,700
Indicates that history is often changed in such disputes

610
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,100
So the belief in the three gods in the ditch of Egypt is the same

611
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,700
Each of the three carriers has its own territory

612
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,200
So they banded together to protect their common turf

613
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,800
So the three gods are also used to emphasize this kind of human ecology

614
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,700
Simply put, each carrier has its own three gods

615
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,000
Then combine if the three carriers have a groove

616
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,600
The three of them together have a bigger three gods

617
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,400
So the biggest three gods in this place are Coronado

618
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,000
This is the symbol of the three gods

619
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,200
a sign on the hill

620
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,000
So when I run up the hills with these friends who live with guns

621
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
When you come across a sign like this

622
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,500
we're going to walk around

623
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,580
less numbers plugged in to show worship

624
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,880
This means that

625
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,440
I respect other people's territory boundaries

626
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,060
The location of the three gods is usually the boundary of the territory

627
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,400
ok let's see now

628
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,220
Jialong Tibetan

629
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,560
what they call history

630
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,680
So let me briefly introduce

631
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,480
Everyone knows the location

632
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,520
its environment of production

633
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,340
Very similar to the neighbor's gun family

634
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,640
It also has a similar tritheistic belief

635
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,920
That is to say, it is the same here

636
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,440
that is

637
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,720
As long as there is faith in the three gods

638
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,240
Everyone pays great attention to the land

639
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,560
Then also have this

640
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,140
No house can be built where there is no site god

641
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,420
this custom

642
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,040
But in the homes of ordinary people here

643
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,080
I can not find

644
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,380
I can't interview people like this

645
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,880
History of the Dixiong's Ancestors

646
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Then this kind of history only exists in the beliefs of the various Tushi families in the past

647
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,500
Sorry, I'm here to explain to you

648
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,200
I forgot to say first

649
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,500
In fact, the situation I am talking about

650
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,300
mostly before the 1950s

651
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,300
At most, this situation lasted until 1960 and 70

652
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,700
Later, because after the so-called liberation of mainland China

653
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,500
there is a big change

654
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,700
So this is what it used to be

655
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,700
In the past, this place was governed by various chieftains

656
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,200
They all usually refer to people from all over the world by the name of Tusi

657
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Such as this Badi, Bawang, Zaku, Droth family

658
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,900
Then each chieftain led probably a dozen to dozens of villages

659
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
and very important

660
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,700
They are different from Gunru

661
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,900
they are very religious

662
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Followers of Tibetan Buddhism

663
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,360
You see, the river next to it is the Dadu River

664
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,440
this is a village

665
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,840
This village came out of this ravine

666
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,160
This little bit of alluvial soil is filled and cultivated here

667
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,360
So the location of this village

668
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,600
it's about the place

669
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,320
This is not the same as the gun bamboo

670
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,520
Qiangzhu would never dare to build a village so close to the river

671
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,360
On the one hand, I am afraid of flooding, on the other hand, I am also afraid of being forced

672
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,600
This is the village of Merlo

673
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
This is one of my field points

674
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,120
Wait a minute, everyone can see

675
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,440
this is also a

676
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,160
The house and the form of the settlement are also a sign

677
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,480
wait a minute you look at this and that

678
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,160
Wait a minute I'm showing you this

679
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,000
The House of Liang Fan Yi Family

680
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,400
very different

681
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Simply put, you can see that this house is very delicate

682
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,600
Because its house is built on the site rope

683
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,000
So once you cover it and live there, it will last a long time.

684
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,200
not easy to move

685
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,600
So their house is very particular

686
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,000
This is also the year when I went to take pictures for their wedding

687
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,600
so this kind of wedding

688
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,600
This is called Qilu Village

689
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,400
Go to Morle Village and bring this girl back

690
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,000
This kind of wedding is where the whole village attends

691
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The whole village will stay in Moerle Village for one night

692
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The next day the girl bid farewell to the elder

693
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Then go to her husband's village

694
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So this place is also famous as the Valley of Beauty

695
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Look at this, it's really beautiful

696
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,500
But this actually shows another

697
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,300
Phenomena unrelated to my research

698
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,600
I just told you

699
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,800
Diversity can be found here in every discipline

700
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,300
This is one of the genetic diversity

701
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,600
That is to say, some genes happen to be concentrated in this place

702
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,500
Let me tell you this village is called Badi Village

703
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,700
There are more than a dozen villages here in Badi

704
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,400
people are beautiful

705
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,600
There is also a Meinan Valley

706
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,300
If you are interested, you can ask me

707
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,600
It's even weirder if you look at the history here.

708
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,200
But this history is from the 1930s to the turn of the 40s when

709
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,000
An early anthropologist Mr. Ma Changshou

710
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
he is collected

711
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,600
He said that the lion of the barren valley has a giant bird to meet the poor

712
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,100
born in poor cloth

713
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
This is the name of the virtue of poor cloth

714
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,400
He is called Lord of the Poor Birds

715
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
the bird laid five eggs

716
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,000
One red one green one white one black one flower

717
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,800
A person came out of the flower egg

718
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,400
Bear hand life, eye descendants

719
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,300
Taining

720
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,200
This Taining is Bamei

721
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
just when he was near a

722
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,800
A small center of a Tibetan Buddhist

723
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,100
lead to the bottom

724
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,200
Then on the eight bottom side

725
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,300
He gave birth to two brothers

726
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,800
It's just these two people who will become apprentices with all kinds of prosperity

727
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,300
take a look

728
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,900
There is an extra symbol of this poor bird on it

729
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,200
right

730
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,600
This is what is said in Tibetan Buddhism

731
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,300
a garuda

732
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,800
Garuda

733
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,500
Read this story below

734
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,800
still a brother story at the end

735
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,600
use a brother story

736
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,700
To show the ancestral relationship of the two apprentices

737
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,300
This is also collected by Mr. Ma Changshou

738
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,200
Ge Se Zhan Tushi's ancestors in his family

739
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,100
He said that our ancestors were brought from the poor Ministry of 39

740
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,900
The poor actually refers to

741
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,200
Just like Lhasa

742
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
He said that this has been here for three, four or five generations.

743
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
When I came here, there were four brothers

744
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You see the same poor bird symbol

745
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Then there are four brothers

746
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
another brother story

747
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So this is the ancestor of another Zhuoshijia toast

748
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
also the same

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Every one of these toasts tells a story about their ancestors

750
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's all like a pattern

751
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
follow this pattern

752
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
so why do they care about history like this

753
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
very simple

754
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's the toast family

755
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
their divinity and ruling authority

756
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It is from this history

757
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
In addition, the relationship between the toast and the adjacent toast

758
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
It is shown in the brother's story below

759
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
he thinks more

760
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The more he thinks that toast and I are brothers

761
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
means

762
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,700
friend and foe

763
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,200
It's the closer the relationship

764
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,200
The most I do in the field is to look at the bottom and the bottom

765
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,900
These two places are

766
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,400
that's what the relationship is like

767
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,300
And the language of the two places is completely different

768
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,100
They know each other's language is full of curse words

769
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,600
They've heard each other talk since they were kids

770
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,500
He came back and asked his parents

771
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,300
The people on the other side of the river called me or something

772
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,100
what is that

773
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,300
So all he learns is swearing

774
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
so there is

775
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,300
It is the core area of ​​local Tibetan Buddhism

776
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,100
It native and Tibetan Buddha

777
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,700
It is to admit that one is a Tibetan Buddhist

778
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,700
we are the edge

779
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,700
all core

780
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,900
So I also collected here

781
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,900
very interesting

782
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,900
There is a special family called the Vastus

783
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:56,800
At the exact epicenter of the 2008 Great Western Sichuan Earthquake

784
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,000
right here

785
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,840
I have collected and seen three versions here

786
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,340
Three brothers in the same family

787
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,700
Actually told the history of three different pairs of families

788
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,040
The first one is what the family tree of Tusi said

789
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,840
It's mainly about one of their ancestors

790
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,080
be a hero

791
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,840
From Ushizang is from Lhasa

792
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,440
Then come to replace China's poverty

793
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,540
So China gave him Xuanwei envoy

794
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,000
Then just manage the natives here

795
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,840
The story is that the chieftain's younger brother

796
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,700
Usually the chieftain's younger brother is the main local lama

797
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,340
This lama told the story of their family

798
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,840
You see, it's the same as the previous one again

799
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
The big bird in the sky laid a few more eggs

800
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,140
Then how does this egg go?

801
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,640
which toast

802
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,940
This is another brother of a chieftain

803
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,540
This brother, he talked about it again and again.

804
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,840
It is said that Henan people have a Three Kingdoms

805
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,380
what brought four people

806
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
A son immigrated to Sichuan

807
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
one to one

808
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
One to Jintang Peng Xian generation

809
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
there is one more here

810
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
there's one more back

811
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Returning to Yuanji means returning to Henan

812
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So you see this becomes a bro story again

813
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
right

814
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
what's going on

815
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Actually

816
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Because of this I feel that this history

817
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
really very strange

818
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that's what i'm talking about

819
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
they happen to be caught in

820
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Between the two forces of Han and Tibetan

821
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
So he is in the same family

822
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Where are the three brothers?

823
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
They care about different histories

824
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
that big brother is toast

825
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Of course he cares about the first version

826
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Because that can prove his identity as a toast

827
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
right

828
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The second brother is a lama

829
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
He believes in the kind of divinity

830
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
he and each toast

831
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
family relationship

832
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
this old

833
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
where is this toast

834
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
He's talking about a local culture

835
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
special culture

836
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,000
How do you think about history?

837
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,300
all brothers

838
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,900
At first it was a few brothers

839
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:09,900
good

840
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,700
Finally, I want to talk about this Liangshan survivor

841
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,600
look

842
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,500
His population is different from before

843
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
Of course, the Liangshan area is relatively large

844
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,300
bigger than the previous ones

845
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,700
But more people

846
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,500
23.06 million

847
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,800
In addition to the Jiaotong University basin,

848
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,500
His environment is similar to that of the Sichuan-Tibetan Qiang people

849
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,600
He is a part-time farmer and logger

850
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
These are similar to the Tibetan accent

851
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,800
But the biggest difference is his sociality

852
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,700
his this

853
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,300
he

854
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,000
Let me just say it here

855
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,800
He doesn't have the belief in the three gods of the Tibetan people

856
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,800
But he has a wealth of skill combined with blood

857
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,900
This is something Tibetans don't have

858
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,900
So everyone, think about Tibetan accents

859
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,800
the kind of history we just talked about

860
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,300
There is only one past combined with the present

861
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,900
if the family history

862
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,100
Almost only three generations at most

863
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,400
I don't remember any further

864
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,700
Then the structure of their house is very simple

865
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
And do not pay attention to the site

866
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,500
They don't even like to build houses on old machines

867
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,200
They love to move around

868
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,500
and very important

869
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,100
He has rulers and ruled

870
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,500
A Consecutive Total Information Society

871
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,300
So of course this is over

872
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,500
But his traces are still there

873
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,000
They are divided into rulers are black chairs

874
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,300
The white chair is the subordinate farmer

875
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,500
Then there are two other classes behind are slaves

876
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,900
Both the black chair and the white chair have family property

877
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,400
Everyone belongs to his family property

878
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,000
Concentration of black chair family property residence

879
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The white chair family property is because of him

880
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,680
it belongs to each black chair

881
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,020
so they are difficult to unite

882
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,200
this is how it used to be

883
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,480
look at this house

884
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,800
this house is abandoned

885
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,000
So their houses are built very simply

886
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,800
If you want to move, just throw it away.

887
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,900
Look here and that too

888
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,200
this is the house over there

889
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:20,900
the village

890
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,200
in this village

891
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,400
everywhere you can see

892
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
These formerly abandoned houses

893
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Because they don't like building on old foundations

894
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,200
This may also be obsolete

895
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,600
This is where people live

896
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,100
The house is very

897
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,600
compared to the front

898
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,800
very simple

899
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,800
These two are white chairs

900
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,500
this is the black chair

901
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,400
this is his grandmother

902
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,600
let's visit him

903
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,800
Then

904
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,600
I tell a few stories about this little boy

905
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,400
that

906
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,140
This kind of historical memory in their home can best illustrate

907
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,680
this kind of

908
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,740
Because when he took me around to visit

909
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,320
Often I hear someone ask him

910
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,160
Are you the kid who burned down the house?

911
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,280
I listened to it a few times and came back one night when we were chatting

912
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,080
I'll just say what great things you did as a kid

913
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,620
people remember you

914
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,900
he was very embarrassed

915
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,260
Said I was playing with fire in the back of the house once when my dad called me

916
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,320
Burn the whole village in half

917
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,140
Say this, this, this, his father, this

918
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,240
The sheep are all sold and there is nothing to do with them

919
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,580
So let's take him and everyone to think about this scene that looks very touching.

920
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,660
A father with a six-year-old child

921
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,500
Mountains everywhere in Liangshan Prefecture began to be called home

922
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,820
Everyone knows that the name of this family is to remember which family I belong to

923
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,820
what is our family history

924
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,100
You can read each other

925
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,200
You'll know how close you are to me

926
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,600
Nearly pay 100 yuan

927
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,200
20 yuan for a little farther

928
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
probably like this

929
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,600
Said it took more than half a year

930
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,600
Lost all others

931
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,200
this is for me

932
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,800
that is to say I heard him say

933
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
on the one hand very touched

934
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,200
On the one hand it is a very special experience

935
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,000
why?

936
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,400
in Tibetan area

937
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
there will never be such a thing

938
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,400
Because it's common for houses to burn down here

939
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,200
But except for the native people in the Tibetan area

940
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,800
listen to you build the house

941
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,800
How can you possibly seek help from outsiders?

942
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,400
This is where the survivors are very powerful in the local area.

943
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,200
Also from another point of view

944
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,000
In the past, it was also a place where the survivors were considered very barbaric.

945
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,200
Why?

946
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,800
The bereaved are different from the Tibetan

947
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,800
They dare to go out to open up wasteland and conquer the world

948
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,000
By what?

949
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,200
historical memory

950
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,000
plus historical memory

951
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,600
So some Tibetans next to me know

952
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,800
if you watch some survivors

953
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,700
Two or three households have invaded your territory

954
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,600
no one lives next to your mountain

955
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,300
One day it suddenly started to smoke

956
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,400
A few bereaved families came over there

957
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,500
then you don't mess with him

958
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Because although there are two or three families

959
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,000
He randomly finds hundreds of people to help fight

960
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,100
Easy

961
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,200
Why?

962
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,900
It is by this combined with diachronic memory

963
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,800
so here

964
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,600
In the entire Sichuan border area

965
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,100
pineapple seed dill

966
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,600
are all in

967
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,500
already in Sichuan dialect

968
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,100
scold strong and unreasonable people

969
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,200
What does it mean?

970
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,300
This is what it meant

971
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,800
The people from this side of Liangshan

972
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,300
so i just said

973
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,500
My friend from the field is in Ezi Village, Xiaoxin Country

974
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,600
They are also called pineapple seeds

975
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,900
Actually they are not pineapple seeds

976
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,000
they are

977
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Because of being barbaric, I was scolded for stripping naked

978
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
Then other people's impression of them is

979
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,960
Very able to mobilize people who increase capital to help fight

980
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,960
They are feared by all ethnic groups in this place

981
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:17,860
then what about them

982
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,360
Each capital increase has its own family allowance

983
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,360
That is the name of men from generation to generation

984
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,560
joint father and son

985
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,760
For example, he said that you see and hold the cloth

986
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:32,260
Take the cloth, take the insert, take the ink

987
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,860
He even developed a way of changing memory

988
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,500
so many important wars

989
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,700
Both Qianxi and ancestors are recorded in this kind of history

990
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,460
This is me from a visit to a person

991
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,860
He wrote a book called "I Am Between Ghosts and Gods"

992
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,160
i visit his son

993
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,560
his son wrote it with him

994
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,600
He tells the history of their immediate family

995
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,760
There are stories of brothers in this history

996
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,000
But it's different from the gun bamboo

997
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,260
He all started with hero ancestors

998
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,960
It all started with some heroic ancestors

999
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,900
This is the score of the repertoire

1000
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,700
you see the same

1001
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,400
Both father and son

1002
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,400
This is a big death

1003
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,560
So why do you want to remember the history of the family?

1004
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,860
Because of the families in black they often have wars

1005
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,820
I'm talking about the human ecology here

1006
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,120
It has something to do with the large population here

1007
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,860
Many of them are wars between yin relatives

1008
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,320
Extraordinary

1009
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,320
Those who were defeated moved away

1010
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,320
So you remember the history of these old and new feuds

1011
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,920
Can help people in the family to leave the same enemy

1012
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,460
Then for the survivors who love to sign

1013
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,220
Living through the history of the home

1014
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,880
can be found far away

1015
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That is, members of the family who help fight and borrow money

1016
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,600
Listen to what they say about women in general

1017
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,200
It is not necessary to be home

1018
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,600
usually male

1019
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,200
But I also see some women who memorize their backs very well

1020
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,500
It was the young man just now

1021
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,000
Once I went to a village with him

1022
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,600
He ended up being crippled by a drunk old lady

1023
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,200
been talking for more than half an hour

1024
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,200
Then the old lady let him go

1025
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,600
I just watched him pay the old lady five dollars

1026
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,000
I said what's going on

1027
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,600
He said, oops, that old lady carried her home away from me.

1028
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,000
I recited the last time when she was my aunt

1029
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,600
I pay five dollars

1030
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,600
asked me to give him five bucks for a drink

1031
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,800
So it's useful to look at the history

1032
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,000
this

1033
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,200
so let's take a look

1034
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,200
These histories of the three ethnic groups we just looked at

1035
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
and finally

1036
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,460
I noticed that for nearly a hundred years

1037
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,120
At least that is if we don't know the earlier history

1038
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,140
very clear

1039
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,460
The distribution area of ​​the survivors has been expanding

1040
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,540
It has something to do with it and the machine

1041
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,860
So this guy who lets us read history

1042
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,380
to think about a problem

1043
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,460
That is to say, are we humans the earliest

1044
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,020
live in a society like the stick gun

1045
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,060
And history begins

1046
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,880
Create more complex and larger societies

1047
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,440
start to expand

1048
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,560
So we look inside the history

1049
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,400
In fact, there are real and fictional stories

1050
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,680
the most important is

1051
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,760
Let's look at it and see what kinds of their local history

1052
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,280
in this historical narrative

1053
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,620
often follow a certain structure

1054
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,660
Like the structure of the brothers we talked about

1055
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,760
What kind of structure is there like a big bird?

1056
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,780
we can ask

1057
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,360
Is it because the stick guns and their culture were relatively backward in the past?

1058
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,080
So they remember and uncle's

1059
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
history is not true

1060
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and looking for some narrative structure

1061
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Then don't we?

1062
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
not actually

1063
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I later wrote a book

1064
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
It's called "Heroic Ancestors and Brotherly Nation"

1065
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,000
is to analyze all those in Chinese history

1066
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
History from the Emperor

1067
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
actually i found

1068
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
history as we know it

1069
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Also looking for a narrative mode

1070
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
History relative to sibling ancestors

1071
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
what we know

1072
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
is a heroic ancestral history

1073
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
These are two different histories

1074
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
new product

1075
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Emerging history I mean a social culture

1076
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
it makes us unknowingly

1077
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
just looking for a certain pattern

1078
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
to remember and write history

1079
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So look at this example I gave

1080
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
This is very famous in Chinese history

1081
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
many historians

1082
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I always thought it was the real word

1083
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
A Heroic Ancestor in the Northeast

1084
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,560
Ji Zi, Prince of Yin, Runs to North Korea

1085
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,520
Be a hero to civilize the Korean people

1086
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,480
prince of a southeastern state

1087
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,560
run from here to here

1088
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,200
enlightened

1089
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,720
The heroic ancestors of the present Nanjing and Shanghai generations

1090
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,600
A general of the state of Chu ran from here to here

1091
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,560
becomes a conquest

1092
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,400
Kingdom

1093
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,600
become king here

1094
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,520
To the northwest, Tao Nutao of Qin State came here

1095
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,880
The locals regard Tao as the king

1096
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,840
think about it

1097
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,240
this history

1098
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,520
Is there any structure

1099
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,840
is there a pattern

1100
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,040
The first one has the pattern

1101
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,440
all a hero

1102
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,600
and all failed

1103
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,280
frustrated hero

1104
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
right

1105
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,000
Then if we know later

1106
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,240
actually you see

1107
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,760
It is actually the symbol of these heroes

1108
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,680
It corresponds to the Central Plains Huaxia at that time

1109
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,120
these are the histories

1110
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,520
both appear in probably

1111
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,040
Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD

1112
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
In Shiji Hanshu and later Hanshu these

1113
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,600
in these records

1114
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,700
So it actually represents

1115
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,600
Zhongyuan Huaxia's thoughts on the Quartet crowd

1116
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,700
Simply speaking

1117
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,100
Zhongyuan Huaxia hopes that people on both sides

1118
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,800
is part of Huaxia

1119
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,900
So give them two more distinguished ancestors

1120
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,300
see if you want to accept

1121
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,000
southwest a little hesitant

1122
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,800
Give him a general of Chu

1123
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,900
to this northwest

1124
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,300
That's Tao Nu

1125
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,800
that's even worse

1126
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,200
so you see

1127
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,000
then this

1128
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,300
Do you mean history?

1129
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,200
Do you care about this history?

1130
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,000
Koreans now care about the history of the machine very much

1131
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,100
so it's still fighting

1132
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,900
since the twelfth century

1133
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,300
People on the Korean peninsula are very concerned about the history of the machine

1134
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,700
since modern times

1135
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,900
They have two discourses

1136
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,500
First

1137
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,700
machine is myth

1138
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,200
wrong

1139
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,300
That's fine, just ignore him

1140
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,300
The second argument is that

1141
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,700
The machine is actually our Korean

1142
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,400
In fact, the original territory

1143
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,000
In the current Chinese train

1144
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So Jilin Province belongs to our Korea

1145
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
This must be controversial, right?

1146
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
how to explain history

1147
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
There is no dispute about Southeast

1148
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Everyone believes that people in Jiangnan really believe in the history of Taibo Benwu

1149
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
So you can still see the Taibo Temple when you go there

1150
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
There are Taibo Temples in many places

1151
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Southwest from Four Seasons

1152
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
The four seasons of Zhuangqiao are written in all the square characters of Yunnan

1153
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Northwest they don't care

1154
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I don't care what you say I am

1155
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
He doesn't care about this history of ignorance and foresight

1156
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So everyone pay attention to what I want to say

1157
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The content of history may have truth

1158
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
But the main fiction lies in the relationship between history and the human rights in power

1159
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
In other words, why do Koreans care about the machine?

1160
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
He thinks it seems that the machine has something to do with the current people in Korea

1161
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
In fact, no matter whether this history is true or not

1162
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,100
The biggest fiction lies in these characters in history

1163
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,700
Whether it's a brother or a hero

1164
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,400
relationship with present

1165
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,800
that is a very big fiction

1166
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Let's see

1167
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,200
Creation and belief in the history of our brethren's ancestors

1168
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,800
The existence of this kind of gun bamboo

1169
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,700
Everyone I didn't talk about here

1170
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,000
you can notice

1171
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
What is so special about this history?

1172
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,100
this history because it is a past

1173
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,400
then combine with now

1174
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,200
So in this history

1175
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,300
The reality created by that history is

1176
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,500
There is no distinction between conquerors and conquered

1177
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,700
There is no distinction between old residents and new residents

1178
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,100
But the history of such heroic ancestors as we believe

1179
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,400
I can say

1180
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,700
The so-called we are the whole world

1181
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,600
people of the so-called civilized world

1182
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,400
This is the hero we believe in

1183
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,500
Whether it's the emperor, Tan Jun, Chen Jinsihan, Abraham

1184
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,460
What about the history of the holding group?

1185
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:05,920
or Immigrant Heroes to the present May issue

1186
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,860
and the American history of the heroes who founded the country and unblocked the black slaves

1187
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,200
and emphasizing the history of Taiwan's history of the heroic attacks on the Policy Workers Awards

1188
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,960
They are all the products of a kind of heroic history.

1189
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,460
arises out of the above internal group distinction

1190
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,600
there are conquerors

1191
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,300
you just have to believe the history

1192
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:29,260
Now there is a distinction between the conqueror and the conquered

1193
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,960
There is a distinction between old residents and new immigrants

1194
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,960
So actually do you think

1195
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,160
What is the difference between those of us and those of the powerful or the Tibetans?

1196
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,960
same structure

1197
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,660
And what?

1198
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,860
Where is the same biggest fiction?

1199
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,060
It's the relationship between the hero and the crowd

1200
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,660
like in the US

1201
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,260
often the mayflower immigrant

1202
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,260
It seems to be related to all the days

1203
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,060
How could it be

1204
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:56,960
right

1205
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,160
In Taiwan, it seems that all the people from other provinces will tell you

1206
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,100
Anti-China is related

1207
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,100
All Hokkien people will be related to Zheng Chenggong

1208
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,040
Actually not

1209
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,440
right

1210
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,200
Those are all some imaginations generated through this kind of history

1211
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,800
So even if the heroic epic is true

1212
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,600
whatever those machines

1213
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,700
even if it's true

1214
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,800
He and the current group

1215
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,200
For example, the relationship between the emperor and the Han people

1216
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,300
are imagined and constructed

1217
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,300
so

1218
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:34,300
Finally I'm going to use this to illustrate my entire point above

1219
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,300
It's like the movie Matrix

1220
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,300
the metrics

1221
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,300
inside the plot

1222
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,300
that plot is

1223
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:46,300
At that time, most people lived in the virtual world created by the computer city

1224
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,300
In fact, we are living in the real world constructed by history.

1225
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,300
And we get a certain identity in this world

1226
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,300
we're sending a memory

1227
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,460
So because we believe in history

1228
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:06,460
Accepting one's social status on the fringes

1229
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,660
Like a person stepping on a sharp stone with bare feet

1230
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,660
don't know pain

1231
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,660
There is no movement of pulling the foot back

1232
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,660
Or because we believe in and care about history

1233
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,160
we have something as

1234
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,660
result of what we did

1235
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,460
create an appearance

1236
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,460
And let the world created by history

1237
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,120
become more real

1238
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,420
so then

1239
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,420
How can we know the reality of the real world

1240
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,620
How do you realize the meaning of your actions?

1241
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:46,120
I've been advocating a kind of reflective historiography research lately

1242
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,620
But mostly these are used in

1243
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,920
research on ethnic minorities in China

1244
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,620
Actually my example just now

1245
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,920
the one i lifted

1246
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,120
also some ethnic minorities

1247
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,620
Let's say you accept a history

1248
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,620
This history makes you a minority

1249
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,200
Do you think I'm a minority?

1250
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:02,700
right?

1251
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,860
All your deeds have proved

1252
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:13,200
Your marginalization of this minority in the mainstream society

1253
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,900
more and more solid, more and more real

1254
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,300
you'll always be on the edge

1255
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:24,500
So the reflective historiography I advocate

1256
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,500
It is hoped that through some concepts and research methods

1257
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,800
Let's not just be historians

1258
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:34,700
I also hope that individuals in general will be able to reflect on our pre-existing historical knowledge

1259
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,100
to unearth some of the cognitive biases lurking in our minds

1260
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:44,200
To understand the various social and cultural structures that influence our perception and construction of history

1261
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,600
In this way, our understanding of the reality of society and its historical changes

1262
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,000
may have further understanding

1263
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,500
Thus there may be some reflective action

1264
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,200
I want to create reflective knowledge

1265
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,100
reflective cognition

1266
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,400
and individuals capable of reflective action

1267
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,400
Even if these actions are very small

1268
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,400
can also gradually change the society

1269
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,400
thank you guys i will stop here today

1270
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
it doesn't matter

1271
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Thank you teacher for your wonderful speech

1272
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
i want to ask

1273
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Suppose we learn according to reflection

1274
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Try to think about yourself or your society

1275
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
How do I know if we all or myself

1276
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
will get closer to the truth

1277
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Or do I jump from one surface appearance to another

1278
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I use an example from my book

1279
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,500
A research method I suggest

1280
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,000
In fact, this research method is also related to my multi-point fields.

1281
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,000
That is, if we take that history as a representation

1282
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
That means I'm at Icgo's place

1283
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I observe their social reality

1284
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I believe I'm not seeing the real image

1285
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That said I have a lot of my biases

1286
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
then I record their history

1287
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
that's a sign

1288
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
what is this like

1289
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I watch it with an Out of the Mirror

1290
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
if i put my watch on the table

1291
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
If I look at this watch with an Out of the Mirror

1292
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Then all I saw was some of this Out of the Mirror

1293
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
distorted some shapes

1294
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Then how can I get a better understanding

1295
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
The way I suggest is to move this Out of the Mirror

1296
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
you move the angle of observation

1297
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
or move it to see another object

1298
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Then watch the change of its appearance

1299
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Actually this is my field

1300
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I look everywhere

1301
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
The image of society in every place

1302
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
But I'm not sure if my observation is right or wrong

1303
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But I record these their histories

1304
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
or some myths and legends

1305
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I take these as appearances

1306
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Then I went to compare the changes in this appearance

1307
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Then this time actually this

1308
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I can't stress enough that

1309
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
This approach does not allow us

1310
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Absolutely understand the underlying phenomenon

1311
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But it can teach us about our biases

1312
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That is the nature of this concave-convex mirror

1313
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Is this a concave mirror or a convex mirror?

1314
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I think this explanation should be ok

1315
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Thanks

1316
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Thanks

1317
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,680
He said it was devil's beer

1318
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,680
don't drink

1319
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,680
don't drink

1320
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,800
then i'll be fine

1321
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,320
I went to buy Taiwan beer for him to drink

1322
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,280
Then just talk and start talking

1323
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,160
They came from Harbin in the northeast

1324
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,240
about the third century

1325
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,880
also said education

1326
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,400
They still call the Japanese devils

1327
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,640
Here is an example

1328
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,360
The second example is my brother in Shanghai

1329
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,480
he has a daughter

1330
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,960
I am ten years old and studying in Shanghai

1331
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,960
He needs a red scarf when he goes to school

1332
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,120
he told him honestly

1333
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,120
This red scarf was

1334
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,680
When the Japanese killed us Chinese

1335
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,480
Write the bonus of feelings first

1336
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,520
we want to remember forever

1337
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,520
This life impresses me deeply

1338
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,360
The relationship between China and Japan is so deep

1339
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,360
They used hatred from childhood

1340
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,080
come to teach how to treat the Japanese

1341
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,920
How will the two succeed after renting

1342
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,800
how come

1343
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,120
He used hatred at such a young age

1344
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,520
What should I do if I recognize this renter?

1345
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,160
No, I saw the National Taiwan University History Hell Professor

1346
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,240
he has an article saying

1347
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,840
Just don't teach history

1348
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,320
Because it's all ideology

1349
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,080
After teaching for a long time, I was right

1350
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:32,640
It's because others don't understand

1351
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,640
we want to hate

1352
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,240
this worries me very much

1353
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,640
Should we study history in the next generation?

1354
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,760
Why do we care

1355
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,080
what did we learn about history

1356
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,440
What we learned about CSI

1357
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,080
It turned out that many of them were not

1358
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,000
not all like this

1359
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,560
I took a lot of big classes

1360
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,680
so i feel distressed

1361
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:53,360
many hours of driving

1362
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,360
come ask the teacher to listen

1363
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,160
Thanks

1364
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,440
I think that's the great challenge we historians face

1365
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,640
This indeed means that between each country

1366
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,840
will emphasize some of these histories

1367
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,840
But at the same time we will forget some history

1368
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:22,040
So sometimes I will suddenly ask some mainland Chinese scholars

1369
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,540
Some questions are like provocation

1370
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,940
I said that a Jiangsu native once killed 800,000 of your Hebei native

1371
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,440
what no one knows

1372
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,940
I said that person's name is Xiang Yu

1373
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:39,940
Xiang Yu once killed that, this, 800,000

1374
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:42,940
that's all

1375
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:46,440
Because people think we're one country now

1376
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,940
right it's not important

1377
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:52,940
In fact, our history has been a little forgotten

1378
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,940
Then I'm thinking about the real history education

1379
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,940
I think my ideal is

1380
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,940
Of course we are still in a certain country

1381
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
We are in Taiwan, or you are in China, right?

1382
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
or every country, so your history

1383
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Still can't go too far beyond the interests of this country

1384
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,000
or something

1385
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
But I feel our little child

1386
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
in senior year

1387
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
For example, in the third year of high school

1388
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
or in college

1389
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
we will have this

1390
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Combining historical memory with some aspects of social science

1391
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Basic courses in this category

1392
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
let him know

1393
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,000
The relationship between his identity and history

1394
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
In this way, I feel that such a person

1395
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
his future

1396
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
There will be some reflective choices

1397
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
rather than exactly this

1398
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
history of nationalism

1399
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
caused by the kind

1400
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
This conflict between nations and nations

1401
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Of course we will also do some

1402
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Like me and Professor Huang Zhijing here

1403
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
we also have cooperation

1404
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Do something like this in Northeast Asia

1405
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
For example, history

1406
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,240
Let's see if we can come up with a historical explanation

1407
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:07,740
Let Korea Japan China Taiwan

1408
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,340
Acceptable by several of our countries

1409
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,240
some northeast asian history

1410
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:16,140
Especially about the so-called Manchuria

1411
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,380
Or the history of this place in the Northeast

1412
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,880
because of the history here

1413
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:24,380
It is related to the plot between several countries

1414
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,580
historical plot

1415
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:32,240
ask the professor

1416
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:35,340
very old history

1417
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,500
But because of the different generations

1418
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,740
Views and hatred of history

1419
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,540
or what seems to keep evolving different views

1420
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,300
Is it the same with the angle?

1421
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,440
Yes, of course that means

1422
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,640
History and our personal

1423
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,840
Actually what I just said

1424
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,440
with our personal identification

1425
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,420
with where we are

1426
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Reality matters

1427
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,400
And often when we write history

1428
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,400
we are influenced by some structures

1429
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,600
For example, I just mentioned a structure called historical emerging

1430
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,800
In fact, there are many

1431
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,600
let me give you an example

1432
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,600
Chinese Fangzi Tradition

1433
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,400
right

1434
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:26,000
When Taiwan was included in the territory of the Qing Empire

1435
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Usually magistrates come here

1436
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
in any frontier area

1437
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
The first and foremost thing is called

1438
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Gather local intellectuals to write square characters

1439
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
when you write square characters

1440
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Note that square characters are a genre

1441
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Genre means that it has a certain structure

1442
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
certain way of writing

1443
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
The genre of square characters naturally allows you to write a

1444
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Suitable square characters

1445
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And then turned Taiwan into a part of the whole big empire

1446
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
This doesn't just happen in Taiwan

1447
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Any Yunnan is the same

1448
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
the way I've been looking for

1449
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It is a very interesting example that I studied before

1450
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
the structure of history

1451
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:10,000
There is a guy from Yunnan who is very interesting

1452
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
He has been very this and this all his life

1453
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
When it's time to indulge

1454
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
When it's time to be an official

1455
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Then teach when it's time to retire

1456
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
As a result, in later years

1457
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
He is in charge of compiling a way of Yunnan

1458
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
As a result, he wrote a method

1459
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's not suitable for square characters

1460
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
The result, the result, everyone knows what the result will be

1461
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Everyone knows this word

1462
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
There is another organizational structure called Fang Zi Bureau

1463
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
it's not his business

1464
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
it's a group of people thing

1465
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
As a result, his way was caught by his colleagues

1466
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
this is not acceptable

1467
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
He left angrily

1468
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
so everyone knows

1469
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Not just square characters

1470
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
will guarantee you a history like square characters

1471
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
right

1472
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
so everyone can

1473
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
To find a certain rule and write it out

1474
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,580
This kind of organizational genre can also guarantee a square character

1475
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:04,240
right

1476
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,580
Then the text of this square character comes out

1477
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,080
proves that place is part of the whole

1478
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,680
that's what tells us

1479
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,580
we write a lot

1480
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,380
are influenced by some of our writing structures

1481
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,220
Our culture

1482
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,580
The impact of our various social organizations

1483
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:23,420
In fact, there is another one that I haven't explained very clearly here.

1484
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,580
is the symbol

1485
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:25,660
Symbolic meaning

1486
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,380
In fact, it was mentioned just now

1487
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,300
like those brethren symbols

1488
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:31,180
pair hero symbol

1489
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:33,140
symbol of a hero

1490
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,380
Like those machines, taber

1491
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,260
And the Jiang Zongzheng we talked about in Taiwan

1492
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,300
Zheng Chenggong

1493
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,060
inside each symbol

1494
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:44,540
They all have some inner connotations in the eyes

1495
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,020
not who it appears to be

1496
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,660
and more meaning

1497
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:51,260
affect our identification

1498
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:52,100
right

1499
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
i will give him to you

1500
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:06,500
I ask you how much

1501
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,800
I think our Chinese history

1502
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,300
because some things are

1503
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,000
every emperor dies

1504
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,500
Only one head can change his name

1505
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,500
you are sure

1506
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,500
If the emperor had not died

1507
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,500
he doesn't know his life

1508
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:25,500
his future behavior is influenced by

1509
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,500
Because you think don't get a quick review

1510
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,500
History should be leveled

1511
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,500
This concept seems to be unique to China.

1512
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
don't understand this

1513
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,500
In addition to that

1514
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,500
same basis

1515
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
form of confirmation

1516
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,500
like until the qing dynasty

1517
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,500
The history of the Ming Dynasty was written by the Qing Dynasty

1518
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:52,500
The Republic of China should write history

1519
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
For example, the history of the Republic of China

1520
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,500
Who is he to write

1521
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
these are some questions

1522
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
In fact, I feel like Guoshu people, the original staff should do this

1523
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,000
He's not doing it now, probably can't do it, can't do it

1524
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
This is what seems to have been done historically

1525
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
is it possible to invite them to come

1526
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I may only be able to answer part of your question, the question about verification

1527
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Confirmation is also a genre like the one I just mentioned

1528
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
It also has a certain format

1529
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And this is very interesting, in my research on reflective history

1530
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
That is to say, my interpretation of some historical texts

1531
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It may be different from the general and traditional interpretation methods

1532
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I'll treat it as one, it'll correspond to a situation

1533
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
That is, there is a corresponding relationship between text and context

1534
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Just under a certain context, you will generate such text

1535
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
that historical text

1536
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,840
If that kind of structural context is like the Central Plains Empire

1537
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,640
it produces a structured text

1538
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,640
That's the proof we're talking about you just mentioned

1539
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,940
So you see that the emergence of the confirmation is in the Qin Han Empire

1540
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:19,240
Right, when China's first unified empire emerged

1541
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,240
it appeared

1542
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:26,440
Then when it comes to Qing History, it can barely become the last proof

1543
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,800
You can see that text and context are consistent

1544
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,520
right

1545
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:37,080
When the context of the entire Central Plains Empire appeared, it was confirmed to appear

1546
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,000
The Central Plains Empire is over

1547
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,480
it just ends

1548
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,200
So it has a corresponding relationship

1549
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:45,080
So from this point of view

1550
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,600
If we're going to write Taiwan's history or something now

1551
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:54,240
Of course, it is impossible for us to find the format of proof to write

1552
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,440
even in mainland China

1553
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,840
I'm thinking there's one that everyone can be very suspicious of paying attention to.

1554
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,240
This is a large-scale compilation in mainland China

1555
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,440
Bi-Historical Project

1556
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,040
So what kind of family history will be compiled in the end?

1557
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,240
This pro-history and the original official history structure

1558
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,040
what difference does it make

1559
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,040
I think that tells us a lot

1560
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,600
Excuse me

1561
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,600
give that first

1562
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:36,840
I am like this

1563
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,760
I read a little history myself because I'm an amateur

1564
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,760
that is sometimes a little worrying

1565
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,160
Are we advocating a historical attitude

1566
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,280
when we study history

1567
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,520
be humble

1568
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,200
be humble

1569
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,480
That is to say, our Chinese nation is not that great

1570
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,160
Yes or no

1571
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:57,840
Even the nations are really not so great

1572
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,040
when we read history

1573
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
When washing history, the so-called formal

1574
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
It will shape our national self-confidence

1575
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
let them

1576
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
For example, from the perspective of various ethnic plots involving various aspects

1577
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
But because this situation is different from other countries

1578
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
There will be quotas and conflicts

1579
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
So shall we adopt a more modest historical attitude?

1580
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
can be compared

1581
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
like in this sense

1582
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
It is very meaningful for you to study the history of ethnic minorities

1583
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
because it can be compared to some

1584
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Chauvinism of the Han Nationality Chauvinism of the Great Qing Dynasty

1585
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Looking at the history of this minority

1586
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Like you take this Otto

1587
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
can have a clearer career

1588
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Is this attitude true?

1589
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
OK

1590
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Thanks

1591
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
My ideas may be more radical than yours

1592
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I just think we have to reflect on those

1593
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Whether it is the Chinese nation or all nations

1594
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
or the concept of ethnic minorities

1595
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I was in a speech not long ago

1596
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
tell my audience

1597
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
We even develop a sense of beauty

1598
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,000
on a hillside

1599
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,000
How many of these thatched cottages are there?

1600
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,500
or a stone house

1601
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
we think it is a kind of beauty

1602
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,500
Because this is called the little tree nation

1603
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,500
Or the settlement of the Round Treemen

1604
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,000
And if there is a sun room

1605
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
We feel that the unbeautiful destroys the beauty

1606
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,500
why do we have to

1607
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,500
They all live in this very high-end sun room

1608
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,000
we encourage some people

1609
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
to practice that beauty

1610
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,000
to live in thatched huts and stone huts

1611
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Why do we call culture

1612
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Our culture is placed in the Palace Museum

1613
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
or where is this

1614
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
inside these museums

1615
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,500
And some people are called the little tree people

1616
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,000
round tree people

1617
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
must be in daily life

1618
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
to practice their culture

1619
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
practice their traditional culture

1620
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Actually I think we have a lot of this

1621
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,500
such a misunderstanding

1622
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,000
or this illusion

1623
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
all because of our commitment to the entire

1624
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,500
This society does not have a real understanding of some of our appearances

1625
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,100
My name is Lin and my name is Lin Nonghai

1626
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,900
my teacher has a historical perspective

1627
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,900
Now in this world, let's say IS

1628
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:28,000
They kill people indiscriminately

1629
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:30,300
without this humanity

1630
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:35,300
Then the United States should help them

1631
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:41,200
He also attacked IS

1632
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,000
But there are many refugees

1633
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,100
America is empathetic too

1634
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:52,200
$4 billion and more recently $4 billion

1635
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,100
to finish this

1636
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,000
But the Soviet Union

1637
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,400
He's going to this series

1638
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,000
do you know

1639
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,440
To help IS, or how to help, to unrest

1640
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:07,000
so i want to remember this

1641
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,040
I think of Huaguo National Limitable

1642
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,920
that miserable world

1643
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:17,160
I've read a lot of the writings of this legacy country

1644
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:21,360
this inside this

1645
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:26,120
Let's do some research and see what can be done

1646
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,200
this to solve

1647
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:33,160
I'm not trying to panic, and I'm not here to help over there.

1648
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:37,520
Help here, expand your own establishment

1649
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,760
have empathy, have sympathy

1650
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,240
To see how the world will change

1651
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,840
Thanks

1652
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,440
thanks i think this we all agree

1653
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,640
you are judging by history

1654
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,320
I look at history

1655
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:57,320
So for this IS question

1656
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,200
this

1657
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,080
i didn't

1658
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,160
I can't say his brother because I don't do research on that

1659
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,360
but i can only say

1660
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,240
Do you feel a little hot

1661
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:07,740
good

1662
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,160
I will briefly talk about some of my views

1663
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,360
In fact, not long ago I

1664
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:14,640
Because I was in Yinchuan not long ago

1665
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:20,040
I also gave a speech in a university for nationalities

1666
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:24,160
Many of my audience are muslims

1667
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:29,040
The topic I'm talking about is related to my gun post research.

1668
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,200
There's a Poison Cat Tale Over the Gun Post

1669
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,480
Let’s say some women in a village are poison cats

1670
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,240
In fact, I simply say

1671
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:41,040
This kind of legend is the same as the story of the witch in the West

1672
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,840
the real behind it

1673
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,640
This is if it is a text

1674
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,640
This legend is treated as a text

1675
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,640
Behind the context

1676
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,840
It is the marginal status of women in a community.

1677
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,240
And such a community is a place that emphasizes purity

1678
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,440
A community that emphasizes boundaries

1679
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,040
will produce this

1680
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,840
We're a phenomenal phenomenon in research

1681
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,840
in this way

1682
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:09,940
In fact, there are many problems of this kind in this IS

1683
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:15,040
In fact, it's all about the purity in it.

1684
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,040
everyone is not just this

1685
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,540
In fact, in many human groups

1686
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:24,440
Everyone emphasizes boundaries, emphasizing purity

1687
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,320
In fact, this is a lot of human

1688
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,560
These suspicions, some of the roots of violent conflict

1689
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,060
this subtitle of my speech

1690
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:41,860
It is called the source of fear, suspicion and violence of human beings.

1691
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:44,860
but today there is no way to talk about this

1692
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:48,060
If you are interested, you can find me

1693
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,960
In fact, you hit the poisonous cat on the Internet

1694
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,860
After that there was a lot of discussion

1695
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,560
In my book "Shooting Between Han and Tibetans"

1696
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,600
There's also a specialization on that poison cat phenomenon.

1697
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,100
Thanks

1698
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:09,480
Yuan Shihao, I would like to ask how the difference in the history of the ancestors came about

1699
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:15,620
Then why now it seems that the history of most countries is built on the history of heroic ancestors

1700
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:21,000
Then it seems that most of the aborigines and primitive tribes we think of are based on the history of brothers

1701
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,800
It is brothers, ancestors, history is the main

1702
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,160
So is there any type of ancestry history other than these two? Thanks

1703
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:33,160
This question is very good, just now I didn't make it very clear, I can add now

1704
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:38,660
So think about it, these two are different societies, one is a continuous society

1705
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:45,160
That is, you have a ruling class and then there are layers of rulers underneath

1706
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,160
Then there are conquerors, there are conquered, there are first comers, there are last comers

1707
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,960
If you belong to such a society, the history you believe in is that kind of heroic history

1708
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:59,960
So you can see that all our complex societies, our so-called civilized societies have a history like this

1709
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,840
Right? That history creates first comers and latecomers

1710
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,160
Whether it's American history or Taiwanese history, it's the same

1711
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,700
The history of the South is the same

1712
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:15,360
But this is the history of the gunman, the brother and ancestor on the other side of the gun

1713
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,660
give us a great inspiration

1714
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,480
That is to say, human society can be like this

1715
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,300
If you believe simple history like that

1716
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,340
In real people, it is

1717
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,440
No first comer, no latecomer, no ruler, no ruled

1718
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,440
right?

1719
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,280
Because that history is that simple

1720
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,340
So if this is about the development of a human society

1721
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:39,440
Actually, a subject that I am very interested in now

1722
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:45,060
I also hope that sometimes if young scholars in the social sciences or history

1723
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,360
Maybe this problem is not something I can solve

1724
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,900
Maybe it can be solved in your time

1725
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,940
because it's a big problem

1726
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,760
Is human society the earliest

1727
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,880
It is in a society that is planned one by one like the history of brothers and ancestors

1728
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
fight each other in the area

1729
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
right

1730
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,000
dare not go out

1731
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Since when did humans develop into a complex society

1732
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
when did it start

1733
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Humans are brave enough to go out

1734
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
by blood memory

1735
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
You can find people of the same race to help you in far away places

1736
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
that i think

1737
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Do you feel that in-depth research

1738
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
This kind of Yizu

1739
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
This comparison between them and guns

1740
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
maybe a clue

1741
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
maybe a clue

1742
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
When explaining the Lord first

1743
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
stuck in 1950

1744
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
in the 1960s

1745
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
It seems that after the founding of the Communist Party of China

1746
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
as if there was a break

1747
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,440
Then I thought of my two or three brothers who had studied with Mr. Liu Shaohua before.

1748
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,440
He also talks about the two-three-one family

1749
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,940
He said that after the 1950s and 1960s, the two or three ones

1750
01:24:10,940 --> 01:24:17,940
It seems to be the very traditional habit that is traditional in the mountains now

1751
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:23,940
These changes by modernity or total regime

1752
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:27,440
will affect his old tradition and model

1753
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:31,440
The teacher's story just now actually stopped at a specific number of years

1754
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,440
I want to know what happened after that

1755
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,440
Or what the teacher just said

1756
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,440
Does the process of the speech just now still exist?

1757
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:46,440
If it does not exist, it is now newly created some memories of his family to change

1758
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,440
Or is it a very formal regime to influence

1759
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:53,440
Then this is the so-called teacher

1760
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,440
situational structure

1761
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:59,440
and then go on to something that has a realistic structure

1762
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,500
ok , ok , that ' s a good question

1763
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:09,500
Let me say it again, that is to say, there are indeed some changes in the structure of reality now

1764
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:13,000
So, I say that culture is actually an appearance

1765
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,500
There is a change in that appearance

1766
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,000
In fact, a simple example

1767
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,500
That is to say, the worship of the three gods of the gun bamboo we just talked about

1768
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:22,500
right?

1769
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:26,000
What about now, because their country

1770
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Especially after the 2008 earthquake

1771
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,500
Bring down all the spears and bamboos on many mountains

1772
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,000
So its traditional fields are useless

1773
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,500
But, there's another big support competition

1774
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:43,000
It is from the grass, from me, everyone knows that the east from the grass

1775
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
From the time when I first went to Gunzhu to do field work

1776
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Two yuan a piece, now forty-five to fifty yuan a piece

1777
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
From the price of grass so high

1778
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Who cares about those boundaries on the hill?

1779
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
right? and then everybody's pushing that line

1780
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,080
Then everyone will stop worshiping the Three Gods

1781
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,340
it is very simple

1782
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:08,780
That is to say, the support boundary between the human beings represented by the three gods

1783
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,700
This has all been changed

1784
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:15,880
Then this worship of the three gods is no longer remembered.

1785
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,040
But there are some social realities that still exist

1786
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:23,880
For example, I thought it was funny when I was doing fields over there

1787
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:28,840
It's from Liang Shanzhou and Ababa Zhou.

1788
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,680
Some of the behaviors of some local cadres I have seen are different

1789
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:37,880
The local cadres on the Abazhou side are often people who take care of their hometown

1790
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:43,380
The local cadres on Liang Shanzhou's side are all from the same family.

1791
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,280
One is a society that pays attention to space

1792
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,240
A society that values ​​kinship

1793
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,240
You see it's still like this

1794
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,240
some things still haven't changed

1795
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:57,040
But basically because the state's involvement is too deep now

1796
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:59,140
This change is very big

1797
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:00,140
but we have this

1798
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Let me give you another small example

1799
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
you know we're going to reflect

1800
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
not necessarily in this

1801
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Before the intervention of contemporary national and ethnic classifications

1802
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's like a utopia, it's not

1803
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
That is to say, that kind of small village does not necessarily look like an ideal country in society.

1804
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I once chatted with an old man who was fighting with guns

1805
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
He told me about the past where they lived in fear of violence

1806
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:32,000
In this endless war between the village and the village

1807
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Then he talked and finally he suddenly smiled wryly

1808
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
like self-deprecating

1809
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:40,000
He said it was because we people in the past had no knowledge

1810
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Didn't know we were one nation

1811
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:46,000
So what I heard at that time was

1812
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
shouting hairs stand on end

1813
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,000
why?

1814
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
as if we were deconstructing this knowledge system

1815
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Right? A lot of our research is deconstructing this knowledge system

1816
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
deconstructing the national identity

1817
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Why do we do this?

1818
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,720
right?

1819
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:04,000
In fact, why did I emphasize a kind of reflective identification later on?

1820
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
that is

1821
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:07,720
You still agree that you are a gunman

1822
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,920
You still agree that you are a Mongolian pawn

1823
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,520
but

1824
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,800
I don't necessarily have to accept what you say

1825
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,920
The history of my mainline defeating your mainline

1826
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,920
it means i have a new way of thinking about history

1827
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,000
under this idea

1828
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,320
i admit i am a gunman

1829
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:23,120
I admit that I am a Mongolian soldier

1830
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,120
right

1831
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,120
that for what you just said

1832
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:32,120
i have a bit of that what

1833
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,120
Carmen

1834
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,120
you just mentioned

1835
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,120
There is a place where there are those brothers

1836
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,120
Their history is different

1837
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:41,120
right

1838
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,120
Then I'm thinking that his brother may not be the brother on the snowman

1839
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,120
or that is to say

1840
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,120
Didn't you just say that?

1841
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,120
That is to say, after he signed

1842
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,120
Then his kinship is all over again.

1843
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,120
It is possible that it was signed by a different place.

1844
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,120
That's called brother

1845
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
But it's not actually the student's brother

1846
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
So they will have different histories

1847
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Maybe it's because of this

1848
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
This is a

1849
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Then again, you just mentioned

1850
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
have a nation

1851
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
He memorized the long, long history of this main line

1852
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
right

1853
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
You remind me of that America

1854
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
There used to be a book called Healing, right?

1855
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
He remembers the black man

1856
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
has been swinging his long, long history

1857
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
That is to say, this thing is very similar to

1858
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
That may mean that some ethnic groups

1859
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
he is very

1860
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
this is good at

1861
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Just remember this long, long history

1862
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
This is my second point

1863
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Then again, that is

1864
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
you just mentioned this confirmation

1865
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
I actually hid the one in Zhongan Jie

1866
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
The one in the ancient book in Zhonganjie

1867
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
so we see confirmation

1868
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I found out that it is the proof of China

1869
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
he is actually

1870
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
that first step

1871
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
we are talking now

1872
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:07,000
It is a history written independently by the writer himself.

1873
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
written from the writer's point of view

1874
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
History of Mathematics from Chinese

1875
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Basically he is from the perspective of the royal family

1876
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
rewrite history

1877
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
So in Chinese political history

1878
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
In fact there is a prejudice

1879
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:32,000
These emperors of China are all placed in this season

1880
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,000
In Chinese history, there is a calendar behind him

1881
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
He put the surrounding countries in the calendar

1882
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Calendar is to put together with ordinary famous people

1883
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,000
he does not have an equal status

1884
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
to treat other surrounding countries

1885
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I think like the CCP now

1886
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
He will not let the president of Taiwan

1887
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Go to an international conference and show up together

1888
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
This mentality is the same as that written in history

1889
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
The policy mentality is the same

1890
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:02,760
right

1891
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,920
He finally said that I am the country

1892
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,120
then you are not a country

1893
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:08,360
we two leaders cannot sit together

1894
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,120
just the same

1895
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,360
So I think our Taiwan

1896
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,960
can actually do one thing

1897
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,320
That is to say, from the perspective of the common people and the people

1898
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,320
to rewrite history

1899
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:20,760
including Chinese history

1900
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,600
Japanese history

1901
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,560
korean history

1902
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,120
And the history of Southeast Asian countries

1903
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,160
then come on again

1904
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:28,160
Inside our wicked traffic room

1905
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,920
we are now in fact

1906
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,960
There are very few exchanges with countries in Southeast Asia

1907
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,080
should be in high school

1908
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,640
The history of these Southeast Asian countries should be handed over

1909
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,800
We now have a close relationship with this country

1910
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,960
There are many foreign brides

1911
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,920
and foreign workers

1912
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,080
But we know very little about them

1913
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,920
So we should use the new angle

1914
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,920
to rethink historical transactions

1915
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:54,760
i think i simply answer

1916
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:57,320
Your two previous questions are all right

1917
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,240
first bro host stuff

1918
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
that's just a historical memory

1919
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
that doesn't mean that means

1920
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
really some kind of blood relationship

1921
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
That has nothing to do with real history

1922
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
But that doesn't mean he's not real

1923
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Which means it doesn't matter if it's real or not.

1924
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
What matters is how you narrate history

1925
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Actually they are telling us

1926
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
when his family history

1927
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
I have noticed my friend of Aiqigou

1928
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
very interesting

1929
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
he just said

1930
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:35,000
How is my waist bully with his second brother and eldest brother?

1931
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Or what about my grandfather and his elder brother and second brother

1932
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
the one he told us about

1933
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
It's about my grandfather's generation.

1934
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Let's talk about our father's generation

1935
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
that statement is different

1936
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
We all start with a grandfather

1937
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
My grandfather had two sons or something

1938
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
they are not

1939
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:54,000
He is just parallel to start like this

1940
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Then I noticed those

1941
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
that is to say it is a memory

1942
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
That means you can't think that

1943
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
a patterned memory

1944
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
like this one of the earliest

1945
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,500
In Tubo's document "Historical Collection of Han and Tibetan"

1946
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,640
He went to record some of China's

1947
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:10,340
The history of the Tang Dynasty

1948
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:13,340
He also said that a certain emperor in the Tang Dynasty

1949
01:33:13,340 --> 01:33:16,240
It's the oldest of his brothers

1950
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:17,640
We saw this and thought it was weird

1951
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:20,380
Because Chinese literature does not record in this way

1952
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:20,840
right

1953
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,280
He still uses this narrative

1954
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,780
what you just said

1955
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:27,980
That is to say, some are not of a certain nationality

1956
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:30,480
Especially good at recording relatively long histories

1957
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,480
I think this is human ecology

1958
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,480
in a human ecology

1959
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:39,480
Some people need to memorize a longer history

1960
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,480
OK

1961
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:45,480
Professor Wei, may I ask?

1962
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,480
Thanks

1963
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,480
I have three questions to ask

1964
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:53,480
In the early 1980s, it happened that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait

1965
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:56,480
After the tee you have studied in the past

1966
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,980
Yours has been there for ten years

1967
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,600
How to apply for the source of funding

1968
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,600
the second one is

1969
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,300
How do they see us Taiwanese

1970
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,100
Do they treat us as Han Chinese or

1971
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,100
still fled

1972
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:13,300
political group

1973
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:16,500
How did you see this scholar from Taiwan?

1974
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,500
Will there be this feeling of being neglected?

1975
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,000
the third one is

1976
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,600
because they you just mentioned they are

1977
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,200
territorial idea of ​​border

1978
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:28,400
Then they were in the previous life

1979
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,300
For the current new ruler in group affairs

1980
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:32,600
It's the Chinese Communist Party

1981
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,300
after unification

1982
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,500
for this

1983
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,400
new leader new

1984
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,300
political interference

1985
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,900
their hearts are repulsive or

1986
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,300
like you just mentioned

1987
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,400
They try to accept him

1988
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:48,300
I have these three questions

1989
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,600
ok seems

1990
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,700
The first question is funding

1991
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,700
I can tell you it's expensive

1992
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,800
What about the moving fields?

1993
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,600
What about a squatting field?

1994
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,800
not the same

1995
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,200
that means you're going a lot

1996
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Then you have to go to a different place each time

1997
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Then I'm just like everyone

1998
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
This National Science Council talks about the International Economic Council

1999
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
we are willing to spend

2000
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
All kinds of things you have to find a way to put into your brain

2001
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
find your funding

2002
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
That is to say, this kind of mobile field is indeed more expensive

2003
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
the second

2004
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
that about you means i'm here

2005
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
they look at my question

2006
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,000
words to the gun column

2007
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
They're all pretty cute

2008
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
That is to say, they think Taiwanese are Han Chinese.

2009
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
You are just like all Han people in mainland China

2010
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Instead, it means I'm over there

2011
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I give a very small example

2012
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I speak Sichuan dialect to them all over there

2013
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,000
because they shot

2014
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Because the language of each place is very different

2015
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
So they are together in Sichuan dialect

2016
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
but the most convenient

2017
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I also use Sichuan dialect for the interview

2018
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I talked to him for a long time

2019
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
The last time a friend of mine was laughing next to Gunzhu's

2020
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
asked an old lady

2021
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Said that Professor Wang came from Taiwan

2022
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
tell you

2023
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Sichuan dialect, why don't you find it strange?

2024
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
The old lady said, is he Han Chinese? Of course I want to speak Chinese

2025
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Because Sichuanese they speak Chinese, but he is Han

2026
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Of course I think there is something strange about Chinese

2027
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
So I don't have that problem

2028
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And of course when I was doing fieldwork over there

2029
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:23,000
I do not engage with all academic institutions, localities, governments

2030
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
So let me teach you a wonderful feeling

2031
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
I was probably lucky, I didn't arrange it on purpose

2032
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I first met a group of local model school teachers

2033
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Their students are scattered in all the township primary schools

2034
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
So every time they take me to the countryside

2035
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's the teacher's teacher who brought his friend

2036
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
So my identity is very much helped by everyone

2037
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
so what's your last question?

2038
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
to the ethnic minorities in mainland China

2039
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,500
That gunman is a very special

2040
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,500
i can say this

2041
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,500
That is to say, because they are caught between Han and Tibetan

2042
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,500
Then he is not a nation

2043
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,500
He is a crowd of many small places

2044
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:15,500
In this way, when identifying and classifying

2045
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:18,500
turned him into a pawn

2046
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,500
So but the history of the Gunners is very important

2047
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,500
Because from the historical memory of China

2048
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:27,500
It seems that some historians think

2049
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:31,500
It seems that part of him has become the current Han Chinese

2050
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,500
Some of them became the present Tibetans

2051
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,500
so this is very interesting

2052
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:39,500
That is to say, if you believe in that history

2053
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,500
Then the gunmen are there again

2054
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:43,500
The existence of the gunman

2055
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:46,500
It seems to prove that history exists

2056
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,500
everyone knows what it means

2057
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,500
so why would there be

2058
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,500
A group as small as 300,000

2059
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,500
become a very important nation

2060
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,500
Because he proves that Han and Tibetan belong to one family

2061
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:57,500
But for gunmen

2062
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,500
they are also proud

2063
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,080
this is the gun column

2064
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:03,880
Of course he doesn't know the historical construction behind it

2065
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:04,840
what those

2066
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,720
All he knows is that they are now one

2067
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:09,040
The gun column under the great history

2068
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,880
And I get another from a myth

2069
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,080
you can tell

2070
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:15,520
they often talk

2071
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,800
Guangong is your ancestor

2072
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:20,640
your god

2073
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,800
Zhou Chang is our ancestor

2074
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,600
our god

2075
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,160
So he has a lot of local myths and legends

2076
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:30,120
They all tell the story of Zhou Chang and the official

2077
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,560
In fact, there is a myth

2078
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,480
That is to say, Zhou Chang thinks

2079
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,240
There are more and more Han Chinese here

2080
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:36,680
feel bored

2081
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,080
He wants to carry a big rock

2082
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,600
shut the gate

2083
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,800
Don't let the Han people in

2084
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,360
He turned out to be a ghost

2085
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:45,080
great strength

2086
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,200
no mind

2087
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,120
and only at night

2088
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,640
So when he was carrying a big rock

2089
01:38:49,640 --> 01:38:52,240
that official is very cunning

2090
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,200
Basic Education for Officials and Officials

2091
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:58,600
Zhou Chang just threw the stone and ran away

2092
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:00,040
So now the Han people are still here

2093
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,500
that's all

2094
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,900
So what I mean by this joke is that

2095
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:05,900
even if it's a joke

2096
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:07,600
even a myth

2097
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,900
his appearance

2098
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:11,100
There is an image behind him

2099
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:14,900
The original image is the expression of their feelings

2100
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,000
he still feels

2101
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,300
as if he accepts himself on the one hand

2102
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,000
The edge given to him by the Han

2103
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,600
image of minorities

2104
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,000
Strong and brainless

2105
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,300
On the one hand, he thinks that the Han people are cunning

2106
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,600
We can't beat the Chinese

2107
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,200
so we have to be like this

2108
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,600
But from other myths

2109
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,400
he told me again

2110
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,600
he said look

2111
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,400
That Zhou Chang of yours is holding a Daguan knife

2112
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,400
Why did he choose Zhou Chang?

2113
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,000
is very meaningful

2114
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,500
Zhou Chang is holding a Daguan knife

2115
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:44,300
standing behind the Han

2116
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:46,000
he means

2117
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,700
He said you Chinese

2118
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:51,000
We are standing with the Han people

2119
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
We are different from those Western Fans

2120
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,600
That Xi Fan is independent

2121
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,400
Xifan refers to the Tibetan

2122
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,000
Because they often hear Tibetans seeking independence

2123
01:39:59,000 --> 01:39:59,800
so at this time

2124
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,400
He has

2125
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,760
He wants to choose a side, he is sandwiched between Han and Tibetan

2126
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,760
So he chose to go out of state

2127
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,760
We are standing with the Han people

2128
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,760
then speak more exaggeratedly

2129
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,760
You see, you Han officials still need our protection

2130
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,760
We stand behind him with big knives

2131
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:17,760
So you from these myths and legends

2132
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,760
or some popular local images

2133
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,760
In fact, they are all signs

2134
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,760
Regardless of the history I just analyzed earlier

2135
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,760
These myths and legends that I am telling now

2136
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,760
or images are actually the same

2137
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,760
what i promote

2138
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,760
Then what I want to advocate is

2139
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,760
How do we learn from these representational phenomena

2140
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,760
Inside to see the real side

2141
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,760
return some of the emotions in it

2142
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,760
Hello Mr. Wang

2143
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,760
my question is

2144
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:49,760
China was a unified country during the Qin and Han Dynasties

2145
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,760
Then the Western Roman Empire

2146
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:54,760
It is also a unified empire

2147
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:57,760
Well, after China's continuous division

2148
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,760
It will also revert to the situation where the unity

2149
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
But after the division of the West, it became countless small countries

2150
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
This phenomenon is caused by the use of

2151
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Apart from geographical factors

2152
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
this problem is too big

2153
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I really have no way to answer

2154
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
But I'm thinking of having a

2155
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
I think I think it's the same wherever I say it

2156
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
This is what I said in mainland China and Taiwan

2157
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
From the point of view of human ecology

2158
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
If you take the whole of Eurasia

2159
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
cut in half

2160
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Half of them are from China

2161
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Emphasis on diversity

2162
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Put all Xinjiang and Tibet in one big China

2163
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
the other side is

2164
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
There are several very rich and powerful small countries along the coast

2165
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
in France, Germany, England, etc.

2166
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Then the inland is often involved

2167
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:56,000
In this chaos of ethnicity, gender, religion, etc.

2168
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Then everyone saw the recent large number of refugees

2169
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,600
flee to the east

2170
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:06,600
If everyone was a scholar of modern history

2171
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:07,800
everybody knows

2172
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,400
At that time Sun Yat-sen and many of these revolutionaries

2173
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:15,200
early revolution this home

2174
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,600
also advocates building a very small China

2175
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:25,400
And leave Mongolia, Tibet, and all Xinjiang outside

2176
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,400
If a China like this was established at that time

2177
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,400
in that human ecology

2178
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:33,000
I think it's still the same today

2179
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,200
Refugees are not only running to the west but also to the east

2180
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:42,100
So in terms of human ecology, I think the eastern half

2181
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:45,100
So far it looks like it's better than the western half

2182
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:47,400
But overall

2183
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,400
still too far away

2184
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:52,400
That is to say, the whole so-called pluralism issue in China

2185
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,900
There are still many problems inside

2186
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:56,600
to solve

2187
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Thanks

2188
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I’m honest, I’m a student who has studied the Chinese language of the teacher in animals before.

2189
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
The one who saw the teacher before

2190
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
At the edge of China, first recruit people from the teacher

2191
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
The previous part is very incomprehensible

2192
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
But the more I read the teacher's book, the more interesting I find it.

2193
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Especially when the teacher talked about Taiwan in the last piece

2194
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
The teacher mentioned in it

2195
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Because that book was written by the teacher at the end of the Twenty-Four Classics

2196
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Then it mentioned some of the status of Taiwan's aboriginal research at that time

2197
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Especially in the past two years, it seems that it is more and more easy to see on the Internet that there is a saying

2198
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Think that the vast majority of people in Taiwan are descendants of the poor

2199
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
In fact, I re-read the teacher's book recently, and I feel very emotional

2200
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Is there any way for many teachers to make some expansions for this place?

2201
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Thanks

2202
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,680
This is what happens all over the world

2203
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:12,920
I think everyone just often has some imagination

2204
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,560
Imagine who our main thread is

2205
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:16,880
In fact, he is showing a reality

2206
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,240
Sometimes we don't need to pay too much attention

2207
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:24,440
or to criticize the imagination

2208
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,120
or constructed history

2209
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,680
I think what we should do instead

2210
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:30,520
is to analyze this imagination

2211
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:35,600
what is this emotion or intention behind it

2212
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,600
This time my answer to your question

2213
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,400
Well, today we are very, very grateful to Academician Wang

2214
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:50,880
give us such a wonderful speech

2215
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,640
Answered many, many questions

2216
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:55,640
Okay, thank you

2217
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,800
