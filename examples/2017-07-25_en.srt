1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,300
No.

2
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,720
donated to the Commission's made in China a

3
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,840
research provided by the government city

4
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,660
and some political participants from China

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,680
have passed this task.

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,400
why not is a

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,800
whole woman

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,340
moisturizer

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,180
effective

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,020
only

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,380
Welcome everyone to join the feast of knowledge tonight

12
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,000
The topic of today's feast of knowledge is

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
Holy Heaven hand dance community

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,200
Then letâ€™s talk about the heat hazards and PM2.5 that are right in front of us

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
so we know that

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,200
We live in Taipei City, New Taipei City

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,500
This densely populated urban area

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,900
For our health in this environment

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,300
There are many manufacturers

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,600
Manufacturers are very dangerous

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,400
especially in this summer

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,200
hot weather

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,100
So what we often see

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,700
health hazard

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,500
are these hot temperatures

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,100
High temperature and so-called PM2.5

27
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,500
So the Academia Sinica in this respect

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,700
There are also some basic research

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,300
Some researchers are focusing on these

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,000
Greater health

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
related topics

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,840
with some more basic

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,760
basic scientific research

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,520
hope to clarify

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,880
There are some special situations

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,520
also can hope to be able to say

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,480
tell everyone

38
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,000
How do we avoid these hazards

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,080
so today's speaker

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
It's researcher Long Shijun

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,600
He is our Academia Sinica

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,400
environmental change

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,120
research center

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,960
a teacher researcher

45
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,520
He is from National Taiwan University

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,720
The first graduate of science from a large enterprise

47
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,520
sit down please give me three minutes

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,040
at Harvard University

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,800
School of Public Health

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,640
Got a Ph.D.

51
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
in a famous

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
a chair professor

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,240
Under John Spankles' door

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,960
he has been for a long time

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,760
Finally, 15 years of expertise is in the study of these thermal hazards

56
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
air pollution

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,440
These assessments of these hazards of these risks in this environment

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
that uses the scientific method

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,560
Because some organic chemistry analysis is to be done

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,080
To design the instruments for these detections

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,800
especially in many specialties

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,400
His expertise is mainly in the analysis of the components of organic coke

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,280
Because of his achievements on such an important subject

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,120
In 2004, he won the Qiusheng Award of the Taiwan Air-Coke Society

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,680
He's doing a lot of things on this side of public service at the same time

66
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:58,440
Participate in committees related to environmental quality or government agencies in Taipei City

67
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,040
so today

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
he came back and told us

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
probably explain

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I now tell everyone

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Very familiar with what is PM2.5

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
contained in

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
what is basic science

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then our current

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
heat hazard is what we are now

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
today

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
at this

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
July

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The temperature we must face

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and the quality of our air

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
so i thought i would

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
don't spend too much time

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
us

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
had a great speech

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
so we ask everyone

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Welcome with loud applause

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Researcher Long Shijun

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Give us today's Sisi Banquet

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
thank you all

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you Vice President for your introduction

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you all for your support on such a hot day

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come to this evening

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
this little feast of knowledge

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When I was in National Taiwan University

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
actually learned by

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
this

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
air mass

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,540
How to transmit How to cause the diffusion of pollutants

99
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,540
this aspect

100
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,540
but i'm in the harvard school of public health

101
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,200
What we want is actually from a human perspective

102
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,240
for departure

103
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,540
It's human-centered, let's talk about it

104
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,700
What kind of environmental factors

105
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,340
will affect my health

106
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,840
OK so this neighborhood we live in

107
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,940
In fact, it is the environment that most affects our quality of life.

108
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,740
So that's what we're most concerned about

109
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,480
The type of living in this community in Asia

110
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,780
Not the same as Europe and the United States

111
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,380
everyone knows

112
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,080
because we are densely populated

113
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,680
then densely populated places

114
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,240
Traffic is heavy again

115
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,980
So our doorstep

116
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,040
often within an hour

117
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,780
Thousands of vehicles will pass by

118
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,580
Unlike the existing residential areas in Europe and the United States

119
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,240
they may be within a day

120
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,640
ten cars that will pass

121
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,240
His own and his neighbor's

122
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,280
the exposure

123
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
It's just that the exposure is completely different.

124
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,540
So we live in communities where there are many

125
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,940
like this close at hand

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,340
The source of traffic pollution is the catering industry that we pass through every day to and from get off work

127
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,900
Even public temples or some small factories

128
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,000
These are all sources of pollution that are in sight

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,640
When I came back to my country, I found that these Asians are very special

130
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,640
And it is very important source of pollution to our life

131
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,000
but few studies

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
so i just jumped in

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,540
Hope to use a scientific and systematic way

134
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,040
to study these pollution sources

135
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,900
What is the incremental exposure to us?

136
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
What is the impact factor behind it

137
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
How can we reduce its impact

138
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,140
Protect our own health

139
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,140
At the same time, I myself was born with an atmosphere

140
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,340
So under climate change

141
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,400
everyone's getting hotter

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,500
So for thermal hazards I can also combine

143
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,400
Expertise in Atmospheric Sciences and Public Health

144
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,640
to discuss

145
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,640
So today's talk will take these two as the topic

146
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
is how we go deep

147
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,340
How does my team go deep into the community

148
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,800
Then study the thermal hazards in front of you and follow the 2.5

149
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,740
I'll start with this

150
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,240
Start with thermal hazards

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
at least

152
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,560
Well, this is, this is no longer news to everyone.

153
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,840
That is, every year, we break records in high temperature.

154
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,040
OK, it's been three years in a row, this opinion says yes

155
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,340
hottest ever hottest ever and then set new highs three years in a row

156
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,880
OK so climate change becomes the norm

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,420
So we will face more and more frequent

158
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,420
This heat wave continues at this high temperature

159
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,520
Then Taiwan will be connected with the subtropical zone

160
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,340
Therefore, in the words of ordinary people, it is likely to think that

161
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,760
I grew up in such a hot environment

162
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,100
I have long adapted to the heat

163
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,300
So it shouldn't have any effect on my health

164
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,840
OK, when I talked to you about heat hazards more than ten years ago

165
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
The general reaction is like this, including doctors OK

166
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,340
let's see

167
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,340
This was ten years ago OK

168
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,580
there is sad news out

169
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,720
Three days of heat killed three old farmers OK

170
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,620
After this incident, everyone realized that

171
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,020
Taiwan may also experience heat hazards

172
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,600
Then every year this

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,840
Such unfortunate things happen almost every summer vacation

174
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,340
Then this is this year

175
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,740
ok the latest

176
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,980
Elderly man hangs clothes for three hours and passes out due to heatstroke

177
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,880
And he was also in the

178
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,000
this asphalt road

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,540
Wounded hands twice

180
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,940
When I was sent to the hospital, my temperature soared above 40 degrees.

181
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,540
Well, such an unfortunate case

182
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,840
Fortunately, he was rescued later.

183
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,040
Then you might think that this is an isolated case

184
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,900
Ok, what about the statistics from the Ministry of Welfare?

185
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,040
In fact, it's only halfway through July

186
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,640
Nearly 300 people in Taiwan

187
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,240
All sent to the ER for heat hazard, thermal injury.

188
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,340
ok more than ten years ago

189
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,940
When we first started to study the issue of thermal hazards

190
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,040
The Ministry of Health and Welfare does not have one like this

191
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,540
Notification System of Thermal Hazards

192
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,140
now have

193
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,040
because it is true

194
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,540
Even the doctors in the emergency room will encounter many

195
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,540
An example of an emergency room visit due to a thermal hazard

196
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,240
ok that's in the whole

197
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,040
What about the World Health Organization?

198
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,140
Based on our current scientific evidence

199
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,040
to estimate future climate change scenarios

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,380
Let me explain this A1B to you

201
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,460
In fact, it is still a medium carbon emission

202
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,620
Even if it's not the most carbon-intensive situation

203
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,980
Even under a moderate carbon emission scenario

204
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,420
in Asia

205
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,500
Regardless of whether it is a high-income country in the Asia-Pacific

206
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,060
or East Asia or Southeast Asia

207
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,860
Cases of additional deaths due to the impact of climate change

208
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,100
The number of thermal hazards is the largest

209
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,180
much higher than other

210
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,380
Infectious diseases caused by climate change

211
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,140
Style hot, hot, warm, thick and aggressive, etc.

212
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,380
That's because the current high temperature is long

213
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,740
Soar to 38, 40 in one go

214
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,820
It is far more than our body can bear

215
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,860
Even these Asia-Pacific high-income countries

216
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,460
We say that Taiwan belongs to this

217
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,620
Although we have a good infrastructure

218
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,860
We have good medical resources

219
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,940
But when the ambient temperature is so high

220
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,940
unless we don't go out

221
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,860
Unless we're all locked in an air-conditioned room

222
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,060
Otherwise we'd all likely be exposed to heat hazards

223
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,060
that would make sense

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,360
some weaker ones

225
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,200
Including children, the elderly, pregnant women

226
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,720
He already had this cardiovascular disease

227
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,000
He will be exposed to heat hazards

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,400
it may cause misfortune

229
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,440
So whether this is estimated in 2030

230
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,560
Same as the 2050 projection

231
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,440
Thousands of people will be exposed to heat hazards

232
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,840
so the countries of the world

233
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,920
Therefore put this for thermal hazards

234
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,120
Countermeasures

235
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,720
is how we adjust

236
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,920
OK response

237
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,680
Future climate variability like this

238
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,840
challenge to us

239
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,080
as one of their top priorities

240
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,760
OK

241
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,440
According to this methodology, Taiwan

242
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
We also made our own estimates

243
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,760
There are probably hundreds of them every year.

244
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,800
Cases of additional deaths due to thermal hazards

245
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,720
Most of them are also concentrated in people over the age of 65.

246
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,640
then you might think

247
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
is this overrated

248
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
People around me don't seem to have

249
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,320
How to feel the heat hazard

250
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,320
We go to work early every day at most

251
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,040
You'll be fine if you hide in an air-conditioned room

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,220
OK to share with you

253
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,780
what we do in this community

254
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,620
Actually go into people's homes to do measurements

255
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,100
This is the past few years we have been in the two areas of Gaoping, Greater Taipei

256
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,220
We recruited 62 volunteers in three communities

257
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,620
Let's go to his house to measure

258
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,060
The temperature between the outdoors of his house and his indoor living room

259
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,660
OK, then we have the same 62 data

260
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,860
We use different groupings

261
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,220
like boys and girls

262
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,060
This age, North and South, etc.

263
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,860
Then I want to point out that it is the last item.

264
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,620
He opened the window and turned on the air conditioner.

265
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,620
Of course we all know

266
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,460
Turning on the air conditioner is of course lower than the temperature with the windows open

267
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,380
But have you seen their temperature?

268
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,460
OK, this one with the window open

269
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,700
There are three households, and it's almost 40 degrees.

270
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,060
OK this isn't our first time at home

271
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
40 degrees is measured inside the house

272
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,260
Actually many times

273
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,060
When I came back from the first test, I told my assistant about yours

274
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,180
There's something wrong with that thermometer of yours, take it in and have it calibrated again.

275
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
He said the calibration is fine

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
It's not about his abandonment

277
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
That house is really 40 degrees

278
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I said why the air conditioner is not turned on at 40 degrees?

279
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
how can you bear it

280
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
He said that grandpa told me

281
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
He only turns on the air conditioner when his grandson comes

282
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
usually he is at home

283
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
He thinks it's amazing that I've lived like this all my life

284
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm used to it

285
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
this is a reason

286
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
One reason is that the air conditioner is too costly

287
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
too expensive

288
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
So he can't bear to leave

289
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
and some housewives

290
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
He's actually at home because he needs to spend his own money

291
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
So they don't turn on the air conditioner

292
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Compared with our usual white-collar stage

293
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Blow on the air conditioner when we go to work

294
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
the situation is very different

295
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
So Taiwan does have such a situation

296
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
We are among the 62 defenders

297
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
There are only 13 people who turn on the air conditioner

298
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,500
And he is actually in the middle of the air-conditioning

299
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Because we measured and found

300
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
His indoor and outdoor temperature

301
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
In fact, the correlation is as high as 0.9

302
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,440
We just wondered how is it possible?

303
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,720
If you turn on the air conditioner for a long time

304
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
Shouldn't the temperature be this low?

305
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,680
First, they didn't turn on the air conditioner very low.

306
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,360
This is the first point because it saves power

307
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,840
The second one is very honest if there are several

308
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,200
talk to my assistant

309
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,840
that's because you're coming

310
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,520
So we were the first ten minutes

311
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,040
just turn on the air conditioner

312
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,960
for going to meet him

313
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,160
just feel sorry

314
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,320
Someone has guests and the house is very hot

315
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,200
OK so in this case

316
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
So their correlation calculation is quite high

317
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,160
So this means that

318
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,440
We are actually in this ordinary household

319
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,400
There are many situations that do exist

320
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,480
is that they may all be potential

321
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,640
Possible Groups of Thermal Hazards

322
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,960
Because they generally don't turn on the air conditioner at home

323
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,080
ok so this is the show saying

324
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,840
our taiwan words

325
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,960
In fact, we have to formulate this dark countermeasure

326
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,120
is to adjust

327
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,480
The government needs to adjust the strategy

328
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,200
is very very important

329
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,400
then our scientific community

330
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,200
How can we help the government to

331
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,240
What about the adjustment strategy for this thermal hazard?

332
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,840
The first thing we can do is

333
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,000
we can do this

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,080
In this rigorous climate change adaptation strategy

335
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,520
Advance Scientific Assessment Process

336
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Vulnerability Assessment

337
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,960
The vulnerability assessment

338
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
it's easy to say

339
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,680
But it's also very complicated and difficult to do

340
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,920
The first is to figure out what are the highly vulnerable communities

341
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,240
Vulnerability by definition

342
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,720
Briefly introduce to you

343
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,360
It actually has three aspects

344
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,560
This is also very intuitive

345
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,560
The first is how much heat hazard I'm exposed to

346
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,440
This is exposure

347
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,160
but the same exposure

348
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,160
some people can stand it some people can't

349
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
For example, if I have a heart vessel

350
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I'm weak if I have a disease

351
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,760
So the same heat is for me

352
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,360
may not be able to bear

353
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,000
OK

354
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,680
So this sensitive word

355
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,920
It's a person's physique

356
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,200
personal physical characteristics

357
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,160
including the older

358
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,280
pregnant women

359
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,320
fetus

360
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,800
very young child

361
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,120
this is sensitivity

362
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,320
Or the underprivileged who are involved in sperm, etc.

363
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,000
this is sensitivity

364
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,560
if you come again

365
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,800
Responsiveness should also be considered

366
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
words of resilience

367
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,960
means

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,600
Is there any way for me to deal with the heat hazard from the outside world?

369
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,800
I hid in the air-conditioned room

370
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,500
This is the best countermeasure

371
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,300
OK so I can do it in my profession

372
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,900
But many people's occupations cannot do this.

373
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,600
So it may not be able to cope well

374
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,500
So which are

375
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,300
That's because the sensitivity is mostly a matter of personal constitution

376
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,700
So the main thing we want to discuss here is

377
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,500
Who are the high-risk groups

378
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,900
Who are the low ability groups

379
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Can we find out the features

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
Therefore, social welfare units can target these

381
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,100
The words of this highly sensitive and vulnerable community

382
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,600
Then come here and do something better

383
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
This measure of prevention, sanitation, etc.

384
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,300
The questions we have to answer then include

385
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,200
Are the people actually

386
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
He actually suffers from heat hazard levels

387
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
is it really serious

388
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Are there any high-risk communities?

389
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,100
what is his actual risk

390
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,000
that for

391
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,300
If we're going to talk about thermal hazards

392
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,100
but more important

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
how to deal with it

394
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
OK

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Coping

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In terms of countries around the world

397
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Most Important Coping Strategies

398
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
All thermal hazard warnings

399
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
OK

400
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
just to tell you in advance

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
heat is coming

402
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We have heat for days

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So everyone spend less time outside

404
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
or drink more water

405
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
then wipe your face more

406
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
sweating etc.

407
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
is to use this prior prevention

408
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So if we want to have this

409
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
word on heat warning system

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Which one is the appropriate heat hazard index for Taiwan?

411
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So if we're going to issue a heat warning like this

412
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We need to find the appropriate pre-limit value

413
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So this is all science

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
can help to answer this question

415
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
this is our team

416
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
this direction of this effort

417
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
so let me introduce

418
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
is how we go

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Find out which are the most vulnerable communities

420
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
OK

421
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
In fact, in the past few years, if we

422
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
very hard

423
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
we follow this survey

424
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Cooperation with the Research Center of the Academy of Industry

425
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Telephone interview conducted by OK Face-to-face interview

426
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
then we also

427
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Trying to take advantage of this relatively advanced network

428
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,800
The Crowdsourcing Approach The Information Science Approach

429
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,200
Cooperate with the teachers of the information center

430
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,300
Ways to do research with mobile phones Online research

431
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,600
In fact, if it is a telephone interview or a face-to-face interview

432
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Of course the cost is high

433
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,500
OK, online surveys are cheaper than mobile surveys

434
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,000
And it can have 4,000 or 8,000 copies in two weeks

435
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,300
wow so fast so great

436
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
So I can after the heat hazard comes

437
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,500
go to this survey

438
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,000
this is very good

439
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,700
what a pity

440
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,000
everyone will know

441
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,300
Who will actually fill in these questionnaires on the Internet and on the mobile phone?

442
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
just young people

443
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,900
Young people are not a highly vulnerable group of heat hazards at all.

444
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,300
so it becomes

445
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,400
This method is scientifically feasible

446
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,200
We also built something like this

447
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,900
Crowdsource this survey method

448
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,700
Unfortunately not so suitable for use in this heat hazard

449
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,500
So we later or later

450
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,400
The information for this interview was done at a lot of cost.

451
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
In terms of noodle shops

452
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
eighty percent

453
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
we smoked this

454
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Respondent's words

455
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
would reject us

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So we're going to draw 10,000

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The middle two thousand finally succeeded

458
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Telephone visits have a higher rate of giant visits

459
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
90%

460
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But these actual visits

461
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
is able to give us

462
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
very in-depth information

463
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's go into more detail

464
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
scientific discussion

465
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The words here are also sincere, please everyone

466
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If you get a call some day

467
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
investigate or

468
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
remember to the end

469
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Plus say you want to interview

470
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
please say yes

471
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
science that can help us

472
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Research

473
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So we base this

474
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The interview information

475
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
explore

476
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
High-risk groups and low-hard ability groups

477
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
feature

478
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
When these features are many

479
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Sincerely

480
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Our first focus is

481
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,340
He was forced to spend a lot of time outside

482
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,840
What are the characteristics of which communities?

483
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,000
OK, the male is less educated

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,440
Part-time jobs for remote witnesses

485
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,720
Also engaged in these industries

486
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,080
Agriculture, forestry, cloud, wood, mining, manufacturing and construction

487
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,620
or wholesale shipping

488
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,880
Some of them are known from the literature

489
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,520
but some are not

490
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,760
Include wholesale shipping like this

491
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,960
We thought he drove a big truck

492
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,220
He actually has air conditioning in the car

493
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,220
We actually asked a few drivers

494
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,380
He said some cars were simply too old

495
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,720
I can't turn on the air conditioner at all

496
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,620
I turn on the air conditioner and the engine gets wet

497
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,720
this is a little

498
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,860
The second point he said

499
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,020
In fact, many of us smoke

500
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,300
so if we smoke

501
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,260
The windows won't close at all

502
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,740
So they won't turn on the air conditioner

503
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,200
Because you didn't turn on the air conditioner

504
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,060
OK so they become

505
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,740
longer time outdoors

506
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,500
They spend more time in the sun

507
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,820
It's like this, this has such characteristics

508
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,020
Then everyone because of the cold

509
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,920
In this regard, I just mentioned

510
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,280
In fact, some households do not have air-conditioning or use less air-conditioning

511
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,800
Like the family elders who don't have a high description in this family, etc.

512
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:15,120
As for these materials, we will also provide them to the Ministry of Health and Welfareâ€™s Social Housing and Family Affairs Bureau.

513
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,460
their social workers said

514
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,980
Their social workers have already made calls in hot weather.

515
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,780
To care for these elders in the ethnic group to remind them that

516
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,000
Drink plenty of water, rest more, don't go out in hot weather, etc.

517
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,680
OK, everyone can do this

518
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,000
Okay, let's take a look at our province's actual

519
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,200
More than 2000 respondents

520
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,600
To find these more than 2,000 respondents, we must not be alone.

521
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,760
So we are also with this research center

522
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,720
Together, 25 interviewers were trained and then

523
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,200
Visit these 50 villages across the province

524
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Then our execution period is from the genus to the autumnal equinox

525
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,760
In fact, there may be autumn tigers in the middle

526
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Then this visit

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
It's actually very special

528
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,140
This is the first time environmental science and social scientists have collaborated

529
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,260
So these interviewers' questionnaires were

530
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,060
Not just to ask social questions

531
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,100
Also ask environmental science questions

532
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,780
Even more powerful

533
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,660
they actually

534
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,100
we also train them

535
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,980
Help us carry the temperature and humidity in quarantine

536
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,180
and photodetector

537
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,100
to monitor the environmental conditions inside and outside their homes

538
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,740
OK

539
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,340
So you see these little boxes in front of you

540
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,900
It's all these quarantine-style environments.

541
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,540
Talk about quarantine

542
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,460
But it is the precision that must be able to conform to scientific data

543
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,020
OK

544
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,060
The data can also be transmitted

545
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,500
good

546
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,380
That's how it works

547
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,900
We also provide

548
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,740
The person from the family of the Ministry of Health and Welfare

549
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,300
we just say

550
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,660
your social worker

551
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,820
during home visits

552
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,940
Maybe take a quarantine test with you.

553
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,460
The indoor and outdoor temperature of his old man's house

554
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,780
This will help them clarify

555
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,140
What kind of old people

556
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,980
In fact, I usually don't turn on the air conditioner at home.

557
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,460
OK

558
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,220
So you can find this advanced

559
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,260
vulnerable communities

560
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,460
What we are talking about today is testing

561
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,460
Detect environmental conditions inside and outside the home

562
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,740
means we are testing

563
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,740
the extent of its thermal hazard

564
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,500
We want him to understand the extent of its heat hazard

565
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,340
So we're going to the next question

566
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,740
What is the appropriate indicator of thermal hazards in Taiwan

567
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,160
This is a few years ago in New York

568
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,960
Rarely does the mass media address this

569
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,060
Proposed that heat is not just high temperature

570
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,620
The terrifying combination of temperature and humidity is even more terrifying

571
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,220
So we all know in Taiwan

572
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,260
If also under the condition of high temperature

573
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,060
if the humidity is high

574
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,960
We can't sweat out

575
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,520
So we will feel more heat and pressure

576
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,860
OK more sad

577
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,420
So humidity is a very important factor to consider

578
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,060
in meteorology

579
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,820
We learned it when we were sophomores

580
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,620
There is a comprehensive index of temperature and humidity called damp heat index

581
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,620
OK

582
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,080
But what about the humidity index?

583
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,360
In fact, it's just looking at everyone's thermal comfort.

584
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
It's called Somal Comfort

585
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,720
It's whether you are comfortable or not

586
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360
It is based on a questionnaire

587
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
so just ask you

588
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
you are in this environment

589
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,860
Is your work efficiency good?

590
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,160
Are you in a good mood? Wait a minute

591
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,320
It doesn't really ask us now

592
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
most concerned about climate change

593
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
Somal Stress is heat pressure

594
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
heat hazard

595
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
It's just my body index is fast

596
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
It's just the heart beating

597
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm dying

598
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
I'm about to pour that before

599
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
do i want to prevent this

600
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,840
not if i'm in a good mood

601
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
or something uncomfortable

602
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
So Somal is

603
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
For comfort and heat stress

604
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Thermal hazards are a different concept

605
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
So what about public health?

606
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
In fact, there are more suitable

607
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
of public health

608
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
The heat hazard index

609
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
OK then we all know

610
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
if in

611
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,360
If it is windy this summer

612
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,560
wow so comfortable

613
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,040
so there is a lot of wind

614
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,480
So wind speed is another factor to consider

615
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,840
Therefore, in addition to temperature and humidity, wind speed is very important

616
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,280
one more

617
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,400
You see that girl breaks up in summer

618
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,080
On the one hand, I am afraid of getting sunburned.

619
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,520
On the other hand, each umbrella has a shadow

620
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,040
not exposed to direct sunlight

621
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,520
we are much more comfortable

622
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
So in fact by the sun

623
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,920
Is it solar radiation from direct sunlight

624
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,200
It actually affects our own heat

625
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
this symptom of this body

626
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,680
It is clear

627
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,880
So temperature and humidity

628
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,720
wind speed and solar radiation

629
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,040
All four factors are important

630
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,920
That

631
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,920
There is actually such an index in public health

632
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,880
It's called the neutralization temperature heat index

633
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,440
The solution is called WBGT

634
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,440
It is to consider these four

635
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
this indicator

636
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Then this WBGT is actually in public health

637
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,920
In the case of labor

638
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,240
Labor safety and health has already been used

639
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,000
seventy years

640
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
His early years were developed by the United States Marine Corps

641
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
He noticed that when the soldiers were practicing

642
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
or in a submarine

643
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In the case of high temperature and sweltering heat close to the boiler

644
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
They use the physiological response of soldiers

645
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Classify it like this

646
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The most serious is WBGT above 32.2

647
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
is black flag

648
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The black flag indicates that the company's soldiers are physically strong

649
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No able-bodied soldier should be in that situation

650
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
prolonged exposure to the sun

651
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
or prolonged exercise

652
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So this is the black flag

653
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
After these five categories are also used in

654
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
On the Classification of Occupational Safety and Health in the World

655
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
someone mentioned

656
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Both soldiers and labor friends are in good shape

657
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Are their indicators suitable for ordinary people?

658
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,560
Therefore, some domestic scholars have also studied

659
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,860
Indeed, from the health insurance database

660
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,160
Mortality rate of all causes of death in Taiwan

661
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,500
Significant increase above WBGT35Â°

662
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,820
In terms of the total rescue rate

663
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,160
Significant increase above WBGT33 degrees

664
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,480
WBGT actually uses cost as its standard

665
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,280
Because it is actually three

666
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,400
It is the wet bulb temperature, the black bulb temperature and the air temperature are the sum of degrees

667
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,240
it has a weight added to each other

668
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,600
We also talked with Mr. Tang Jingsheng from the Department of Public Health of Fuzhou University

669
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,160
I also read that it is suitable for the general public

670
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,720
Is that suitable for the elderly?

671
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,760
So Mr. Tang here

672
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,320
healthy elderly

673
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:50,700
Then let's compare WBGT with other evil indexes that we are familiar with

674
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,000
Let's talk about these for the elderly

675
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,080
Which is the most appropriate indicator of harm

676
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,660
After comparison, it is still WBGT

677
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,800
So to show this WBGT it can actually be shown to the general public

678
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,300
What's more, it is suitable for the sensitive group that is the most important to this heat hazard

679
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,200
is the old man

680
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
So we know that with WBGT

681
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,800
So if we are indoors

682
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,600
We use WBGT to measure

683
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,500
The luminosity we measured, etc.

684
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,800
In the end, it is converted into the index of WBGT

685
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,000
Then our total

686
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,200
Its practical questionnaire has interviewed more than 2,000 households

687
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,000
But we have limited equipment

688
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,600
So only more than 500 households accept our indoor testing

689
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,200
Then the last data is exactly 500

690
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
What about the middle 500?

691
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,600
There is this 20% and the other 36%

692
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,700
5% of the total are red flags and black flags

693
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,400
OK

694
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,700
The words of the red flag mean that the community with a sense of co-branding is likely to pay attention

695
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,600
it shouldn't stay in that environment for too long

696
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,200
So in total there are 26 households

697
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,900
What about the 26 households?

698
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,600
it this game is black flag family

699
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,100
it is

700
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,880
The temperature in the room, if they have a thermometer in the house

701
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,200
The indoor temperature has actually reached more than 4 billion

702
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,260
So they actually know just by looking at the thermometer

703
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,280
They should do some adjustments

704
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,140
whether it's going out for a walk

705
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,980
We actually had

706
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,600
One of the grandmothers, their house is really often more than 40 degrees

707
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,900
His home is Xishai, ok

708
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,980
then we say

709
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,900
Let's just say that the temperature in your era is too high

710
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,080
So if you usually say, is it when you are drying in the stream

711
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,840
What do you do, do you often drink water?

712
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
how about washing your face

713
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,800
He still laughs at us, ok

714
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,980
He laughed and said, I'm not that stupid

715
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,400
He said that when the temperature reaches 40 degrees, I will

716
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,880
Hiding out, I hid in a nearby hypermarket

717
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
Blow off the air conditioner

718
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,440
ok, but luckily the old grandma is nearby

719
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,280
There is a hypermarket within 15 minutes of this walk

720
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,640
So if people in remote areas probably don't have

721
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,840
Then he has nowhere to hide

722
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,780
ok so there are a lot of these

723
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,780
Well, if two of them don't have air-conditioning at all

724
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,780
this device

725
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,760
Other words are reluctant or do not need to open

726
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,960
Nine people thought that the temperature at that time was not bad, just right

727
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
if he really has hot room sex

728
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,840
it's okay

729
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,480
But what we're afraid of is that he doesn't feel it himself.

730
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,360
Because like some old people, he is old after all

731
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,080
He feels a little slower

732
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,520
what is afraid is what is said

733
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,040
It's too late when they feel this discomfort

734
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,680
OK

735
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,320
So for these households

736
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,960
In fact, all the more than 500 households

737
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
We'll all be based on the condition of his room

738
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,920
Will give a feedback at the end

739
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,440
Just suggest that they can be in the summer

740
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
what to do when it's hot

741
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,440
accommodating behavior

742
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,120
including air conditioning

743
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,360
then drink more water

744
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,360
And actually there is a meaning to tell us

745
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
not just drink more water

746
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
It is better to drink more jelly or jade

747
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
He said it's because it's a jelly-like jelly

748
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,800
So drink the water in the stomach sometimes

749
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,040
If you just rush out, it will make you electrolytically swell

750
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
unbalanced

751
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,980
What if it's Aiyu or this fairy grass?

752
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,480
He was frozen in the frontier

753
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
After the festival, he will discharge it slowly

754
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,840
So it's better for our body

755
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,340
OK

756
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,500
So we all gave him these opinions

757
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,880
hope is good for them

758
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,040
Then we also put these relevant information

759
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,080
also gave this

760
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,340
The Social Welfare Department of the Ministry of Health and Welfare is a reference

761
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,480
ok so we're indoors

762
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,980
There are tests like this

763
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,780
Then we are also in the community

764
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,360
OK

765
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,280
We put this quarantine room

766
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,960
This meteorological observation instrument with solar cold plate

767
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,760
Measure the temperature of these greenhouses

768
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,480
Wind speed, solar radiation, etc.

769
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,360
Then these words are spread infinitely

770
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,880
Integrate with our partners

771
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,980
Go to this network platform of Mr. Chen Fangzhang of this information center

772
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,920
that these this

773
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,380
Actual measurements in the community

774
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,920
we are actually

775
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,380
specially placed

776
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,020
Everyone will walk and pass

777
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,520
Like asphalt road, red brick road

778
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,960
or on the cobblestone road

779
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,020
Because that's what everyone actually does every day

780
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,300
This situation of thermal hazards actually received

781
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,480
Then everyone knows how the Meteorological Bureau measures since they were young, right?

782
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,780
The standard test is a white house in the middle of the grass

783
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,580
Baiye Township. The inside of Baiye Township should not be exposed to direct sunlight.

784
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,540
But when we are outside, we are directly exposed to the sun.

785
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,900
Below us is the asphalt road.

786
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,640
So what is the purpose of the weather bureau testing him?

787
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,840
not for going

788
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,980
uh measure our heat hazard

789
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,900
He is here to say

790
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,900
Meteorological data should be able to be used as a reference with other countries

791
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,300
So they must have a standard measurement method

792
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,040
But this standard measurement method is not suitable for us to measure this thermal hazard

793
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
So we are in each

794
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,940
The words of the community are actually measuring their actual thermal hazard

795
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,240
that traditionally

796
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,740
uh industry

797
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,740
It should be said that public health

798
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,540
We measure thermal hazard

799
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,440
this

800
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,440
The instrument used is actually this one

801
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,340
Well we're going to call him a gauge for WBGT

802
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,640
If this station

803
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,240
he has a black ball temperature

804
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,880
This is very important and related to radiation measurement.

805
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Now some meteorological units in various countries in the world already know the parameter of WBGT

806
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But they haven't been able to put WBGT into the program, which they think is harmful to the index.

807
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Within this early warning system

808
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The main reason is that these standard meteorological conditions around the world

809
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Meteorological parameters measured Meteorological parameters

810
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
There is no way to convert it into this black ball temperature

811
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
There is no way to convert it into black ball temperature

812
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So you can't use the WBGT classification we just talked about

813
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
There is a final reasoning in the middle

814
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Our team tried to find a way to connect the last line of reasoning

815
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We also checked the literature

816
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
In fact, there are already many

817
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It should be said that there are several articles

818
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Use meteorological instruments and WBGT to do this comparison in a certain place

819
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Then do this experience room

820
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But this experience room can often be used in Japan, but it cannot

821
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,900
not available in Taiwan

822
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,320
Why is Japanese?

823
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,260
It is very different in this environment

824
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,860
OK

825
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,560
So it is subject to local restrictions

826
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,440
Fortunately, we found one

827
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,840
is in the literature is a national laboratory of the United States

828
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,480
it made

829
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,440
It is a way of theoretically deriving heat transfer

830
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,400
Deduced

831
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,040
In the end our meteorological parameters

832
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,600
How to convert to WBGT

833
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,840
But what about the transformation of this?

834
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,040
It has only been tested at five locations in the US

835
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,400
Not tested anywhere else

836
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,000
It's like Taiwan's high temperature and high humidity

837
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,900
So we also have to come to Taiwan to test

838
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,280
so we are in taiwan

839
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,880
in this North Central South

840
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,740
At least ten communities were tested before and after

841
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,680
different types of communities

842
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,840
ok then we are

843
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,240
In this use the meteorological parameters just now

844
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,280
After measuring the meteorological parameters, it is transformed into this theoretical room

845
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,580
we get a

846
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,600
The estimated value of this routine observation

847
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,280
OK

848
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,640
Then compare it to WBGT

849
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,040
This instrument traditionally

850
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,600
Compare with the instrument actually used in public health

851
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,760
Everyone can take a look

852
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,200
In fact, the correlation is very good

853
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,800
0.99 then its synergy is 1

854
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,360
We have accumulated more than 3000 records

855
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,000
ok

856
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,760
After getting this information

857
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,560
of course we are happy

858
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,640
Then I went to my senior from the Meteorological Bureau and said

859
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,440
Hey senior, it can be used now, right?

860
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,240
You see we continue to do so well in Taiwan

861
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,400
So you can use this WBGT as the indicator of the stomach damage index, right?

862
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,160
He said hey girl

863
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,560
You have studied meteorology for so long

864
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,720
do not you know

865
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,960
The weather bureau's most important thing is the forecast

866
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,000
what you can't predict

867
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,480
so I'm useless

868
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,200
You told me that your measured values â€‹â€‹are very close

869
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,160
It's useless

870
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,320
To be accurate

871
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,520
good

872
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,480
So we spent a lot of effort

873
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,200
I will find teacher Lin Chuanyao from our center

874
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,400
He also has a forecast mode

875
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,000
I am looking for Dr. Hong Yingshan, my classmate from the Meteorological Bureau

876
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,640
Then he himself has the model used by the Meteorological Bureau

877
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,560
private weather company

878
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,760
They are also very interested in our WBGT

879
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,080
They are also willing to initiate

880
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,320
give us a forecast

881
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,720
So we have three different patterns

882
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,840
But the data we've presented so far is one of those patterns

883
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,760
we are

884
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,120
Their model data predictions give me

885
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,360
It is forecasting 48 hours data to me

886
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,480
Then we tested locally

887
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,280
After WBGT

888
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,720
Let's compare it with his model

889
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,320
In fact, compared

890
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,200
In fact, the correlation is quite high

891
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,400
0.94

892
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
words from our WI

893
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,360
For example, it is 0.98

894
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,480
is also very good

895
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,960
so i think

896
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,720
In the future, we will continue to discuss with the Meteorological Bureau

897
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,960
That is to say, we can actually use existing models to make forecasts

898
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Of course I know the weather bureau is more cautious

899
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,400
It needs to have accumulated enough data

900
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,520
we are now too

901
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,320
provides a lot of information

902
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,400
The proof hopefully will convince it

903
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,800
So this is in the schema section

904
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,040
We test in the community

905
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,800
just mentioned

906
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,200
We can use the local meteorological survey

907
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
to convert

908
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,120
His local survey

909
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,680
In this view the harm index WBGT

910
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,640
We also do measurements at altitude

911
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,880
more than three floors

912
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,200
We have a thin trail above the ground

913
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,360
Or do it on the red brick road

914
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,640
then we can take a look

915
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,720
In fact, this WBGT

916
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,200
the ground layer that we humans actually walk on

917
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,120
It is on average better than

918
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,720
WBGT of nearby Meteorological Bureau stations

919
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,960
1.5 degrees higher on average

920
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,920
OK

921
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,040
But correlation is good

922
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,280
0.7

923
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,200
So I also talked to Qishang School

924
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,920
In the future, if you predict

925
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,600
In fact, at least our

926
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,240
70% of this

927
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,000
Credibility

928
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
that is

929
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,160
you just said you can believe it

930
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,120
then we are here with you

931
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,440
We only need to take this data from your forecast

932
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,320
because it predicts

933
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,800
It's probably data from weather stations.

934
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,440
We add 1.5 degrees C

935
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,200
Basically we are walking on a normal thin path

936
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,960
say actual heat hazard

937
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
That'll be fine

938
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,300
Take a look, the maximum value we measured on the ground floor is actually as high as 41

939
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,600
We are already in the black period just on 32.2

940
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,400
But we actually measured it to be 41

941
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,300
Of course no one will walk on Boyue Road for 8 hours

942
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,520
I hope not, so I hope no one will keep saying

943
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,800
Spit into such a large high value

944
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,800
We are actually estimating, and we use this to calculate

945
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,700
This Taipei City, because Taipei City is a basin

946
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:36,200
It is easier to gather heat and not easy to dissipate

947
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Therefore, Taipei City is usually the place with the highest temperature in Taiwan.

948
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,700
Itâ€™s not that Kaohsiung is quite windy, so itâ€™s actually Taipei

949
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,300
So we look at Taipei City from 2002 to 2016

950
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:55,300
In the past 15 years, the maximum value of WBGT on the same day exceeded 32.2 days

951
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,500
How many days?

952
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,100
more than 1000 days

953
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
OK

954
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,500
it is in the summer half

955
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Let us suppose

956
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,160
I think Taiwan is now only tantamount to saying

957
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,500
Two seasons of winter

958
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,960
In fact, even winter is full of heat

959
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,160
Summer half year is from May to October

960
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,200
If we only count the half year

961
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,960
It actually accounted for 37% of the more than 1,000 days

962
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,300
it's impressive

963
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,560
means to say

964
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,660
throughout the second half of the year

965
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,400
more than a third of the time

966
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,100
In fact, every day exceeds this

967
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
We consider thermal hazards

968
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,660
more severe days

969
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,160
then such a situation

970
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,900
among us feel

971
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,400
If there is timely warning data

972
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,900
how good is it

973
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,460
like this

974
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,400
people will know

975
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,300
it's too hot outside now

976
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,060
I don't want to go out

977
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,500
or me the athlete

978
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,300
half training says

979
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,560
we better come back now

980
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,900
don't train outside

981
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,700
But because now the Meteorological Bureau

982
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,900
Even if we convert his kitchen

983
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,200
But the Meteorological Bureau is now on the Internet

984
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,100
this timely

985
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Timely data on the website

986
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
With temperature, humidity and wind speed

987
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But it doesn't have this timely

988
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Information about solar radiation

989
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
OK so

990
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Our dating house

991
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Our team is in the whole province

992
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
From this 2016

993
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It has been established since last year

994
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
15 successively established

995
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Outdoor Seven Observatory

996
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
OK we just want to put this

997
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Radiation data can be disseminated in time

998
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Then we can calculate

999
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
This WBGT in time

1000
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
OK last year it was

1001
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
hottest year hottest year ever

1002
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
In Taiwan, it is

1003
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
If WBGT is calculated, it is July

1004
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
This is when the WBG is the highest

1005
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
that july

1006
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
July 28 is the highest day of WBG

1007
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
OK, let's see for a couple of days

1008
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The whole month of July last year followed

1009
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
This July 28th

1010
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This WBG distribution map

1011
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,500
Our calculations are based on 12 hours in the daytime.

1012
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,900
The one on the left is the average of 12 hours of daylight in the whole month of July

1013
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,500
Then we also see that there are a few black spots here

1014
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,800
ok Momotsuki wait for this

1015
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,900
Those two black dots

1016
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,200
It's still going on for a whole month

1017
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,500
This average is as high as 32.2

1018
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,800
So these two are probably due to the terrain

1019
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
The wind speed is relatively low or this

1020
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Factors such as relatively high rock and soil will cause this

1021
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,100
This is actually a social welfare unit or a labor unit.

1022
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,500
The key point to pay attention to in the future

1023
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,700
that was on july 28th

1024
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Full water has more can daytime 12 hour average

1025
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,300
Belong to this more than 32.2

1026
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,600
ok, that part of Taoyuan, Taozhuniao

1027
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,300
Then the following words are this

1028
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,100
Kaohsiung and Pingtung also have some

1029
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,500
The thing that surprised me the most was actually

1030
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,200
first place ok first place

1031
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,760
Obviously it is Yonghe District in New Taipei City

1032
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
OK

1033
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,000
Because I myself grew up forever

1034
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,520
i can't believe our yong ho will win the championship

1035
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,840
It's actually 33.5 degrees during the day

1036
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,080
after i know this

1037
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,120
I will tell my mother

1038
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,520
Because my mother is in the group that does not turn on the air conditioner at home

1039
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,120
Because she also thinks she is used to it

1040
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,560
She washes her face and it's fine

1041
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,720
So I just told her please please later

1042
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,600
We have already won the first place in the province in this matter.

1043
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,120
OK, in the future, you must turn on the air conditioner, what do you want?

1044
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,080
Fortunately, she believed me this year

1045
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,920
This year, at 12:00 noon every day

1046
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,320
she will drive for an hour

1047
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,640
then tell me it's nice

1048
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,680
One hour can measure four hours

1049
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,280
OK

1050
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,720
So at least I don't have to worry about her this year.

1051
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,360
but this

1052
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,320
Converting this WBGT has this benefit

1053
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,600
just to help us figure out where it's going to fall

1054
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,560
So this labor unit or social welfare unit

1055
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,360
can focus on these villages

1056
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,440
Okay, when we were drawing this picture

1057
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,600
Actually we still have this

1058
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,920
adjusted in some scientific way

1059
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,040
to correct this

1060
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,260
heat island effect

1061
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,560
We all know that in the city because of the relationship between the buildings

1062
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,640
So it creates this heat island effect

1063
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,040
That is to say, cement and thin oil cannot dissipate after absorbing heat

1064
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,440
So it's going to be warmer than the usual suburbs next to the suburbs

1065
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,040
So we're using the government's numerical terrain model

1066
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,360
We built the three-dimensional volume of the building with a five-meter resolution

1067
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,460
Think of it as a three-dimensional urbanization indicator

1068
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,200
This three-dimensional urbanization index we also go to

1069
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,720
Take that and compare it to the temperature distribution on satellite imagery

1070
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,200
In addition, there are more than 30 measuring stations of the Meteorological Bureau in Taipei City.

1071
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,700
its ground station

1072
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,460
Then do the correlation

1073
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,060
Its correlation is very high

1074
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,560
Therefore, the three-dimensional urbanization index is also a good indicator to look at the temperature distribution.

1075
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,960
But I built another biggest purpose is to

1076
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,620
I hope it's for urban planners to see

1077
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,920
So if everyone here

1078
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,720
If someone is doing urban planning

1079
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,760
Because always prevent residual treatment

1080
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
OK, we're still working hard to build a house

1081
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,300
And it's covered with cement

1082
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,120
This house is reinforced concrete

1083
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,760
So every house built

1084
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,960
In fact we just add this

1085
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,000
The volume of this three-dimensional building

1086
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,160
Unless they can find some heat sink

1087
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,000
compare this

1088
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
The materials of these buildings that are not so tall

1089
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,800
Otherwise they are all increasing our thermal conductivity

1090
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,120
and adding weight to this under our climate change

1091
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,520
warming shock

1092
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,120
OK

1093
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,400
So I think this thing should be reminded of this

1094
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,920
urban planner

1095
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,160
OK, let's take a look again.

1096
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,520
In fact, everyone feels that the weather is very hot this time.

1097
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,160
OK

1098
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,920
so this was a few days ago

1099
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,400
Last week, July 19th

1100
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,920
12:00 noon to 1:00 pm

1101
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,120
this hour

1102
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,320
Let's take back the temperature from the weather bureau

1103
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,800
its geographical distribution

1104
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,920
Then we also use our

1105
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Traditional Radiation Information

1106
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
We ourselves use

1107
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
The Meteorological Bureau has a total of more than 300 stations for temperature, humidity and wind speed

1108
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
plus our own radiation data

1109
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
We can quickly calculate this WBGT

1110
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
We can look at its distribution

1111
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Indeed something is different

1112
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Especially in some of the more important hotspot areas

1113
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
WBGT because it considers more

1114
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And the more important parameters related to physiology

1115
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So it can identify more detailed

1116
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Some important black spots

1117
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
black area

1118
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
These exceed WBGT

1119
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
These areas are beyond the black area

1120
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
This is our afterthought

1121
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The data is recovered and drawn with GIS

1122
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
The best paintings are those that can be drawn in time

1123
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Now we are also cooperating with Teacher Chen from the Information Office

1124
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
We are available online in real time

1125
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
First present these temperature data from the Meteorological Bureau

1126
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And the temperature data of our own 15 stations

1127
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and add it to our radiation profile

1128
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Convert to WBGT

1129
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,500
So this is the data at 1:30 pm on July 20

1130
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,000
You can see many places

1131
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,300
In fact, many places in the western half are black chess

1132
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,100
There is only one area in the middle

1133
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,100
It's because of the cloud and the relatively strong wind speed.

1134
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,700
So the temperature drops faster

1135
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,500
The north side too

1136
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,200
On the Danshui side, because the wind blows

1137
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,500
So it goes down faster

1138
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,700
What about the black chess

1139
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,800
lasts until 4 p.m.

1140
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,000
OK, it lasted so long

1141
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,600
OK, so in fact we're observing this immediate

1142
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,400
Sometimes it is found that there is a thermal hazard

1143
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,900
Black's words will continue until 6:00 p.m.

1144
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,900
OK, this is

1145
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,700
especially in this

1146
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,800
Special attention should be paid to those who work outside the office

1147
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:48,900
then we also want

1148
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,800
In the future, we can cooperate with the Meteorological Bureau in this regard.

1149
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,300
be able to take the data we've built

1150
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,500
available to the Bureau of Meteorology

1151
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,200
This WBGT warning can be issued in the future

1152
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,900
with this instant observation

1153
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,500
Currently the Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau is very interested in

1154
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,100
We are currently cooperating with the Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau

1155
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,020
It is hoped that the system of Relujing in Taipei City can be established

1156
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,020
So let's look at that day

1157
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,520
At 1:30 p.m. on July 21

1158
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,320
The whole city of Taipei is black

1159
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,800
Because Taipei City is not easy to dissipate heat

1160
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,860
is a basin center

1161
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,860
Only Yangmingshan is slightly more comfortable

1162
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,860
Look at the white in the middle

1163
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,360
says it has no data

1164
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,860
Because we follow the weather station

1165
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,360
Draw a circle if its diameter is within 5 kilometers

1166
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,860
So there are missing values â€‹â€‹in some places

1167
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,860
In the future, we hope that

1168
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:52,360
Real-time prediction of thermal hazards for the Taipei area

1169
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,860
Currently cooperating with Taipei Environmental Protection Bureau

1170
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,360
In fact, we are on top of the earth lock of Academia Sinica

1171
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,860
There is a weather station that we set up

1172
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,440
We originally wanted to set it up on the roof of the Japan Ministry

1173
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,600
However, there are too many outlets of air conditioners on the roof of the Japanese department, which will affect our data

1174
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,100
So it was not set there

1175
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:14,320
We are in Taipei except for the stop of Zhongyingyuan

1176
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,720
We also have four other stations

1177
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,360
It was done for the Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau

1178
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,760
So we also analyzed the historical data of Taipei City

1179
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,840
last 15 years

1180
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,760
If we only look at May to October

1181
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,600
We look at the highest WBGT of the United States and Japan

1182
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,420
On which level of thermal hazard would it be distributed

1183
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:39,680
From the perspective of 2016

1184
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,520
There are actually 103 days

1185
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,520
It's more than half the time it's on black paint

1186
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,520
this is serious

1187
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,320
So everyone don't want to say

1188
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,920
What price can be placed above 32.2 degrees

1189
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,720
it's impossible

1190
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,000
Because this is the norm for us

1191
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,480
But we can indeed remind you

1192
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,800
at this time

1193
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,040
For example, children should not go outside

1194
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Or athletes marked outside training

1195
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
or how outdoor workers protect themselves

1196
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
If we take this

1197
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
The 99th percentile of the daily maximum temperature for the past 15 years

1198
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That is 36.8%

1199
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
If used as another level of classification

1200
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
we are one more level

1201
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
The hottest year in 2016 last year

1202
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
about 5 days

1203
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
would be this higher than this 36.8%

1204
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
so it's possible

1205
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
We are still discussing with the Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau

1206
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
say it's possible

1207
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
if you really want to post this

1208
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
In other words, I suggest that everyone should not go out.

1209
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It is possible that the relatively high temperature

1210
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
as this pre-value

1211
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Of course such discussions

1212
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
There's a lot behind this

1213
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
science we have to try our best

1214
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
including our statistics institute

1215
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Teacher Huang Jingxiang is cooperating

1216
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
just look at this

1217
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Use health insurance data to analyze

1218
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
this some health

1219
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
healthy data

1220
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,300
We based on the past 2000 to 2014

1221
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,900
Including the number of emergency visits, the number of old visits or

1222
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,500
The number of deaths after 2008 The number of deaths from all causes

1223
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,700
We can currently see about 32.5 degrees or more

1224
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,500
WBGT32.5 degrees or more

1225
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,000
Or above 33 degrees, it is a sharp rise

1226
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,500
As for this part, we are still working on it.

1227
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,000
But that's pretty much it

1228
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,300
The relevant information is quite consistent.

1229
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,100
Next, we also see another

1230
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,100
The high-risk group we just kept mentioning

1231
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,800
It means working outdoors, especially construction workers

1232
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,300
It is dried by this long-term shop

1233
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:43,100
This is a person who works on site to block steel bars

1234
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,800
This is the Labor Safety Office of the Labor Council

1235
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,500
labor safety office

1236
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,000
They know we're doing this outdoor WBGT

1237
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,600
So they also come to cooperate with us

1238
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,800
Then last year, we found five long-term jobs

1239
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,300
Letâ€™s take a look at the actual process of labor that we have seen in the five long-term jobs

1240
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
work situation

1241
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,700
This one is in Banggang

1242
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,900
Then this word is doing this template

1243
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,800
It has this cement in it

1244
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
have this plank

1245
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,000
These are heat-absorbing materials

1246
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:11,700
ok

1247
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,900
Then this is doing electric welding

1248
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,000
and next to it is a surfboard

1249
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,700
tree with surf boards reflecting sunlight

1250
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,300
also very dazzling very hot

1251
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,500
The electric welding is also a very hot

1252
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
So they are in the workplace

1253
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,500
There are a lot of things that are

1254
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,900
within a meter of them

1255
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,700
They will have accumulated high temperature

1256
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,400
so they are exposed to thermal hazards

1257
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,900
Probably very different 10 meters away

1258
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,400
ok

1259
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,400
so what about this

1260
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,900
That's why Labor Bran

1261
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,700
He hopes to develop a wearable device

1262
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,800
Therefore, Mr. Chen Yanzhi of our information center

1263
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,700
Also use a small one for them

1264
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,000
Sensing of miniature temperature, humidity, etc.

1265
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,700
go get a small one like an orange bag

1266
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,000
Tied to this waist of labor

1267
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,800
so these words

1268
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,200
help us to tie this orange bag

1269
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,400
let's see

1270
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,100
like this

1271
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
I admire this pre-resident worker the most

1272
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,840
He's going to stand on that pre-dwelling steel girder

1273
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,640
Because he wants to direct where the two pre-occupied pillars will fall

1274
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,720
Once he stood there, he couldn't get down for two or three hours.

1275
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,640
OK

1276
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,760
Then I want to say that when I went to this construction site at seven o'clock in the morning

1277
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,760
I have already sunned into this big Hanlin

1278
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,920
Then he will stand there for two or three hours

1279
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,240
really hard

1280
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,440
The director of the construction site told us that

1281
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,120
don't be afraid

1282
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,160
They are heat acclimatized

1283
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,720
They've been doing this for so long

1284
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,000
none of them matter

1285
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,160
That's what these laborers told us

1286
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,480
He said they were used to it

1287
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:34,960
OK

1288
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,600
But Tian Wenjun also told us at the same time

1289
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,720
In fact, more than half of them have this kind of experience

1290
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,920
It's just that none of them seek medical attention

1291
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,160
just drink more water

1292
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,080
Then just rest there

1293
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,880
OK

1294
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,560
So although these are for us

1295
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,600
maybe not

1296
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,720
This is the ethnic group with high ranks

1297
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,600
so they may be fit and healthy

1298
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,040
not what we usually say

1299
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,880
This community that seems so sensitive and fragile

1300
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,400
But think about these strong and strong people

1301
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,960
Maybe it's the spirit of the family

1302
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
the backbone of the economy

1303
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
in case of falling down

1304
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Most likely a whole family is broken

1305
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So the Ministry of Labor knows this very well.

1306
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So the current word is hope to say

1307
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
There is this wearable this

1308
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Thermometric Hazards

1309
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Then the data can be transmitted to the back-end platform

1310
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
What about this platform?

1311
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Can let the site supervisor see

1312
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
so they can do this time shift

1313
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
just don't let the same person

1314
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Do a frequent exposure to high temperature thermal hazards

1315
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
this is too serious

1316
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So if his way of working hours is allocated

1317
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
reduce the heat hazard

1318
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
OK

1319
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
over here

1320
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Everyone has seen that there is a

1321
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
goats

1322
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
are you happy

1323
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's just that someone is finally going to break up these laborers

1324
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
No, I lied to you

1325
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
good self-deception

1326
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
It's true that there were breakups at the construction site

1327
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
but not for labor

1328
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
OK

1329
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It's an underground archaeological site

1330
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
OK he was actually trying to prevent this

1331
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Archaeological artifacts scattered by sun-baked camps

1332
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
In fact, the bottom line

1333
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Because of the dispersion, it is more stuffy

1334
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
OK so actually

1335
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,460
In fact, this is both good and bad.

1336
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,960
Then when we actually do it on the spot

1337
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,160
Except this worker has this wearable

1338
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,860
We also have this on site with this mobile weather observer

1339
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,220
Because some laborers

1340
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:18,100
It's inconvenient to have these devices on your body

1341
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,400
So let's also try

1342
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,160
Look, if there is a mobile weather observer

1343
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,900
Is it possible to explain them this too?

1344
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,000
Measure roughly

1345
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,900
they may be exposed to heat hazards

1346
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,700
Let's also compare it with the battle of the Meteorological Bureau, which is one or two kilometers away.

1347
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,600
Here is our data

1348
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,500
Let's take a look, this is actually

1349
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,800
A time sequence from nine o'clock in the morning until the afternoon when you get off work

1350
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,500
ok

1351
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:47,400
What about these red lines are these five different workers

1352
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,900
Five different workers each day

1353
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,660
ok

1354
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,600
That blue, dark blue line is the mobile meteorological instrument we have on site

1355
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,300
And the blue line is the weather station of the Meteorological Bureau that is farther away.

1356
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,100
It's obvious here

1357
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Apparently seeing the weather station, the temperature of labor timing may be five or six degrees worse

1358
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Even the blue people on the scene may sometimes be two or three degrees off

1359
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:21,000
It means that the promotion of workers is actually affected by many reflections, whether it is heat-absorbing steel bars, cement, wood boards or corrugated boards.

1360
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Let me show you again. We know that the black flag is 32.2. There is a black flag drawn here.

1361
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
So most of the time here is actually in the afternoon because of the heavy thunderstorm, so everyone went on vacation

1362
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
During thunderstorms, the construction industry cannot work for fear of danger, so there is no work for this matter.

1363
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But under other circumstances, you can see that most of their time, working time may be more than 65%

1364
00:54:52,000 --> 00:55:00,000
All of them are under the status of WPGT is black flag, so it shows the situation of their industry

1365
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,600
Gao Shou's siege of flesh is actually quite serious.

1366
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,320
But we asked the worker

1367
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,000
Workers don't really want a holiday

1368
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,480
because they are everyday

1369
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,980
Profitable

1370
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,320
He only makes a day's money for every day he works

1371
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,120
so he has no interest in vacation

1372
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,440
what do they want

1373
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,560
They want it to be like the Law Enforcement Office

1374
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,320
That is, if someone moves it or arranges it during working hours

1375
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,400
or even they some employers are better

1376
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,960
That is, from 12:00 noon to 3:00 p.m., there is no need to do anything

1377
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,200
He just rests but he gets off work late

1378
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,600
they would like to do it like this

1379
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,880
So they also reduce their own meat damage

1380
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,800
Then it won't affect their money making

1381
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,120
This is a win-win situation

1382
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,200
everyone can see say

1383
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,440
when we measure

1384
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,120
In fact, it can also be clearly seen

1385
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,120
Sometimes they go to blow the air conditioner

1386
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,080
during lunch break

1387
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,680
There will be this red line that is down and down

1388
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,680
Said that they were lucky to have a real rest during their lunch break

1389
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,920
This is the real situation in the labor workplace

1390
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,080
So let's talk about this regression

1391
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,500
We explore the vulnerability of this thermal hazard

1392
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,740
I just talked a lot about measuring WBGT

1393
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:07,740
If we look at it in July 2013

1394
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:10,140
Probably the highest in Taipei

1395
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,100
Then we divide into 7 equal parts

1396
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,580
The red word means it is the most serious

1397
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,900
The northern part is the same as the Taichung area

1398
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,140
Possibly the highest WBGT

1399
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,580
In terms of sensitivity

1400
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:24,800
In fact, the proportion of the elderly population is relatively high

1401
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,040
The population of young children is relatively high

1402
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,300
like this Huadong area

1403
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,080
so it's red

1404
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,480
that they are the most sensitive

1405
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,200
Then we also consider the existing

1406
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,100
Cardiovascular disease visits

1407
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,000
we also took it into consideration

1408
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,400
to draw this sensitivity map

1409
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,800
In terms of shadow ability

1410
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,240
We consider the community's

1411
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,800
its this medical resource

1412
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,540
The ratio of their air conditioner

1413
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:48,000
and his community

1414
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,480
this society

1415
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,880
It should say community development association, etc.

1416
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,240
The number of these social organizations

1417
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,500
Then draw this map

1418
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,200
Everyone can take a look

1419
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,760
In fact, the central region

1420
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,760
ok even

1421
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,200
In the area of â€‹â€‹Ganan

1422
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,100
Response ability is relatively weak

1423
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,400
so red is the worst

1424
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,900
Okay, let's combine these three dimensions

1425
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,200
You can draw the whole of Taiwan

1426
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,600
This map of vulnerability to thermal hazards

1427
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,900
It can also be clearly seen here

1428
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,200
Although the northern region

1429
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,300
It seems that the risk is higher

1430
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,100
But because of the strong response ability

1431
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,100
The characteristics of the population are also less sensitive

1432
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,400
So it's actually only a few

1433
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,900
A place with a relatively high population

1434
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,400
belong to the sixth level of high vulnerability

1435
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,400
Others are fine

1436
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,500
central words

1437
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
Instead it is because

1438
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:31,300
Central and Yoga South

1439
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,500
Possibly a relationship of lower coping capacity

1440
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,300
So the vulnerability is higher

1441
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,900
Next is the part of Pingtung

1442
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,200
Taitung Night Market

1443
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,100
Of course, this vulnerability will change with the change of society.

1444
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,500
including population changes

1445
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,500
Changes in social conditions

1446
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,600
with us this

1447
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,600
Changes in the risk situation environment

1448
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,200
So this is actually a rolling

1449
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,600
can be modified in the map

1450
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,800
If our government has a good countermeasure

1451
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,900
We can also use this vulnerability map to see

1452
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,500
So his coping strategy

1453
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,720
Does it help various regions after implementation

1454
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,400
to reduce their vulnerability

1455
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,240
That's what vulnerability maps are for

1456
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,920
So what we just mentioned is

1457
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,600
Vulnerability to this thermal hazard

1458
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,600
straight up climate change

1459
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,800
How to impact our sensitive community

1460
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,560
its exposure, its response

1461
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,400
However, in addition to the direct impact

1462
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,400
There is also an indirect pathway of influence

1463
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,800
That is by affecting air pollution

1464
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,120
when the temperature is high

1465
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,560
The volatility of many pollutants is relatively high

1466
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,040
Its photochemical work is also relatively strong

1467
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,040
Therefore, there are more pollutants in production and survival

1468
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,000
and some are

1469
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,600
when the temperature is high

1470
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,680
sometimes it's this

1471
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,800
The conditions for domineering diffusion are bad

1472
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,400
For example, there was this high pressure a few days ago

1473
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,520
hot high pressure

1474
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,800
High pressure is equivalent to

1475
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,280
There is a cover on it

1476
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,280
OK submerged layer

1477
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,120
So there is this submerged layer phenomenon

1478
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,040
Therefore, air pollutants are not easy to diffuse out.

1479
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,480
Therefore, the concentration of air pollutants will increase

1480
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,180
words to people

1481
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,440
That is when he is in hot weather at the same time

1482
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,120
subjected to heat stress

1483
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,360
Also under pressure from air pollution

1484
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,820
What about the two pressures?

1485
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,960
Affected organs are all heart or lungs

1486
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,760
may be cardiopulmonary organs

1487
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,860
As far as humans are concerned, this is double

1488
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,920
This um affects double pressure

1489
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,060
so we are doing

1490
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,300
thermal vulnerability

1491
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,260
Apple also polluted the air at the same time.

1492
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,220
At the same time, the most important words for that are

1493
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,880
The pollutant PM2.5

1494
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,560
this is us

1495
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,720
just mentioned

1496
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,880
Generally speaking, what kind of interdisciplinary approach do we use

1497
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,720
And then actually target other than doing this

1498
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,840
In addition to the distribution of this heat hazard in geography

1499
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,380
We actually also targeted air pollutants

1500
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,000
Our purpose is to hope to be able to construct

1501
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,240
Adaptation strategies based on scientific data

1502
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,040
That is how to do something better

1503
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,480
Government policies can help us reduce

1504
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,720
The impact and risk to health

1505
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,080
ok so this

1506
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,820
The results of our first issue after we did

1507
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:07,000
Thank you also to the Center for Sustainability for organizing a results presentation

1508
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,020
We invited representatives from 17 institutions

1509
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,620
covers a lot

1510
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,120
including the Department of Health and Welfare like the Bureau of Meteorology

1511
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,500
EPA, etc.

1512
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,900
We are opening a lot of reps

1513
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,900
are very interested in our research results

1514
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,820
So there are words like this after the Meteorological Bureau and the Ministry of Health and Welfare

1515
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,520
They also asked us to continue the meeting

1516
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,700
see how we can help them

1517
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,220
certain relevant policies

1518
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,260
Like the Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau and the Ministry of Labor

1519
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,360
Later also by the Bureau of Meteorology

1520
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,660
They also suggested that these two units come to us

1521
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,360
to continue to do the next heat hazard effects

1522
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,100
So our policies

1523
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,460
In addition to saying to continue to communicate with these government units

1524
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,460
other words

1525
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:53,780
I think it is very important to talk about how we can provide more miscellaneous stones

1526
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,780
scientific data

1527
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,240
can help them cope better

1528
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,240
That's what we're planning

1529
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,820
this purpose

1530
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,220
then this part

1531
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,260
And of course it also includes parts like air pollution

1532
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:05,820
ok

1533
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,920
Then this is what we do in the community

1534
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,260
We just talked about walking and jumping community

1535
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:11,420
It's what we've done in the community

1536
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,720
we are at ground level

1537
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,860
good or level

1538
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,060
have placed these

1539
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,020
device for sampling or observing

1540
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,620
just mentioned

1541
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,920
with meteorological heat hazards

1542
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,920
Actually other words

1543
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,520
All are air pollutants

1544
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,420
including solarizations like this

1545
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,820
Here are some precursors of pn2.5

1546
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,960
Then pn2.5 still has ergodic distribution

1547
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,620
And then there's black charcoal, which is toxic to health

1548
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,000
And how cold is the direction to listen to this or something like this

1549
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
monitor

1550
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:36,820
That's just

1551
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:38,020
then we still have

1552
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,820
Use this green paper to collect samples for component analysis

1553
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,020
However, these component analyzes take a lot of time to do.

1554
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:45,220
this analysis

1555
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,320
So today's words are not

1556
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,120
You have a way to report this data to everyone

1557
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,120
ok so let's go first

1558
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,220
look again

1559
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,320
Our definition of overhang

1560
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:58,720
Why do we care so much about this so-called pn2.5

1561
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,220
ok

1562
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:00,440
this pn2.5

1563
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,560
PM's words refer to suspension as force

1564
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:06,760
PM refers to the force of particle size less than 10 microns

1565
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,280
We don't care if it is greater than 10

1566
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,600
why

1567
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,320
Because our nose hairs keep them out

1568
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,720
So progress greater than 10 comes

1569
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,000
unless

1570
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,160
unless you run

1571
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,120
desperately open mouth to breathe

1572
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,640
At this time he may come in from your rouge

1573
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,120
OK

1574
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,120
Otherwise it won't get into your nose

1575
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,000
So we don't care if it is greater than 10

1576
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,720
from a health point of view

1577
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,280
That

1578
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,120
Larger than 10 microns will come in

1579
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,960
affects our upper respiratory tract

1580
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,760
but only smaller than 2.5 microns

1581
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,320
can be implanted into our lung cannon

1582
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:41,760
deep in the lungs

1583
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,240
Then it depends on what kind of pollutants he has

1584
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,080
what effect will it have on us

1585
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,640
He is more able to penetrate our body

1586
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,720
and accumulate over there

1587
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,920
long-term impact on us as a whole

1588
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,320
that some words are

1589
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,520
This acute irritant

1590
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,480
like acid flu

1591
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,960
That's something like listening in the cold direction

1592
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,240
He is spontaneous

1593
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,800
And some if it's heavy metal

1594
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,480
he is bad for nerves

1595
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
So he sees what his ingredients are

1596
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
have different effects on our body

1597
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
This is why I care so much about PN2.5

1598
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Source words of PN2.5

1599
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's not all man made.

1600
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
some are of natural origin

1601
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
So that's why the World Health Organization

1602
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
his annual

1603
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
The recommended value for the annual average is 10 meters

1604
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
per cubic meter

1605
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
he didn't book zero

1606
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
because even if no one is there

1607
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
In fact, nature still has

1608
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Man-made, of course, is factory emissions

1609
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Combustion activities Automobiles etc.

1610
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
If distinguished by the process of the itinerary

1611
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
He can also be divided into

1612
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Suspected pollutants discharged directly from the source

1613
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
directly from the drain

1614
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Including factory emissions, automobile and motorcycle emissions

1615
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Kitchen fumes are directly discharged

1616
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
some air pollutants

1617
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
When discharged, it is a gas

1618
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
But he has undergone some photochemical reactions

1619
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
after some action

1620
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
The prize of the itinerary

1621
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
This is from the secondary

1622
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
We call it secondary pollutant

1623
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
after some process

1624
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Pollutants emitted directly by

1625
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
after some process

1626
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
becomes an example

1627
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
So PL2.5 is so difficult to control

1628
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
It is because it has the process of secondary pollutants

1629
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So even if we regulate pollutants once

1630
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
We still control many of its precursors

1631
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
only valid

1632
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Otherwise it keeps generating this

1633
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
generate this secondary pollutant

1634
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
this is our asia

1635
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But say this is global

1636
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
2010 to 2012

1637
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Three-year global average of this PL2.5

1638
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
It can be seen that the Asian region is particularly red

1639
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Just mentioned the World Health Organization

1640
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The suggested value for the annual average is

1641
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Ten Dimensional Meters

1642
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
What about the Asian region?

1643
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
It's possible to get to this 80 to 100

1644
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
What about the three-year average?

1645
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
80 to 100 dimension meters

1646
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
victor cubic meter

1647
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
OK very high

1648
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Of course it's also because of the Asian region

1649
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
The economy has been booming in recent years

1650
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
this

1651
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
and it may be

1652
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,600
The control of the factory is not so strict

1653
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,100
What about Taiwan?

1654
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,000
In the case of Taiwan, the Environmental Protection Agency has also made great efforts.

1655
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,300
This air pollutant in Taiwan

1656
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,800
For example, sulfur dioxide

1657
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,720
it is also this

1658
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,200
A precursor of PN2.5

1659
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,500
sulfur dioxide

1660
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,300
PN10 or PN2.5

1661
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,800
In fact, there is a downward trend

1662
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,800
So the EPA is not doing nothing

1663
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,800
it does a lot of things

1664
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,500
Only then can such a decline be caused

1665
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,900
But what is everyone unhappy about now?

1666
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,200
not happy

1667
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,800
because the World Health Organization says

1668
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,600
The annual average should be only ten meters

1669
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,800
Ten is Kemei local factory

1670
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,600
But we can't come down yet

1671
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,100
ok our current words

1672
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,600
Probably only the east is barely this

1673
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,200
The average annual

1674
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,300
just under ten

1675
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,300
Otherwise, it is probably this

1676
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,600
3 40

1677
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,600
It's even lower in recent years

1678
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
about 2 30

1679
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,100
ok

1680
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,800
That's because PN2.5 is considered a human carcinogen by the World Health Organization

1681
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,600
so words

1682
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,000
That's why everyone cares so much

1683
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
will hope to be able to lower and lower

1684
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,500
Then let me mention it here

1685
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,500
Even after ambient concentrations drop

1686
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,000
doesn't mean the front of your nose

1687
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,500
Exposure concentrations dropped below 10 microns

1688
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,000
OK

1689
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,500
Because of this exposure concentration

1690
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,000
It's the concentration in front of my nose

1691
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
with the one they were testing

1692
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
10 meters or more

1693
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
The EPA's measurements are usually above 10 meters

1694
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,500
It measures the uniform mixture of a city

1695
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,000
concentration of air pollutants

1696
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Its purpose is to compare

1697
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,500
Is Taipei City better this year than last year?

1698
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:36,500
Or compare it with Taipei City, Taichung, and Kaohsiung this year

1699
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,500
which city is better

1700
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,500
do it like this

1701
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,000
so it's all evenly mixed

1702
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
in front of our noses

1703
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Probably especially this one in Asia

1704
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,500
In the community we just talked about

1705
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,000
so many different sources of pollution

1706
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,500
OK

1707
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,000
including cars like this one

1708
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,500
discharge this temple directly

1709
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,500
Or a small factory in the catering industry, etc.

1710
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,500
If these are directly discharged

1711
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,000
will cause us more

1712
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
the exposure concentration

1713
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Exposure density

1714
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,800
Let's take a look at how this pollutant will cause health and economic damage.

1715
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,400
Of course, our current industry or environmental protection policies will cause some pollution sources

1716
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,440
Then what happens after these pollution sources are discharged?

1717
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,840
After conversion, it will form the surrounding environment concentration just mentioned

1718
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,440
Then this week, if the environmental concentration is going to affect our health

1719
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,080
we must be able to say

1720
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,640
This creates our external concentration

1721
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,880
we sucked in

1722
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,040
The nose will inhale in order to affect our health

1723
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,480
Can't suck in

1724
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,320
won't come in

1725
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,160
All will not affect our health

1726
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,760
So the most important thing is actually the body's external concentration

1727
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,320
The EPA is testing

1728
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:43,240
In fact, it is the surrounding concentration of pollutants

1729
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,240
It's actually like I just mentioned

1730
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,600
It is not equal to the present concentration outside the human body

1731
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,680
Extrinsic concentration of the human body

1732
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:54,840
In fact, this is not easy to measure

1733
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,360
I don't know if you have ever visited the EPA's test war

1734
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,560
About six or seven pollutants

1735
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,320
It needs to fill a small room with a size of seven to ten pings

1736
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,720
Different instruments and some cylinders

1737
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,720
OK

1738
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,040
so you can imagine

1739
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,400
You have to measure the front of your nose

1740
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,920
you can't take an instrument

1741
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,240
Hold a cylinder and keep going

1742
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:15,920
right

1743
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,560
So to measure this dangerous concentration

1744
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,720
It's not easy

1745
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,440
So it needs a portable observation instrument

1746
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,720
to measure

1747
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,680
Then this portable observation instrument

1748
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:26,800
good enough

1749
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,480
for scientific purposes

1750
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:29,120
OK

1751
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,280
So this is what we were doing before

1752
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,000
When this external dangerous concentration

1753
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,840
a big challenge

1754
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,880
then one more word

1755
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,280
we should mention that

1756
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,960
In fact, the dangerous concentration of the human body

1757
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,520
because we are close

1758
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,640
including when we cook

1759
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,840
including when we lose

1760
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,640
including before we ride a motorcycle

1761
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,160
When a car emits black smoke

1762
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,760
what we inhaled

1763
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,400
Actually a cutting-edge concentration

1764
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,760
What about the tip concentration?

1765
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,840
EPA is undetectable

1766
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,400
Because it's gone in an instant

1767
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,000
OK

1768
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,960
Therefore, the freshness measured by the concentration of Jannain

1769
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,260
What about the concentration of the fresh pollutants it emits?

1770
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,760
or this ingredient

1771
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:08,460
OK

1772
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:14,360
It is also different from the evenly mixed composition measured by the Environmental Protection Agency.

1773
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,600
OK because it's been hours

1774
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,200
OK

1775
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,040
So the composition is different and the concentration is not the same

1776
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,200
so it actually

1777
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,440
If we use the concentration of the surrounding environment to represent the concentration we don't like

1778
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,560
Many things behind are misleading

1779
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,000
including it would be misleading

1780
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
our this

1781
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,400
how to measure us

1782
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,000
The effect of actual damage to health

1783
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Health Effect OK

1784
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,400
health damage factor

1785
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,600
this is misleading

1786
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,200
that especially in

1787
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,600
With so many sources of pollution in this community in Taiwan

1788
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,800
it may

1789
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,200
more misleading

1790
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,600
Let's take a look at

1791
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,900
In fact, even in Europe and the United States

1792
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,900
Europe and the United States do not have such complex community pollution sources as ours

1793
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,100
Europe and the United States are relatively simple

1794
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,900
Europe and the United States often say that

1795
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,900
whatever it is

1796
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,240
Probably the concentration of PM2.5 in my backyard

1797
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,800
OK, if their family didn't mention some other sources of pollution

1798
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,000
Like this fast frying and so on

1799
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,640
probably that's about it

1800
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,200
but even so

1801
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,240
let's take a look

1802
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,440
If the ambient concentration is used to represent the acceptable concentration

1803
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,640
We underestimate the health damage of pollutants

1804
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,160
This is a well-known one or two studies in the United States

1805
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,360
This is American Cancer Research

1806
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:27,960
there is a famous author

1807
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,600
He is using urban monitoring stations to represent the concentration of people in the whole city

1808
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,200
The result he got was

1809
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,240
10 wick per rise

1810
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,240
PM2.5 per cubic meter

1811
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,960
His overall death rate will increase by 6%

1812
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,600
OK up 6%

1813
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,160
that same one

1814
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:50,240
population in the same cancer cohort

1815
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,560
this study

1816
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,520
But different researchers

1817
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,120
He used a nearby monitoring station

1818
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,760
and he took into account different traffic flows

1819
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,160
That is, different areas have different traffic flows.

1820
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Use such a more detailed method to estimate the population of the people

1821
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
exposure concentration

1822
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
what did he get

1823
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Every rise of 10 victoria meters

1824
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
The overall death rate will increase by 17%

1825
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000
That is 3 times higher

1826
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
This is 3 times higher

1827
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It is because his exposure concentration estimation is more accurate

1828
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
What about this estimate?

1829
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Also with the other one in Europe is also using

1830
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It is also a more accurate way of land return

1831
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,000
To estimate the concentration of exposure

1832
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
The estimated 13% is relatively close

1833
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
OK

1834
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
So scientifically speaking

1835
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
How can we get more accurate

1836
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Exposure concentration is a very, very important issue

1837
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Because science is basically about finding the truth.

1838
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
We have the closest true exposure concentration value

1839
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
We can compare to estimate

1840
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
More accurate this P2.5

1841
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
How does it harm your health?

1842
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
At present, these large-scale studies in Europe and the United States

1843
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Basically they're talking about long-term exposure to pollutants

1844
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
long-term bleeding

1845
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Damage factor for long-term chronic health damage to health

1846
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
for acute injuries

1847
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
including what we just mentioned

1848
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Emissions from cars and locomotives in front

1849
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
or when we cook

1850
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Exposure to higher concentrations

1851
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Such an exposure when I like barbecue on Mid-Autumn Festival

1852
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
What is the harm to our own health?

1853
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Now, very little is known

1854
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
because of technical limitations

1855
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Fortunately, it is also because in recent years

1856
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Especially the technical limitations in the past two years

1857
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Our future is likely to be in this area

1858
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
in the assessment of acute health effects

1859
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
can make better progress

1860
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:58,000
This is also the direction our research team wants to work on in the future

1861
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
ok let's see

1862
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,460
We have been talking about the prevention and treatment of kidney stasis

1863
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:07,760
So in the middle of something like this

1864
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,240
What in this process

1865
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:13,640
is the point of entry where we can intervene policy

1866
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,840
If we have better industrial and environmental protection policies

1867
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,380
In terms of environmental governance

1868
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:20,080
We will reduce a lot of pollution sources

1869
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,520
that's the best, right?

1870
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,080
Prevention of Kidney Stasis Treatment

1871
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,080
Or you discharge pollutants

1872
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,280
But I figured out how to prevent pollution from it

1873
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,680
catch you

1874
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,640
OK this is OK

1875
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,440
But there is no 100% pollution in the world

1876
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,940
100% pollution control equipment that can be caught

1877
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,240
once it's discharged

1878
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,140
The next one that can protect our health

1879
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,280
That is, how do we think of ways to block this exposure channel?

1880
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,880
so even in the air

1881
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,920
But we won't be exposed to this

1882
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,120
then we'll be safe

1883
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,120
ok this is next

1884
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,420
So these three points

1885
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,480
Basically, policy can intervene

1886
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,260
Points to reduce health risks

1887
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,000
Then our scientific problem is actually

1888
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
We want to know what the actual risk concentration of the people is

1889
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
What kind of impact factor does that have?

1890
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Are there potential sources of neglected pollutants?

1891
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
we forget we ignore

1892
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Then there is how we can block this dangerous path

1893
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So can protect our health

1894
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
This is what we did in Taiwan

1895
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
This is a 400-meter community

1896
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Then we take the instrument

1897
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Walk along this street for about an hour and a half

1898
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
You can see that its concentration is three times different

1899
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Concentrations can be three times higher in some places with polluting source community sources

1900
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
This is what we call community pollution

1901
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
The impact of community emission sources on the concentration of human hazards

1902
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It will also have an impact on the air quality of our communities

1903
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
So in Asia

1904
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,400
In fact, Europe and the United States are really different

1905
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,100
We are not only subject to

1906
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,100
Influence of surrounding environment concentration

1907
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,200
OK Our Personal Concentration

1908
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,200
environment

1909
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,000
Coupled with these increases in community emission sources

1910
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:15,500
coupled with our individual behavior

1911
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:17,300
including if you are going to smoke

1912
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:20,100
OK or cooking or doing any activity

1913
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,600
This is generated by pumping this self

1914
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:26,700
So what is the concentration of each of us?

1915
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,300
In fact, it is a combination of these three

1916
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:30,800
OK put together

1917
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,500
so which one is more

1918
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,000
that is, not everyone

1919
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:37,800
what about our team

1920
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,000
It's not always a survey

1921
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,300
as if we researched this

1922
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,300
How high are you this time, how low will you be next time

1923
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:46,000
it's over

1924
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,200
not like this

1925
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,000
we're talking about forever

1926
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,300
What is the factor

1927
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,400
will affect the concentration of the waterfall

1928
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,500
Then what is the emission of this waterfall?

1929
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,700
What is the increase in emissions

1930
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,000
What is the emission factor

1931
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,800
After having these

1932
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,760
In order to draw all these data together

1933
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,500
Then on the one hand, it is possible to estimate more precisely

1934
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:06,960
Our Risk Concentration

1935
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,120
So we can calculate

1936
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,000
to study our health damage coefficient

1937
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,260
it's a purpose

1938
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,360
one more word

1939
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,100
More importantly, we can also put

1940
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,520
this factor of this risk

1941
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,420
add up to one of us

1942
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:22,500
what we call catastrophe mode

1943
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,060
OK

1944
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,520
So in the future, this waterfall mode

1945
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,860
we can use

1946
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:29,020
Do a lot of other science above this discussion

1947
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,600
ok let's see

1948
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,320
We are curious in this land

1949
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,460
Are we usually in the community?

1950
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,160
how to go around

1951
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:38,720
OK

1952
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,160
Let me show you here

1953
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:42,320
This is what we worked hard for

1954
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,860
The assistant and the student

1955
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,800
It's really just a push cart

1956
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,220
He has a very precise instrument on it.

1957
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:50,300
OK detour along the community

1958
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,720
and he can't go too fast

1959
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,860
OK he has to walk slowly

1960
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,900
So in very hot conditions

1961
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,260
if you see this girl

1962
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,200
Still wearing this visor hat

1963
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,760
If this girl is on the side of the road

1964
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,840
We also need to register some, including cars and motorcycles passing by the roadside

1965
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,600
He has to count, he has to do a lot of record work

1966
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,360
Only by recording it like this can we know

1967
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,000
Which factors will emit how much pollution increase

1968
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,040
Some passers-by will also be curious

1969
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,480
so what are we doing

1970
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,280
And then we'll all tell him we're measuring the air quality

1971
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,920
Then he said good very good

1972
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,280
We really need you to test this air quality

1973
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,520
like this this car goes by

1974
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:32,200
This is actually when ordinary people are waiting for the red jade lantern.

1975
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,960
will stay at this intersection

1976
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:35,600
OK this is all in the alley

1977
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,480
we are simulating words

1978
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,680
In fact, we also saw old people who were about our height

1979
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,560
He rides this car, do you have electric cars?

1980
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,320
when he is walking or the baby is in the stroller

1981
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,320
are also so high

1982
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,600
So we are also simulating the actual

1983
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,960
when people actually do these everyday things

1984
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,640
The exposure concentration of

1985
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,600
Then we also explore the factor behind him

1986
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,040
This is a video of our live

1987
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,620
In fact, our personal PM2.5 concentration

1988
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,340
technology over the years

1989
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:10,400
Great progress has been made in the analysis of this observation technique

1990
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,340
We're going to have a pump before new year's

1991
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:16,500
Connect a sampling head to pump air

1992
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,300
So we're going to pump air with a filter paper in it

1993
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,180
So you can accumulate PM2.5

1994
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:25,900
Its advantage is that this filter paper can also be used for chemical analysis later

1995
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:28,740
will analyze some ingredients that are harmful to health

1996
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,980
its downside is

1997
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:32,660
I actually took this myself

1998
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,180
This set is about 2.5 kg

1999
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,940
You will think that this 2.5 kg is nothing

2000
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:38,780
right

2001
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,400
It also vibrates a little bit

2002
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,920
You'll feel like the first five minutes are nothing

2003
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,020
You'll know after you vibrate it for half an hour

2004
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,180
It vibrated to the point where I couldn't do anything else that day

2005
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:49,780
i can only watch tv

2006
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:50,680
you can't think

2007
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,500
Because it just doesn't work and keeps vibrating inside

2008
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,900
and it's going to be a little bit noisy

2009
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,340
that noise too

2010
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,800
The first five minutes you thought it was okay

2011
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,100
then wait until half an hour

2012
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Then I started to feel unbearable

2013
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
So we're also grateful for the years

2014
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,500
The assistants and volunteers who helped us bring these observation instruments

2015
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,700
Then they have to take 4 hours to 24 hours

2016
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,800
OK take so long before we can collect enough

2017
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
to do chemical analysis

2018
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,800
OK this was 20 years ago

2019
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,000
Then I came to Academia Sinica

2020
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,200
So I am very grateful that Academia Sinica has money to support

2021
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,200
We bought a western belt for this

2022
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:30,200
The particle regime instrument

2023
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,200
It is possible to measure this particle size distribution

2024
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,200
Also includes PN2.5

2025
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,200
This is about two to three kilograms

2026
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,200
OK but because it's too expensive

2027
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,200
So we can only sell these two sets

2028
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:44,700
And it was brought by my assistant

2029
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,200
We dare not bring volunteers

2030
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,200
Because if it hits

2031
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,200
We're about to pass out

2032
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,200
OK, then we can collect one piece of data per minute

2033
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:58,200
Now, we are cooperating with the teachers of the information center

2034
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,200
So now it has developed like this

2035
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Simple, this one is only 200 grams

2036
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
it is paired with a

2037
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
mobile power bank

2038
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Then it can also be equipped with temperature and humidity inside

2039
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Then this GPS and Wi-Fi, it can transmit wirelessly

2040
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
There is also an SD card, which can save its data

2041
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
There can be a data every 15 seconds

2042
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
So if the instrument of research like now

2043
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
We can study more later

2044
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
The client's liability, and the acute liability

2045
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
relationship with health effects

2046
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
This is what we designed this year

2047
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
we started early

2048
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
we were in 1999

2049
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
We are actually in six communities in the north, central and south

2050
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
to recruit volunteers

2051
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Thank you to the five or sixty volunteers

2052
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Willing to wear a sampler like this

2053
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Wear it 24 hours a day

2054
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
when they wear

2055
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
They also help us fill out questionnaires

2056
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,800
He just told us every 30 minutes

2057
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,600
Was he indoors or outdoors at that time?

2058
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,000
Is there any source of pollution near him?

2059
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,200
including someone smoking

2060
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,700
There is this car exhaust

2061
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,500
There is this family setting off firecrackers

2062
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,300
what are these details

2063
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,400
then what is he doing

2064
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,700
he is riding a motorcycle

2065
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,400
still here

2066
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,400
do any of this activity

2067
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,100
ok watching tv and so on

2068
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:26,000
That's because we need this schedule of his activities

2069
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,400
to be able to analyze

2070
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,000
Why on earth do some people have high concentration

2071
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,600
Some people have lower concentrations

2072
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,100
Because we can only accumulate one data in 24 hours

2073
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,500
ok at that time

2074
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,300
What about this research?

2075
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,300
actually very very important

2076
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:41,100
This is the first in Taiwan

2077
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:43,300
This is actually in the community

2078
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,400
See this study on particulate exposure

2079
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,000
Then he is targeting PM10

2080
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,300
At that time, there was no PM2.5

2081
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,400
What about this study?

2082
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,700
In fact, this electric

2083
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,700
The basis of my future research

2084
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,200
he pointed out two

2085
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,400
In fact, in European and American studies

2086
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,200
rarely pointed out

2087
01:21:59,200 --> 01:21:59,800
First

2088
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,400
Research tells us that indoor air quality

2089
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:08,000
Concentrations of pollutants are higher indoors than outdoors

2090
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Because Europe and the United States donâ€™t care if they have cats and dogs at home

2091
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,500
Because of the carpet or something

2092
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:19,000
Although they are not decorated with high heat, quick fry or burn incense

2093
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
But their indoor concentration is really relatively high

2094
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,500
Indoor is higher than outdoor

2095
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,000
we are the opposite

2096
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
We are higher outdoor than indoor

2097
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
At first, I felt a little bit unconvinced.

2098
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I later discussed with other researchers in public health

2099
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
They said that the few cases they tested were actually like this

2100
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
what does that mean

2101
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
This means that we are actually too dirty outside.

2102
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,000
OK

2103
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
real

2104
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
OK because we really have a lot of community pollution sources outdoors

2105
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
This is why it continued to be a source of community pollution.

2106
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Because it is from the outdoors of the community

2107
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
it passes

2108
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
because you don't care how it closes the window

2109
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
it just has air exchange

2110
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
it comes from outside to inside

2111
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
OK will affect the indoor air quality

2112
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
very different

2113
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Second point

2114
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Actually doing this abroad

2115
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
powerless personal exposure

2116
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
personal exposure

2117
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
maybe make it out

2118
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
main conclusion

2119
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
It may be that people who smoke have a higher concentration

2120
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
probably their most important one

2121
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
The exposure factor is this

2122
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
but we make it

2123
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Like the 50 or so people I recruited

2124
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Actually they don't smoke

2125
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
the non-smoker

2126
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
But they have different

2127
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
This exposed behavior

2128
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
will make their concentration

2129
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Individual concentration is higher than others

2130
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
the most obvious

2131
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
What about this exposed behavior?

2132
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
the first motorcycle

2133
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
biker outside

2134
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
He's just taller than a guy who doesn't ride a bike

2135
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
he average

2136
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
his concentration words

2137
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
High exposure concentration of 20 gram

2138
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
per cubic meter

2139
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
In addition, people who are slightly defeated are also

2140
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,000
and the ones in the kitchen

2141
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
stay in the kitchen

2142
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
not my own cooking

2143
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Because we all asked him about this activity

2144
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
it's him in the kitchen

2145
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
with his wife or his mother

2146
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
this chat

2147
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
His negative risk concentration will be high

2148
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And these households actually have range hoods for driving

2149
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
ok, but his negative risk concentration will still be relatively high

2150
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
there is another

2151
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
It is time to pass the small community factory

2152
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
ok because we have too many Taiwan

2153
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
weird little factory

2154
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Our so-called small factories are actually a lot of traffickers

2155
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Like this motorcycle repair shop, small carpenter, etc.

2156
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
The shop and business of metal, etc. are all

2157
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
ok after these

2158
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
he didn't go in he just passed by

2159
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
he will be taller

2160
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
ok, so these, these, and this information

2161
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
that's why we will

2162
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Research this community pollution source

2163
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
ok now a quick word on this

2164
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Everyone in Asia knows this

2165
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
we are all around

2166
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
we because we like to have

2167
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
good life function

2168
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Our family can eat a lot of this car

2169
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Gongmiao, this hair salon

2170
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
wait for the night market

2171
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
ok

2172
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Then these words will emit these pn2.5

2173
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
some are direct emissions

2174
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It also does not require secondary pollution

2175
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
It emits a lot of direct emissions

2176
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Then this is our community

2177
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Actually use the more expensive one

2178
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
instrument to do

2179
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Gongmiao next to the catering industry

2180
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
beside

2181
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Most people wait for the work toilet to see

2182
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
After all, these will cause

2183
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
How much concentration increments do we

2184
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
then we also

2185
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
This is one of the materials

2186
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
this is to see this

2187
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
This filter distributes

2188
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
That's 0.1 microns and all the way up to 100

2189
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
so we can see

2190
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
The words behind are background points

2191
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
very light color

2192
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
The word before that is the catering industry

2193
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
So we can know the words of the restaurant industry

2194
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
it is

2195
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Possibly larger filters

2196
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
or emit into very, very small filters

2197
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
The words of Gongmiao

2198
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Almost the emissions are exactly what we breathe

2199
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It is like this below pn2.5

2200
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
this range

2201
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The emission from the factory site is relatively large.

2202
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
filter range

2203
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,020
From these we can see that comparing

2204
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:05,540
Emission sources in this different community

2205
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,300
The vili that was released was actually

2206
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,100
Different circumstances

2207
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:12,940
In addition, we can also use this statistical method

2208
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:15,360
How to analyze data

2209
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,640
These catering industry with oily fumes

2210
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,940
Temple construction site etc.

2211
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,640
All for our PN2.5

2212
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,400
Wait, there is this obvious contribution

2213
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:31,900
Then everyone probably in the past five years or

2214
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:33,920
Only noticed in the past week or two

2215
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,660
This temple minus this thing

2216
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:38,820
In fact, because I made this incense-related

2217
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,920
This study has been done for more than ten years

2218
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,120
So I actually spent the past few years in this

2219
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,760
do these studies

2220
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,520
I was also invited to this

2221
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:51,260
Like last year, there were two chances to go to Central

2222
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:54,220
This is the local religious group

2223
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:56,120
They are spontaneous to promote

2224
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:58,120
Events at Eco-friendly Temples

2225
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,200
Really try to use self-management as much as possible

2226
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,840
Minimize

2227
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,540
So we've actually seen over the years

2228
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,900
They're really pushing the same box

2229
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,540
When I used to do

2230
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:13,340
In fact, some are like three incense sticks or more

2231
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,040
OK

2232
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,740
So they really have this

2233
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:18,080
tried my best

2234
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,580
Of course the EPA is also kind

2235
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:22,740
Because it is true that when you burn incense and fail

2236
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:24,080
you hold it in front of your nose

2237
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,500
So you are this about your health

2238
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,500
Your invisibility is very high

2239
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,940
OK is bad for your health

2240
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,340
so good intentions on both sides

2241
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:32,640
But in the end this

2242
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:33,940
There may be some misunderstandings in the middle

2243
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:34,640
OK

2244
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,940
Well, I've been talking to this environmental group over the years

2245
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:39,000
or a religious group

2246
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,180
when this interaction

2247
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:41,700
Learned a lot from them

2248
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,440
the first they also say

2249
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,180
This proverb says

2250
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:47,980
Burning incense from fortune telling

2251
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:50,440
OK, why is it that the one who pays burns incense?

2252
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,740
Because the incense used to be very expensive

2253
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:55,640
They are all made with very precious traditional Chinese medicine.

2254
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,740
So it burns out very

2255
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:00,080
This is very fragrant and comfortable

2256
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Not now, now there are a lot of annual plans to study medicine

2257
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
In fact, if it burns out, it is very likely that there will be a lot of sperm and eggs

2258
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I myself have done research on the direction of cancer treatment, and analyzed it

2259
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Then other scholars have also made it, and you have burned heavy metals

2260
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
This is all published in the literature

2261
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So the fragrance of the past is different from the fragrance of the present

2262
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
In addition, the refinement of the past is not the same as the refinement of the present.

2263
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
The one in the middle of the previous exquisiteness is Xibo

2264
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Now the middle is plastic, what will the plastic burn out

2265
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
We all know, waist type

2266
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
So this is where there are many differences between the past and the present

2267
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,000
But these religious groups are actually trying to do

2268
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
These are the words of the local faith center

2269
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
We also selected these two recent reports

2270
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
In fact, it also shows that these religious groups

2271
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000
They are actually very considerate of everyone.

2272
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,000
For example, when passing the examinee's place, he is forbidden to become

2273
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,760
Bubble and loudspeaker while playing

2274
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,320
let the grill suffer

2275
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,820
Or when Mazu is oily

2276
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,100
Also do not let the side soak along the way

2277
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,280
They are also promoting environmental protection

2278
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,840
concept of health

2279
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,500
I have been from 1999 to now

2280
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,100
I did a series of

2281
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,640
There are experiments related to burning incense

2282
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,320
including watching in the lab

2283
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,400
different edema

2284
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:26,740
It's burned out PN2.5

2285
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,440
Shout out to the Fragrance Hall

2286
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:30,440
Then we are in this

2287
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,880
Xiangke at home

2288
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,580
defeat every day or

2289
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:35,680
go to temple every month

2290
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:36,640
or this

2291
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,440
When talking about Mazu looking in the mirror

2292
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,720
what are they

2293
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:40,480
how much exposure

2294
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,180
What else is this impact factor

2295
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:42,780
OK

2296
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,680
then i emphasize

2297
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,480
have always been

2298
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,980
controllable factors

2299
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:46,780
what factor

2300
01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:49,380
can help him reduce his risk concentration

2301
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,080
I've been telling this student

2302
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,040
or when people communicate

2303
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,180
speaking

2304
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,920
our purpose

2305
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,140
I hope to say how to go

2306
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,140
keep the tradition

2307
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Folk while reducing health risks

2308
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
In fact, that's what I told the gods

2309
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
when i go to the temple to do it

2310
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I must first worship the gods

2311
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And speak to him very reverently

2312
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I'm not trying to change folklore beliefs

2313
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I hope everyone engages in the same folk beliefs when

2314
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
How to reduce the risk to your health

2315
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So most of the gods agree that I am in the temple

2316
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Do observations like this

2317
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
only one did not agree

2318
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I asked three times and he still didn't agree

2319
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I just thank him

2320
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I'm leaving

2321
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,000
that's all

2322
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:38,000
so we just respect

2323
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
events like temples

2324
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
So like I would suggest

2325
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
When everyone is burning incense

2326
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
The first must be ventilated

2327
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
of course we all know

2328
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Telescope with censer

2329
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
will also affect the concentration of the waterfall

2330
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But ventilation is the most important

2331
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
It doesn't matter if you're close to him as long as it's ventilated

2332
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
The concentration of ventilation can be as bad as

2333
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
seven or eight times more

2334
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Xiangzhi tree, Xianglulu, etc. used in temples

2335
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Or when Dajia Matsu circled in

2336
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
For everyone, it is better to take this kind of big bus.

2337
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Otherwise, you will directly ride a motorcycle and be directly exposed to more serious

2338
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
These are controllable factors

2339
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
In addition, we also want to talk about this walking and jumping night market

2340
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
This is actually my favorite night market.

2341
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
This night market is not the night market on the promotional materials

2342
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
it's different

2343
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Another word is because our data is made with sensors

2344
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
So it hasn't been corrected by this science

2345
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:44,000
It's just that there is a trend now that I can show it to everyone

2346
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
If we're here, we're entering a palace

2347
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Its concentration will increase a lot

2348
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
then we passed a lot of kebab places

2349
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Yakiniku stand, chicken cutlet

2350
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
or charcoal grilled milk

2351
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
This rise is most pronounced

2352
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,000
OK

2353
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,740
There are three leading military systems here

2354
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:03,700
I'm actually about five meters away from them.

2355
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:04,740
In fact, it will also affect

2356
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:06,340
we know how serious

2357
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,280
And these like passing through the incense burner or the convenience store

2358
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,040
Wait in the underground parking lot

2359
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,440
There are also such

2360
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,840
There is this obvious pick out

2361
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,080
So in the future we will have a smaller one like this

2362
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:22,080
some sensor words

2363
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,680
can help us do more

2364
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,180
this

2365
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:25,480
Then this actually helps

2366
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,680
Ordinary people to understand his daily life

2367
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:29,500
What kind of situation will it break into?

2368
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,000
it can change its behavior instantly

2369
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,500
then reduce its risk

2370
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,700
So this is our cooperation with the Information Office

2371
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,340
Now there is a small

2372
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,800
A portable version of the tiny sensor

2373
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,500
This tiny sensor could also be added to the street

2374
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,840
with solar panels

2375
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:50,340
can then be transferred instantly to our database

2376
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,380
Even we have an indoor sensor like this

2377
01:32:53,380 --> 01:32:53,900
OK

2378
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,300
The sensors in this room are also

2379
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,740
The data can be viewed online in real time

2380
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,140
At present, we have placed more than a dozen families

2381
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
This is in a certain house

2382
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
After months of data collection

2383
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Also found A strange

2384
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Why does he have a fixed number of peaks every day

2385
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Spike concentrations of two or three

2386
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Later I found out that he has the habit of offering incense in the morning and evening

2387
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
And he cooks at home too

2388
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
So we reminded him right away

2389
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
He's very glad we reminded him

2390
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
This aunt also asked us later

2391
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
How can I reduce his concentration during this goodbye?

2392
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We just reminded him to open the doors and windows

2393
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
So his concentration dropped a lot later

2394
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
So this is what I think these tiny sensors

2395
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
possible future development

2396
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
is to remind everyone to change their behavior

2397
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
reduce your health risks

2398
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
If we still hope in the future

2399
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It is for this urban traffic flow

2400
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
This is a collaboration with Mr. Fengyuan and the others

2401
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
They have very good image recognition technology

2402
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
traffic in the community

2403
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I think it must be an important factor causing the increase in pollution in this community

2404
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Because there is no such good technology

2405
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
used to use very expensive cameras

2406
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
to analyze

2407
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Now their technology can be used in general

2408
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Everyone sees the police station hanging on the street

2409
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,000
or a government camera

2410
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:23,000
You can analyze the direction of the car

2411
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And it can identify the car type

2412
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Of course, this actually has many challenges.

2413
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
including say it you see there are so many different intersections

2414
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
it has a different turn

2415
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
How to use a computer to directly identify

2416
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Big cars and small cars can also be identified very well

2417
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
it has some shadowing due to the low angle

2418
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
So it's a bad situation

2419
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
But otherwise

2420
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I think generally speaking, it is to analyze the traffic flow.

2421
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
is well analyzed

2422
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,000
In the future, we will cooperate with our observers on the street

2423
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
So we are not afraid that this service company is lying to us

2424
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
We'll then be able to actually

2425
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Know the increase in emissions of vehicles that are not driving and the factors of emissions

2426
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
OK

2427
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,500
So if we do these emission factors and so on

2428
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:12,500
I hope it can be accumulated in our exposure mode in the future

2429
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,000
OK

2430
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:17,800
Well, here's the stuff we've done over the years

2431
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,000
Atmospheric

2432
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
this

2433
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,800
On weekends, I'd better go to the suburbs for a walk

2434
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,800
Because it is true that the concentration in the suburbs is relatively low

2435
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,800
That secondhand smoke is the scariest

2436
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,900
OK so try not to smoke this one

2437
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,900
And after smoking your

2438
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,900
The cilia in this lung will stop

2439
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,900
30 minutes of inactivity

2440
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,900
In other words, all your

2441
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,900
All the dirt on the outside tends to get implanted deep in your lungs

2442
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:42,900
OK

2443
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,900
so this can

2444
01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:46,900
Tell your smoking friends

2445
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:48,900
ask them to smoke as little as possible

2446
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,900
Okay, the last mention is to say

2447
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,900
In fact, it's not just the researchers who are very concerned about this PLO question.

2448
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:55,900
In fact, some civic groups

2449
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:57,900
They also spontaneously put this

2450
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,900
I cooperate with information agency

2451
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,600
The prototype of a sensor developed by Mr. Lin Zhi and the others

2452
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,400
after they improved

2453
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,800
There are also some private companies willing to mass produce

2454
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,800
Cooperate with some municipal governments, etc.

2455
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,900
This is one of the airborne sensor network

2456
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:20,600
A Cooperative Mechanism of Industry, Government and Academia

2457
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,400
I also invited experts from European and American countries two weeks ago

2458
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,200
they were also surprised

2459
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,900
It is our air carrier sensor network in Taiwan

2460
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,300
This has accumulated to more than 2,000 sensors in the province

2461
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:33,300
Although he still has some accuracy problems

2462
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:39,100
But this can be improved by scientific correction

2463
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:46,100
Finally, I would like to thank the hospital for this sustainable

2464
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,100
Most of what I just reported was

2465
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:51,600
A collaborative effort of this sustainable project

2466
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,200
This is a cross-disciplinary team

2467
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,600
Thanks to my partners

2468
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,800
We also want to say something about the results of our sustainable projects

2469
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,860
There can be some parts that can be used as a reference for government units

2470
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:07,760
and can be translated into policy

2471
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,260
able to actually help everyone

2472
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,200
Can reduce health risks

2473
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:13,500
protect our health

2474
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,500
thank you all

2475
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,000
Thanks

2476
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,400
Thank you, Mr. Long, very brilliant

2477
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:26,300
This introduction to 2D Hygan PM2.5

2478
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,160
now we have time left

2479
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,660
we're going to be open to questions

2480
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:35,020
If you ask questions today

2481
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:43,320
We have a copy of the current issue of Scientific Man here

2482
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,060
because there is an article in it

2483
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:48,920
Then give it to the friend who asked the question

2484
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,220
we have seven on site

2485
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:54,920
So the first seven people can get this magazine

2486
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:57,720
If there are other problems later

2487
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,320
we don't have it right now

2488
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,320
just wait

2489
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,900
Please register with the staff when you go out

2490
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:05,720
We just have questions today

2491
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:09,940
We'll deliver the magazine to you again

2492
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:12,700
ok , thanks then , one of you to start

2493
01:38:14,940 --> 01:38:16,860
Excuse me

2494
01:38:18,700 --> 01:38:20,900
where is it

2495
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:22,900
because I looked

2496
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:26,100
That thermal power plant in Taiwan

2497
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,100
That PM2.5

2498
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:33,500
Can you tell us about his numerical value?

2499
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:40,300
Do you mean the data he released?

2500
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:41,800
This will probably go to the EPA

2501
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,100
What he said about the chimneys of thermal power plants

2502
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,000
They all have a direct

2503
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,500
one...

2504
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,300
You say it is an observation instrument

2505
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,400
What he is observing is actually a light transmittance

2506
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,300
OK, this is connected to the environmental protection bureaus in various places

2507
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,200
And now they are also connected to the Environmental Protection Agency

2508
01:38:57,200 --> 01:38:59,200
have this business information

2509
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:00,500
yes

2510
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:04,960
I don't have one for thermal power plants

2511
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,000
thermal power plant for me

2512
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,040
It is an environment that affects the surrounding environment

2513
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,700
an important factor

2514
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,500
OK

2515
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,500
Then it has been mixed with the corona

2516
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,500
so for me

2517
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:18,360
It is a monitoring station belonging to the Environmental Protection Agency

2518
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:19,700
will study

2519
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,660
That is to say, the concentration that will be analyzed

2520
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,360
Then I am researching mainly

2521
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,960
Above this ambient concentration

2522
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,600
We'll also have some community polluters

2523
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,660
incremental increment

2524
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:33,160
even our personal behavior

2525
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,360
will add this part of it again

2526
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,160
This is the focus of my research

2527
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:38,160
Thanks

2528
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,520
ok this one

2529
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,560
Hello Mr. Rong

2530
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:46,860
excuse me, may I ask

2531
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,320
Just two main questions

2532
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,160
inside a graph of your show

2533
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,420
there is a 30

2534
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:55,160
We say that it will be dangerous after 32 o'clock

2535
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:57,860
But your paper got 36.8

2536
01:39:57,860 --> 01:39:59,320
I don't know why he took that paper

2537
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,120
The number of days is less or what is the meaning of this

2538
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:03,620
This is the first question

2539
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:10,500
Second question you have a line plot of the WGBT distribution

2540
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,000
It looks like it works well together

2541
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
that approach a straight line at a time

2542
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,300
It stands to reason that such data should be more suitable for prediction.

2543
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:20,300
Didn't our colleagues from the Meteorological Bureau say

2544
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:22,800
The introduction said that if this is the case, our forecast is very accurate.

2545
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,700
Then can we push back and say

2546
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:30,100
Such a linear function comes out to predict the value of

2547
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,000
is it true what we say

2548
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,400
it is more predictive

2549
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,400
Probably these two questions

2550
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:44,100
Ok so the first one is 36.8 for this WGBT

2551
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:45,000
in fact it is

2552
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,700
Because if we want to issue hazard warnings,

2553
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:51,900
If you post every day for the whole summer

2554
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,200
That's the same thing as not publishing

2555
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,800
There is no way to achieve the effect of early warning

2556
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:00,100
Because in fact, the meteorological unit is forecasting this situation every time.

2557
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,640
I will remind everyone every day

2558
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,760
It's just that there may be a heat hazard, etc.

2559
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,000
That grows police words every day

2560
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,280
it doesn't work

2561
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,320
So to find the nine percent

2562
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,600
36.84% 99% quantile

2563
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:17,360
That is to say, it is the one percent at the front end.

2564
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:17,920
right

2565
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,600
So if we target

2566
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,000
the top one percent

2567
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,600
special reminder

2568
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,720
For example, let everyone

2569
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:24,880
They all reduce going out

2570
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,120
It is even said that there may be some more

2571
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:29,880
including things like yelling with electricity

2572
01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,040
Maybe don't use electricity at that time

2573
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,640
Because it is likely that everyone wants to turn on the air conditioner

2574
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:33,320
or how

2575
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,040
words like this

2576
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,600
may be more effective

2577
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:37,640
so this is

2578
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:39,240
I think it is the consideration of the administrative unit

2579
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:39,800
they won't either

2580
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,000
So this value is not fixed

2581
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,360
if later

2582
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:43,640
About the market effect is higher

2583
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,960
or what he still raises like this

2584
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:45,440
yes

2585
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,680
Actually that's why

2586
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,720
set the warning of this heat hazard

2587
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,920
The limit is only

2588
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:50,720
is so difficult

2589
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:52,480
because it's actually changing all the time

2590
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,080
A study in the United States also pointed out that

2591
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,920
30 years ago and 30 years later

2592
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,040
the current one

2593
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,040
They do heat hazards for this

2594
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
The body does have, it should be said, an adjustment function

2595
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
That is, our body will slowly adjust to

2596
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
We can cope with hotter conditions

2597
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Now I'm more worried

2598
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,000
In the context of the whole of our response to climate change shocks

2599
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Some people can adjust to the past, some people can't

2600
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
So we still need the government to find a way

2601
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Remind everyone with an early warning

2602
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
How come under some relatively hot conditions

2603
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Able to do a good job in self-health management and self-protection

2604
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,000
So this is a purpose of heat warning

2605
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
This is the first point

2606
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
the second you say that

2607
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
we predicted this

2608
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
this this line

2609
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:45,000
It is because meteorological units use complex physical and chemical

2610
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
This model is used to make predictions

2611
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
OK so all we can do now is

2612
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
The complex physicochemical patterns they predicted

2613
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
made predictions

2614
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
We directly selected the temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation

2615
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,160
convert it into WBGT

2616
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:04,160
Then compare it with our actual measured value

2617
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,040
OK, our line came out like this

2618
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:11,740
So you mean to use that line to make predictions directly

2619
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:14,660
Probably not what weather units are used to

2620
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:15,760
their words still apply

2621
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,080
Because they also have to take into account the flow of air masses and so on.

2622
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:20,080
i mean

2623
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:21,860
can i just ask

2624
01:43:21,860 --> 01:43:24,880
Maybe discuss it with the teacher of the Data Institute next time

2625
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Because for us if the linear content

2626
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:29,580
then you might be a math room

2627
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:32,700
then you can assess what the possible weaknesses are

2628
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:36,460
Or we should say that the surrounding area of â€‹â€‹your linear derivative has the highest occurrence rate

2629
01:43:37,460 --> 01:43:38,960
yes but that's not our purpose

2630
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,580
We do that for the purpose of

2631
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:44,200
Check whether our measured values â€‹â€‹are accurate to the predicted values

2632
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,040
That is to say, are they predicting well?

2633
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:48,540
Because the weather bureau is very concerned about what they're predicting

2634
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:50,700
their models predict bad things

2635
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:53,460
So they are afraid to issue this warning

2636
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:54,260
no meaning

2637
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:55,380
So their purpose is to say

2638
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:58,160
Check that their models are currently predictive

2639
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,860
That's what we actually measure

2640
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,460
These two places are also very close

2641
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:04,340
In this way, they are more at ease

2642
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:05,900
Can do early warning of thermal hazards

2643
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:08,340
So our purpose is actually like this

2644
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:10,040
do you mean

2645
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,440
The prediction method of using the math room to push is inaccurate

2646
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,740
No, it means meteorological units

2647
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:16,660
they want to test

2648
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:18,580
Meteorological unit to predict tomorrow's weather

2649
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:20,860
It is actually a very complex pattern in the run

2650
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:25,060
It is not a simple math room to push directly

2651
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:26,260
yes

2652
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,560
It's just that the food is more difficult

2653
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,320
ok we study too

2654
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,320
We can discuss more later

2655
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,020
Okay, thank you

2656
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:35,000
there is one over there

2657
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
yes

2658
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,560
you say zhang hao

2659
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,560
i just mentioned

2660
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,700
cataract problem

2661
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:46,560
cataract problem

2662
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,100
you say you mean

2663
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:52,200
Under climate change maybe because of UV light and so on

2664
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:55,260
Effects on Cataracts

2665
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,320
this aspect

2666
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,460
So far I haven't researched that

2667
01:44:58,460 --> 01:44:59,860
so deep

2668
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,200
The data analysis we are doing now

2669
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:06,240
The comparison is focused on the

2670
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:09,120
Neovascular disease Lung disease

2671
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,440
Kidney disease, etc.

2672
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,760
some effects of this

2673
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,920
Then there are some studies pointing to skin disease

2674
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:19,000
that for this

2675
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,640
This part of white goods is dirty

2676
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,680
We haven't done any research on this yet

2677
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,320
Thanks

2678
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:25,760
In the future we can move towards this

2679
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,320
ok sir wait a minute

2680
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,720
May I ask if the current technology can lower the temperature?

2681
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:33,320
What can make the temperature of the earth

2682
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,680
or technology that cools the room down

2683
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,280
Room temperature

2684
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:42,440
Indoor temperature is cold air

2685
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,080
But I said the temperature of the entire earth

2686
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,800
I am not in favor of using this geoengineering method to cool down

2687
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,960
Because I think there must be another sequelae

2688
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:53,040
This sequela is likely to be borne by people all over the world

2689
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:56,160
So I don't quite agree with scientists going to risk this blood

2690
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,400
Come do the job of cooling the planet

2691
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,400
Or use this volley to clear it

2692
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,560
It should be renewable energy

2693
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:07,400
before reducing carbon emissions

2694
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:11,240
can slowly reduce the pace of climate change

2695
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,500
I think it's more of a way to draw the ground.

2696
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:14,500
Thanks

2697
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,000
you talk about heat hazards

2698
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,800
Mainly it's like turning on the air conditioner

2699
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:26,600
Can I have indoor plants?

2700
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:29,860
helps reduce temperature

2701
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:32,560
Another reason I ask this is

2702
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,460
I didn't see Mr. Lin Zhiming from the original branch in time

2703
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:38,060
he is tidying the garden

2704
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:41,960
Clean up the garden in the middle of the former branch office

2705
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:45,960
He said it was hard to find

2706
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:49,060
So I would say plants have something to do with this

2707
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:49,660
well this is a

2708
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:51,860
It's that plant that does provide shade

2709
01:46:51,860 --> 01:46:54,960
So it's not just

2710
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,460
In fact, the urban green space

2711
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:59,260
will have a cooling effect on local areas

2712
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
In the house, planting plants in the corridor and so on will indeed have a cooling effect

2713
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Some scientific literature has some such reports

2714
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
In fact, the researchers of our doctoral association have also done some urban green space planning on the impact of cooling

2715
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
So we also have measured rulings in this area, etc.

2716
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And it can provide some job opportunities, which is a problem

2717
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Then, at the beginning, you said that 90% of the TV room and theater room are green.

2718
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And internet surveys are cheap but young people

2719
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Is there a way to combine

2720
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
That means doing some research online and asking him to ask his family.

2721
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Then use those cost gaps as lectures or commentary to encourage them

2722
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Thank you. We've actually thought about this before.

2723
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But the more troublesome thing is that you have to train the middleman

2724
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
In fact, all of us interviewers have to come to us for three days of training.

2725
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Actually quite hard

2726
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
So if we use questionnaires to survey young people on the Internet

2727
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
We're still trying to figure out how to train this young man

2728
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
and then ask his grandparents

2729
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
we thought about it

2730
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But in practice, it is quite difficult

2731
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Thanks

2732
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Another question is

2733
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
We talk about the situation at home and abroad, just the opposite

2734
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Itâ€™s just that in foreign countries, their interiors are rather dirty

2735
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:26,000
The opposite is true in Taiwan

2736
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,000
You are talking about the comparison between indoor and outdoor

2737
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Is it possible for the two countries to be at the same time?

2738
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
definitely worth comparing

2739
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
definitely worth comparing

2740
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Of course we are worse than America

2741
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
much worse

2742
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
how bad is it

2743
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
We can use the data on the Internet to see

2744
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Because many places in the United States

2745
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It is possible to meet this annual average

2746
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
15 micrograms per cubic meter

2747
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Some can even be better than 10

2748
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Then Taiwan basically only has Huadong

2749
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Only barely around 15

2750
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
That is to say, although they are dirty indoors

2751
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
But still cleaner than our outdoor

2752
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
this one

2753
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
good

2754
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Our one will be right back

2755
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
good

2756
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
can i hear you answer this question

2757
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Whether we are in Europe or Asia

2758
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Pollution both outdoors and indoors

2759
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
but in asia

2760
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
the outdoor pollution

2761
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Once inside, it settles

2762
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
so every day we have to wipe the table

2763
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
is a sedimented

2764
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
but in europe

2765
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Because outdoor pollution is less

2766
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,000
So indoor cooking is relatively high

2767
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
this is relatively

2768
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
We're down because we're indoors

2769
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
so viewers come

2770
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
the air will be clean

2771
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Thank you Dean Li

2772
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Thank you for the supplementary answer

2773
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Just this gentleman

2774
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:06,080
I just noticed that a data is the data ratio

2775
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,800
much smaller than that of a smoker

2776
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,880
This is not what I expected

2777
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,760
That is to say, it should be one

2778
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:18,480
It should be that the so-called BN2.5 data will sing very high

2779
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,360
The result of that tiny detector

2780
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,080
That's because you really smoke

2781
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:27,600
After a smoker's stats are so high

2782
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:31,320
Or is it a detector issue?

2783
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,880
we passed by

2784
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,160
Are you talking about the information about the night market?

2785
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:36,720
yes

2786
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,800
The night market information is actually three smokers

2787
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,440
And they've been smoking there for a while

2788
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:42,560
So this time answer first

2789
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:43,760
that kissing words

2790
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,480
we just pass by

2791
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:47,800
We're not actually that close to it

2792
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:48,720
didn't mean to

2793
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,720
But speaking of distance

2794
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:54,040
We may be close to that distance

2795
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,600
Probably about the same as the smoker

2796
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,000
So in fact, it is to look at the inside of the temple.

2797
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,600
A little more is actually related to how many boxes

2798
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:08,240
So that's the result of our test

2799
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,320
ok, this one has

2800
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:12,640
let me ask

2801
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:13,760
on your side

2802
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,680
That's this number for PM2.5

2803
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,600
It is obvious that the graph line has dropped in recent years

2804
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,920
But in our impression

2805
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,840
Because our PM2.5

2806
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:31,200
So the Air and Oxygen Bureau exploded in the past few years

2807
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:32,960
just started to have these forecasts

2808
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:36,400
that and we see what a place it is these years

2809
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:38,640
It seems that they are all red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red red

2810
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:39,840
a lot of them

2811
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,080
So in our sense

2812
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,960
It seems that PM2.5 is very serious now

2813
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,640
There is also a second question

2814
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,600
I used to ask that Puri

2815
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,120
when purina side

2816
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:53,760
We used to say that Puri is like good water

2817
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:54,960
is a good view

2818
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,240
best air

2819
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,880
But when Purina turned out to be

2820
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,840
When the whole province of Taiwan

2821
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
2.5% seems to be the highest today

2822
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
why is that

2823
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
ok , to answer your first question

2824
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
The first question is actually usually

2825
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Pollution is more serious in winter

2826
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,000
especially in south central

2827
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Pollution is serious in winter

2828
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
But if we average it out

2829
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
It is actually an annual average

2830
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
In summer, it is actually less polluted

2831
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
OK

2832
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
So if you look at the annual average in winter and summer

2833
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
will be averaged out

2834
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Then you said that it is red every day

2835
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
That's actually mostly in winter.

2836
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
especially in this

2837
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
There is indeed a lot of pollution in Kaohsiung.

2838
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Actually quite serious

2839
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
right

2840
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Then there is another question, that is

2841
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Back then when the environmental groups released this air pollution period

2842
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
It's often an hour's worth of data

2843
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
To compare the environmental protection number is actually an average of 24 hours

2844
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
that is

2845
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
This is the standard of air pollution

2846
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
OK, it's actually not suitable

2847
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Theoretically, it is necessary to accumulate 24 hours

2848
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Ability to go beyond the 24 hour standard

2849
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
There is no one-hour standard for the environmental protection number

2850
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
then we actually think

2851
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,440
Might want to consider having an hour standard

2852
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,000
Because like I just mentioned

2853
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,440
In fact, P2.5 is for acute

2854
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:09,640
It actually has acute health effects

2855
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:11,640
Then why is there no acute

2856
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:16,840
It is the standard of one hour of agricultural degree

2857
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:20,560
because there is no good scientific data to back it up

2858
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:22,920
Tell us what kind of farming it is

2859
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:25,280
There will be such acute health damage

2860
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:27,000
So if there is good scientific evidence

2861
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,760
Then the future can slowly move towards

2862
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:32,160
How to build such an hour of air though

2863
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,520
Restricted standards to move forward

2864
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:37,400
The second question is Puri

2865
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:41,280
Puri's problem is

2866
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,640
Puri actually

2867
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:44,800
let me say it again

2868
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,400
when puri was the one

2869
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,640
We used to say Puri was the cleanest

2870
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:50,320
But in the past few years

2871
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,080
when puri's side of them

2872
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:56,400
The information found is the most serious P2.5 in Taiwan

2873
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,080
why is that so

2874
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,080
It's Puri this we actually

2875
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,080
The whole team around the center

2876
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:07,080
Including myself, I have been the deputy director of customs clearance in the lead

2877
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,520
And then we're actually here

2878
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:12,480
Since last year there has been pollution targeting this area in central Puri

2879
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:15,000
have started doing some research

2880
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,280
This part of Napuri may be derived from the part of Taichung

2881
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,200
from Taichung

2882
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:24,200
There are also some possibly local motorbikes

2883
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,880
Because the accumulation is there and can't get out

2884
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:28,960
Because after all, it is a situation in a relatively mountainous area.

2885
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:29,880
Both are possible

2886
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:33,040
For now, we'll need more scientific evidence

2887
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:35,640
to know why

2888
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:39,000
It will cause such a serious pollution in Puri

2889
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:41,000
Thanks

2890
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
good

2891
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,160
good

2892
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,120
There is a kid here

2893
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:49,520
Hello teacher

2894
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:50,440
i want to ask

2895
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:55,440
Which method does the teacher recommend to prevent weak hazards?

2896
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:57,280
What kind

2897
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:00,040
do you defend yourself

2898
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
just at home

2899
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I usually wash my face at home

2900
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Heat dissipation and drinking the Aiyu just mentioned

2901
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I think it's more cooling

2902
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
and not to the body

2903
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Because Aiyu it's not so cool

2904
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
so you know girls sometimes

2905
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Don't drink anything too cold

2906
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
But Aiyu should be fine

2907
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
So for the body there will be no

2908
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Too bad some of the other side effects

2909
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
second question

2910
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
ask about the room

2911
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Now there are a lot of air purifiers

2912
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Can it filter PH2.5 and PH1.0

2913
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
What about indoor air quality

2914
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Is there an actual effect

2915
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
there are some indeed in this

2916
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I know some researchers

2917
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
some of the air cleaners they sell for homes

2918
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:56,000
But that was done seven or eight years ago

2919
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Basically only one effective

2920
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Now the technology is better

2921
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,840
So there should be more effective

2922
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,740
Then I'm going to talk about the only one they made that worked seven or eight years ago

2923
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:08,740
In fact, it's too expensive, and most people won't use it at all.

2924
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:10,240
so you know it's

2925
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:11,520
i mean

2926
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:14,340
Generally affordable ones are likely to have no effect

2927
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:16,900
i'm embarrassed to say that

2928
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,440
but

2929
01:56:18,440 --> 01:56:20,480
But now technology has improved

2930
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:22,780
From another perspective

2931
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:24,840
This question to students we should say

2932
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:26,620
Actually, I haven't tested it.

2933
01:56:26,620 --> 01:56:28,680
I don't know. I didn't test it myself.

2934
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:33,280
Ok, then I also buy air purifiers at home

2935
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,840
Then I should try it next time with mine

2936
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,120
simple setting

2937
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:39,680
Micro-sense test to see if it works

2938
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:41,220
Thank you teacher for your answer

2939
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:45,320
Thanks

2940
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:49,680
There are many kinds of air proximity devices

2941
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:51,720
It's only used in hospitals now

2942
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,000
this in the hospital

2943
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,560
Air Proximator

2944
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:57,600
about one step

2945
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:59,080
three hundred thousand dollars

2946
01:56:59,080 --> 01:56:59,960
that for pm2

2947
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,740
Today I was helpful, others were not

2948
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:07,740
Thank you, Dean Li, for helping me answer this question.

2949
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,740
This is the authority on chemistry

2950
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:15,740
Okay, we have about four minutes.

2951
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:17,740
let me ask the last question myself

2952
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:21,740
Because you can see the distribution of your WBGT in your

2953
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:27,740
You said that the highest and worst place in New Taipei City is Yonghe

2954
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:31,740
Because it may be very crowded and crowded there.

2955
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:34,740
Then there are many houses and the streets are relatively narrow

2956
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:37,740
The worst place in Taipei City is Zhongzheng District

2957
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:41,740
It's a bit Zhongzheng District, my impression is

2958
01:57:41,740 --> 01:57:44,740
This population is not that much

2959
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:46,740
Then the streets are wider

2960
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:49,740
Yes you know why that place

2961
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:52,740
It's still a lot of water, there's too much Pojoro, or something

2962
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:54,740
Why is it worse over there?

2963
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:57,740
If we do this, of course we counted this at that time

2964
01:57:57,740 --> 01:57:59,740
Just mentioned that heat island

2965
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
heat island effect

2966
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,380
The heat island effect is actually not in Zhongzheng District

2967
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:05,040
not the worst part

2968
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,140
So we are also curious

2969
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:08,840
But you can see that the area

2970
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,720
So it is also related to the temperature distribution at that time

2971
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:12,420
is about

2972
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:13,520
That's actually like Nangang's words

2973
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,320
Relatively speaking, the temperature in Nangang

2974
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,760
In fact, it is not as high as downtown Taipei.

2975
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:20,760
So this is also related to the temperature at that time

2976
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:21,860
right

2977
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:23,960
good

2978
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:25,960
Then our time is almost up

2979
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:27,960
we are very thankful today

2980
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:31,760
Teacher Long Shijun gave us such a wonderful speech

2981
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,760
We give him another round of applause

2982
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:35,960
Thanks

2983
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,960
thank you all
