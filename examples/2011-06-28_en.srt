1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
yeah

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,440
yeah

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:30,520
so

4
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:45,700
withdrawal

5
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,320
In Januarylene felon.

6
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,780
An

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,120
Professor Chen, Dear Returnees, Dear Colleagues

8
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,960
Welcome to today's feast of knowledge

9
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,060
The speaker we invited today is Professor Chen Dongsen from the Department of Sociology, National Taiwan University

10
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:17,920
Professor Chen Dongsen is a Bachelor of Public Health Department of National Taiwan University School of Medicine

11
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,280
Later, I changed my plan and returned to the United States to study a doctorate in sociology.

12
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,320
These two are very different

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,420
Then he returned to National Taiwan University as an associate professor in the Department of Sociology

14
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,780
department head

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,240
When I met him, he was the head of the Department of Sociology

16
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,100
At that time, the Humanities Department of the National Science Council organized a humanities and social sciences camp for high school students.

17
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,780
The camp director is Professor Chen Dongsen

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,580
I also noticed a few people today

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,820
students graduating students

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,040
also here

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,120
Then he was in 2005 to 2007

22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,460
Served as Director of Humanities and Social Sciences Division of National Science Council

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,300
During his tenure, he has done many meaningful and remarkable things.

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,060
He also served as the editor-in-chief of Taiwan Sociology

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Served as a knowledge committee member of the Institute of Chinese and Foreign Studies

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He is also the chairman of the Taiwan Sociological Association

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He has written a lot and has won many honors, including being the research director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One of the topics he's going to talk about today is quite theoretical.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I am very pleased that so many people come with such a topic

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I am very happy for Professor Chen

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is a highly theoretical topic

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Compared to our previous topic

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So today's topic is self-reliance and social cooperation

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
On the surface, these two topics seem to be

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
There is Middle-earth, but in fact it has a very complicated relationship

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Both Chinese and Western thought are discussing this issue

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm personally very interested in this question too

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So we now welcome Professor Chen with warm applause

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Vice President Wang and everyone here

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's very unexpected to come here to speak today.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Because just now Vice President Wang introduced me to serve in the National Science Council

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
In fact, I am in the National Science Council

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In fact, during the service period, it was mainly due to the strong support of Vice President Wang.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So he wants me to come, I dare not not come

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Although I personally feel that this speech is really heavy for me.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So the outline of the speech prepared by the speech was changed again

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
These days are changing

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it's a thankless task, but it doesn't seem like there's much choice

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I'll try to share what I know with you.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, today's topic was just said by Vice President Wang to be very theoretical.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Then I hope that what I can discuss with you is relatively simple.

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I think maybe everyone can do more or less

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
can also understand

54
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,940
That's because the subject of this study

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,960
The sociology I learned by myself

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,080
The relationship can be said to be quite close

57
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Most people may not know

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,720
What is Sociology about?

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,200
I always feel that studying sociology is very good at understanding society

60
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,840
Then you look like I don't understand society

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,040
doesn't look alike

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
So if you study sociology, you don't understand society

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,440
Sometimes relationships don't have to be that way

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
so direct

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Well, many of our students have studied sociology

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,920
then two

67
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
after a year

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,360
They don't know whether they know sociology in the end

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,600
what are you studying

70
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,760
Then I'm talking about this Chile working with this society

71
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,560
actually

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,760
there's another one there

73
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,120
actually want to express

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,920
one thing to show

75
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,520
that is

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,960
We are in sociology or economics and political science

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
The topic being discussed is nothing more than

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,600
relationship between people

79
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,920
I would look at it like this

80
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,760
Emphasis in economics on the competition of such markets

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,240
Emphasize that people start from a more independent perspective

82
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,960
with sociology

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
sociology is not about

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,360
There will be no competition between people

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,560
Maybe the one he pays more attention to

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,320
relationship with people

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,440
under a team of reciprocal and trusting cooperation

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,680
to carry out

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,160
So what we are more familiar with is

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,960
The way this market works

91
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,960
Of course competition has become what we are used to

92
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,920
But we may often forget to say

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,000
There are still many times between people

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,800
It is possible only through cooperation

95
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,160
So I'm going to just put this

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Sociology Emphasis in Research

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
It's talking about reciprocity and cooperation

98
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
that economics

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,260
Let's take it more like we're talking about this competition

100
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,920
Then our small examination institute sales talk about political science

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,320
Political thought is also broad spirit

102
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,460
Then what I want to talk about is the distribution of power

103
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,060
So under a power structure

104
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,420
Probably because of this kind of subordinate relationship

105
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,260
So what is the relationship between these three different people?

106
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,300
I think it is the aspect that these three disciplines may attach importance to

107
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,900
not the same

108
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,760
So I will talk about this Chile working with this society

109
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,200
Of course, I am also trying to solve some very fundamental problems.

110
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,200
Then I don't think it's easy for me to make a fuss

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,800
But in the seventeenth century the philosopher Hobbes

112
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
This Vavius ​​he wrote is this spiritism

113
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,240
In fact, he has clearly mentioned

114
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,640
It's just that people are Chilean selfish

115
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,160
I put selfishness with chile and i don't put him off for now

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,680
He makes a very clear distinction just for himself

117
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,600
for yourself you have to survive

118
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,440
In the discussion of Hobbes

119
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,760
People follow each other in order to maintain their own survival

120
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,080
this endless war

121
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,080
what do you want peace

122
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,960
People can only cede power to this country

123
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,480
Govern by the state to maintain an order

124
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,920
make these chileans

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,000
He was able to be in a relatively peaceful state like this

126
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,720
Come spend a day like ours

127
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,880
full of order full of stability

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,280
this way of life

129
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Hobbes' view

130
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
Of course it represents

131
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,680
is why the country exists

132
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,200
Why do countries exist

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,480
very important reason

134
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,280
But I think it might be a pity

135
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Hobbes if he looked further ahead

136
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
From looking at it is the development of human society

137
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,080
this origin of history

138
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,840
before there was no country

139
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,040
In fact, many of these primitive societies

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,820
Anthropological research clearly shows that

141
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,640
Actually it's not in Infinity War

142
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,160
They can keep the peace in a variety of ways

143
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,600
One of the most important is the exchange of physical

144
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,960
Anthropologists

145
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,200
A famous anthropologist named Marsha Schellings

146
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,000
He mentioned in the study of the original society that

147
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,560
The origin of physical exchange is actually

148
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,360
You are in a situation where everyone is working hard

149
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,320
How do you avoid endless war

150
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,520
The best thing to do is lay down your weapons

151
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,840
Give the other person a gift to show your kindness

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,840
If the other party stands at this reciprocal angle

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,920
He also answered your words of a gift

154
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,640
Ongoing exchange of such gifts

155
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,120
Only peace can continue to operate

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,880
i talk about hobbes

157
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
tell this anthropologist

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,020
Actually what I want to mention is that

159
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,860
even at the beginning

160
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,340
he may survive

161
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,300
For the reproduction of the race

162
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
he may be self-reliant

163
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
may be selfish

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
After all, there is some mechanism

165
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,340
There are ways to make that cooperation

166
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,660
He can develop gradually

167
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,980
That's the foreword

168
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,820
Talk a little bit about the previous one

169
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,820
one origin one history

170
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Then if we go back to comparing

171
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
This discussion in modern times

172
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
that was in 1968

173
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
this is an economist

174
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,820
I don't know much about economics

175
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
But this economist

176
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
1968 The Harding

177
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,820
he in this one

178
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,820
This publication is very important in academia

179
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Science1968

180
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,820
He brought up this tragedy about public wealth

181
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
an argument like this

182
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,820
If people are independent

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
that no one would do for public affairs

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,440
any effort for the public good

185
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Because this public property means

186
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,560
as long as others do

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,640
then you can enjoy

188
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,880
Someone else cleaned up the park

189
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,400
then you can enjoy a clean

190
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,040
beautiful this park

191
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,160
then you can't

192
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,400
if you are intellectual

193
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,560
then why are you paying

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,400
The house has been cleaned

195
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,640
then you don't do anything

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,440
you can do it and enjoy it

197
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,640
For those who are intelligent

198
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,520
must be hitchhikers

199
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,160
So from this Harding

200
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,920
present this tragedy of the commons

201
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,320
after

202
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,760
Later there was a lot of this debate

203
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,600
that is

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,920
if everyone is intelligent

205
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,040
How about this kind of public affairs?

206
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,120
then

207
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,720
probably only two options

208
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
One is to find out the country again

209
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,320
find the country again

210
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,920
That is when we also often refer to

211
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,360
If public facilities related to public interest

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,960
tax increase by the state

213
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
to provide

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Lest everyone is unwilling to pay

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
or unwilling to do something

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,500
Or donate a little more to provide this public facility

217
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,000
by the state

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
may be a good way

219
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,000
The other is to let the market

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Turn this public thing into privatization

221
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
everyone you want to use

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If you can define private property

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,500
After you define this clearly

224
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,500
You treat everyone who wants to use him as property

225
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
to use

226
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
you know you have to pay the price

227
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Of course we also know that there are many things

228
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
He has no way to treat it as a private property

229
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Like the air or the ocean

230
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,000
you can't define

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So Harding mentions the tragedy of the commons

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
in 1968

233
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,500
options he could discuss at that time

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Probably the market and the country

235
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
But after Harding

236
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
There is probably an important

237
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,160
The political economist is this OSShuang

238
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,560
This is the winner of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics

239
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,800
the lady

240
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,500
she is a public economist

241
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,460
a political scientist

242
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,700
Then her most important work in 1995

243
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,260
public resource governance

244
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,000
Or in the book on the governance of public property

245
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,460
She clearly mentioned that

246
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,120
There are not only two options, the country and the market

247
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,620
In fact, there are other possibilities

248
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,580
There is another possibility

249
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,080
So she spent a lot of space in this book

250
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,880
Criticizing and discussing why the market

251
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,420
Why the state is not necessarily more effective than anything

252
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,660
than the average public

253
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,880
Discuss by yourself

254
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,460
Self-discussion means what kind of norms we want to set

255
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,720
Then how do we make this public resource

256
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's called maintaining together

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is actually possible

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Then this post by Oshuang

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
In fact, very attentive

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
He spent about thirty years

261
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There are about 3,000 collected around the world

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
about the use of public resources

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So these 3,000 examples are from about hundreds of years ago

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
in the mountains of switzerland

265
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
forest in japan

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
this ranch in switzerland

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to this modern

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
his own doctoral dissertation

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He is studying this Los Angeles

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This throughout the Los Angeles area

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
use of groundwater

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
he established a center

273
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
those thirty years

274
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Just keep collecting all kinds of cases

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
watching say

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Discussed by members of the community themselves

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
under what circumstances

278
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
will succeed

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What kind of conditions

280
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
he is unlikely to succeed

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The achievements of these thirty years

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,260
It is very clear in this book that

283
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,160
I just said that I avoided being too abstract

284
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,660
so i took it in the book

285
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,840
in its works

286
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,280
The example where it's often mentioned

287
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,120
this one in Türkiye

288
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,080
This fishing village in Alunya is probably at this location

289
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,560
in the mediterranean at this location

290
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,560
Everyone has a little bit of this concept on the map

291
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:31,960
Enough

292
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,880
If you have this iPhone you can take it out and locate it

293
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,160
see where it is

294
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,560
how far is it from us

295
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,320
this alanya this place

296
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,200
Some field research done by Oswang himself

297
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,800
This fishing village has about 100 people

298
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
There are 100 people

299
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,240
It is a local cooperative that produces

300
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,320
But in the 1970s

301
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
because of this market

302
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,620
Also, the fishermen want to increase their income

303
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,260
So a lot to catch this catch

304
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,740
There is no limit to the amount of catch

305
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,180
In order to snatch better fishing spots

306
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,220
so there's a lot of conflict

307
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,860
a lot of conflict

308
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,860
And more importantly because you keep replenishing

309
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:31,660
There is no way for everyone in this fishing group to reply within a period of time

310
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,780
So you heal and you become smaller

311
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,820
Then this amount is less and less

312
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,020
The fishing time is getting longer and longer

313
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,860
So it's hard for everyone to live

314
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,100
So in this 1970s with such a big problem

315
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,420
Then this fishery is of course a public resource

316
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,580
is owned by everyone

317
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,460
then what should we do

318
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,600
If everyone goes to make up for it

319
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,900
Make it up in small fishing

320
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,620
Then do this like this

321
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
you can't get any catch

322
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you can't get any catch

323
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that's in alanya

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
These 100 fishermen want to say the question goes on like this

325
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
is unsolvable

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then everyone may starve to death

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
so what about them

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They because we just mentioned

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They have a co-op here that produces this

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So they decided to say

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This member in this production cooperative

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let's find this local resident

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
let's discuss

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
let's discuss

335
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's see how to solve such a problem

336
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
so they made some effort

337
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
They put this in this fish factory where they fish

338
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Because more than 100 people they probably

339
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
two people have a fish boat

340
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There are about 50 of these fishing boats

341
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What about the more than 100 people?

342
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
he put this fish factory

343
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because it is the fishing factory in the offshore

344
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
They split it into about 50 different locations

345
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
50 different locations

346
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
in this position

347
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
By way of lottery

348
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,560
decide who is in which fishery

349
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,040
to go fishing

350
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,760
But the location of the fishery where the fish are caught every day

351
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,200
is moving every day

352
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,120
September of the current year to January of the following year

353
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,960
the fisherman moved west

354
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,920
Move one fishing ground west

355
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,880
Then from January to May of the following year

356
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,080
He moved from west to east again

357
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
like this

358
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,280
everyone has a chance

359
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,120
in the most fished fishing grounds

360
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
to go fishing

361
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
I describe here

362
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
looks very simple

363
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,440
but what is the important thing

364
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
these fishermen

365
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,600
They are willing to put their local fishing experience

366
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,600
The information fully shares it out

367
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,120
Otherwise you're cutting up the fishery

368
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
to this fishing

369
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
with this reflux of his

370
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
Or the one he passed by

371
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The state of the fish factory

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it must be fully understood

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So they cut the fish factory in fact

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Not so ideal when starting to cut

375
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's been almost two years

376
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There is a way to clearly distinguish

377
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the location of those fish factories

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Then the way the fish factory distributes like this

379
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
So there's this mutual trust

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
willing to provide information

381
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
In fact, this is a very important

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
very important basis

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
very important basis

384
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Of course this Oshon is not so romantic

385
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That is, we all trust each other

386
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
management of public resources

387
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
follow pay

388
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Everyone will abide by the rules like that

389
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
incomplete

390
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He went on to mention

391
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
In the governance of this public resource

392
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Discuss a set of rules from bottom to top

393
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Discuss a set of norms

394
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the rules of the game

395
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
then he must

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
supervised mechanism

397
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,440
But the lower the cost of the monitoring mechanism, the better

398
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
So these 50 fisheries are open seas

399
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
One by one

400
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,000
So if you draw fish or the richest fishery

401
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,240
You will definitely be the earliest time you can start fishing

402
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
you go to the fishing ground

403
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,760
So if someone goes poaching your designated fishery

404
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
if fishing over there

405
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
will be caught

406
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,400
So the monitoring mechanism

407
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,080
it's the way that comes with the fish farm cut

408
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,320
It sounds very simple when I put it this way

409
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,720
But in system design

410
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,160
If your kind of management of public resources

411
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,440
You need to design a system that people can use

412
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
And in the process of using

413
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,360
Supervised mods

414
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,440
The monitoring mechanism is embedded in it

415
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,600
It's actually very, very difficult

416
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,040
after being caught

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
what to do

418
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,600
What to do after being caught

419
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,400
Of course this OSWANG must have a punishment mechanism

420
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,240
But his punishment mechanism is very special

421
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,120
He said that his punishment mechanism should have two characteristics

422
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
one is immediate punishment

423
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,760
Second, the punishment should not be too severe

424
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
just a light punishment

425
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,120
So if you get caught the first time

426
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,040
poaching people in fishing grounds

427
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,480
If you fish in a place other than your designated fishing ground

428
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,440
how to deal with it

429
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,560
Probably by the chairman of this cooperative

430
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,440
he is in this village

431
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
that's the place

432
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,960
They are like our small villages in Taiwan

433
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,080
long radio station

434
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,400
just announce it on the radio

435
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,720
This so-and-so went fishing today

436
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,800
so say it this way

437
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,120
No money or anything

438
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,600
Because OSWANG knows one thing very well

439
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,680
punishment is of course good

440
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,920
because we'll talk about that later

441
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,960
But you have to know that the punishment is too severe

442
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Those who are punished will turn their faces

443
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
he will take revenge

444
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So this will make this penalty

445
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
the possible effect of

446
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
is relatively limited

447
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We can continue with everyone later

448
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
discuss this issue

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
then i just mentioned this

450
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
In fact, it is simply to put this OSWANG

451
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
its 30 years

452
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The result of this research

453
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Summed up about eight

454
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This approach to public governance

455
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
From the bottom up to the community

456
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Eight Basic Principles of Planning in Four Episodes

457
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
doesn't look like much

458
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This knowledge is in fact

459
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
if you think about it

460
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
This content is very very exciting

461
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
wonderful enough to get this

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Nobio speaks

463
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So OSWANG

464
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He said to crack this

465
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This tragedy of public wealth

466
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
between members

467
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He must be able to communicate

468
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because we just mentioned this cut of this fish farm

469
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He needs to communicate with each other

470
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
on this possibility

471
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And he also has some

472
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,760
So build members of this community

473
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,380
mechanism of mutual trust

474
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
So you're going to be reciprocal

475
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,260
we must work together

476
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,320
There is no way to avoid this trust

477
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,040
Of course we also know

478
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,760
operating in a market

479
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,280
In fact, he must also have a trust mechanism

480
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,960
no mechanism for trust

481
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
The market can't work either

482
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,120
no mechanism for trust

483
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,760
It is impossible for the state to function

484
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,800
So this mechanism of trust

485
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,480
is very important

486
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,600
have to communicate

487
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,760
There must be a mechanism for trust

488
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,520
Where does this trust mechanism come from?

489
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,760
because they are a small village

490
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
they used to have this cooperative

491
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,280
so there may be some

492
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,080
can trust each other

493
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,840
or

494
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,920
There may be some kinship among them

495
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
Possibility to build trust

496
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,880
Of course they also have to understand

497
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,240
Because of their shared use of resources

498
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,760
less and less catches

499
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,880
Everyone spends more and more time fishing

500
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,680
lower and lower income

501
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,120
that common fate

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,760
so that everyone should be able to clearly understand

503
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,440
Then Ostron also mentioned that

504
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,900
The country's public resources on this entire Youschool.com

505
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
mechanism of self-governance

506
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,600
The best thing to do is not to give too much of this intervention

507
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,760
Provide this local community opportunity

508
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,960
give this opportunity and time

509
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,640
Let this public of this community develop their own

510
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,080
This specification governing this common resource

511
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,720
In fact, he still has many very exciting discussions.

512
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
very very wonderful discussion

513
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,080
Including that if your country really wants to manage

514
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,800
Then you have to make sure your information is not enough

515
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
you want to make sure you punish

516
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,840
Are you punishing the right person?

517
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,080
this is very important

518
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,960
because you punished the wrong person

519
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,400
will lead to more opportunism

520
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
He can even figure it out

521
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,040
If someone breaks the law today

522
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
you can't help

523
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,400
Immediate and correct penalty over 75%

524
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,280
State intervention will only lead to more arrests

525
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,340
More violations of the law

526
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,680
So he once cited in the book

527
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,560
Canadian government intervenes with the Eskimos of the North

528
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,440
Do Catch Control Canada's Fisheries Agency Gets Involved

529
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,260
The result is a mess

530
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,040
So he is in this book

531
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,040
my personal opinion

532
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,400
I think OSRON is more like a sociologist

533
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,260
But this is of course our own interpretation and interpretation.

534
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,700
The important thing is that

535
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,400
Why is he more like a sociologist?

536
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,960
He emphasized that this bottom-up

537
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,960
This kind of communication and discussion

538
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,640
short-term intelligence

539
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
Transformed into everyone taking into account the interests of the public

540
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Finally of course to everyone

541
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,800
detached from one's own interests

542
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,840
maintenance of long-term interests

543
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,640
is helpful

544
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
is helpful

545
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,440
Then this communication and discussion

546
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,980
can let us understand

547
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,520
our chile

548
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,560
Sometimes it's too short-sighted

549
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,620
only focus on the present

550
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,420
How much can I gain today

551
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,440
try not to

552
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,500
catch as much as possible

553
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,300
but did not expect

554
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,840
possibly to ourselves in the long run

555
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,860
is bad

556
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,640
But after these discussions

557
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,920
it is possible for us to understand

558
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
The public interest is relatively long-term

559
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
the public interest

560
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,060
how to build it

561
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,340
so if we look at

562
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,880
I turned to public property

563
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,700
This kind of discussion of this public resource

564
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,980
we probably

565
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,520
I thought

566
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,280
that is

567
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,360
Are we thinking that people are really that rational?

568
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,380
is when

569
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,420
You see everyone making up

570
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,700
then you can't help

571
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,980
So you follow suit

572
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,520
maybe you don't know

573
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,060
you look like

574
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,840
you got a lot that day

575
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,560
But what?

576
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,840
half a year later

577
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,100
you may have no income

578
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,800
So we say people are so rational

579
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
If people only pay attention to this kind of short-term benefit

580
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,600
In fact, the interests of the whole society as a whole

581
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,960
may be harmful

582
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,440
Ultimately for the long-term benefit of the individual

583
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,320
probably not too good

584
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,120
so i just said

585
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,600
that use of that common resource

586
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,600
like this public fishing ground

587
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
this shit

588
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,240
In the long run, there are problems

589
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,800
Then of course we will want to say

590
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,360
that man is so independent

591
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,800
if people are so self-reliant

592
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,720
Then why after communication and discussion

593
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,520
Everyone is willing to give up this kind of short-term benefit

594
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
that considering the long-term

595
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,560
This effort may lead to better

596
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,080
The effect of individual and public

597
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,200
That's a few questions I'm thinking about

598
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,080
So I also want to discuss here

599
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,680
Does that mean people are that rational?

600
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,800
When we are talking about man being self-reliant

601
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,920
Of course we would like to say that people want

602
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
able to calculate clearly

603
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,200
Estimate how much you will pay

604
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,600
Then how much can you get

605
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,800
Is that man so rational?

606
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
that recently

607
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
last year

608
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
Should be this

609
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,300
Professor of a business school at Duke University in the United States

610
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,800
he wrote a book called

611
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,000
predictable irrationality

612
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,600
that book is quite interesting

613
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,500
So I also read from that book

614
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,700
Take a few examples

615
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,200
let's discuss

616
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
Are people that rational?

617
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,400
that person is not that rational

618
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,300
what kind of problems will arise

619
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,000
we can think again

620
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,900
that first example

621
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,100
i was going to say

622
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,400
this speech is boring

623
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,900
So please come with me on this

624
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,200
do some games

625
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
But because we are now

626
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,700
Our classmate who took my class already knows

627
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,800
So I dropped the idea

628
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,300
That

629
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What is this example?

630
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That means we now have zero 012 to 100

631
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
012 to 100

632
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Then you can try it

633
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If we want to ask you now

634
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Please think of a number

635
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you have to think seriously

636
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
write a number

637
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That means we're doing everyone writing a number

638
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
but

639
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
our target is

640
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
you wrote the right number

641
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
is close to the number written by everyone

642
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
2/3 of the average

643
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
i say it again

644
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Everyone understand what I mean

645
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
We now have this number from 0 to 100

646
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You can write anywhere from 0 to 100

647
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You can write 3 or 5

648
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but you have to notice

649
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We want you to achieve this

650
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
what is the goal you want to achieve

651
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
you have to guess correctly

652
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Each of us fills in this number

653
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
on average

654
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
then multiply by 3 by 2

655
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
the value of

656
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,340
Although this is a small game

657
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,760
But this is often spared

658
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,960
Where is the backup?

659
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
about ten years ago

660
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,500
There used to be a very boring person

661
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,800
On this plane flying from the UK to the US

662
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,300
this light exploded

663
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,040
you are bored on the plane

664
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,840
You just give him a list like this

665
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,340
tell you to write

666
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,300
He'll send this list a thousand times

667
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,800
Then you can write in this grid on the plane

668
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,500
His bonus is if you guessed right

669
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,000
the average

670
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,500
He is giving you one hundred thousand dollars

671
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,500
so this is high

672
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,500
very high reward

673
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,500
That's the first example ever brought up

674
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Then if you look at the online

675
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
the open course

676
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Michael Sandale, who is very popular recently

677
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,000
speaking about justice

678
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,160
In fact, another very popular one is Yale University.

679
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
There is also a game theory

680
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
game theory

681
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
teacher first class

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The homework for the students is this

683
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Take out 10 U.S. dollars in class on the spot

684
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Say send this list

685
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
If you write the closest to the average

686
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
2.3 people who write averages per person

687
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Get a $10 bonus

688
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
There is also a well-known economist

689
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
at Caltech

690
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He is also bold

691
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
his board of trustees at caltech

692
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I also made a game like this

693
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I also did it in class

694
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
our class

695
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll show you the result

696
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Our National Taiwan University student

697
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This student of National Taiwan University

698
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Everyone fills in this number

699
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
We have more than 100 students

700
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
The average is 39

701
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
20/3 of this average

702
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,400
More than 100 students finally got this prize

703
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,600
It's the classmate who wrote 26

704
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,600
I just talked about the economists at Caltech

705
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,680
his board of trustees at caltech

706
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,920
do the same thing

707
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,320
His average is 9

708
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,520
Game Theory at Yale University

709
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,440
The average in that class is 13

710
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,440
I'll start with the conclusion

711
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,040
If a person is really that rational

712
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,960
And he keeps on reasoning

713
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,680
Logically speaking, if everyone is so rational

714
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,320
That number should be 0

715
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,520
should be 0

716
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,160
then why let's see

717
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,960
we have to have a hypothesis

718
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Everyone wants to maximize their own interests

719
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
That is to say, you must get

720
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
hope you get this prize

721
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,760
and you're assuming that other people are like you

722
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
also the same

723
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,260
is perfectly rational

724
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,440
Then you have to do this kind of repetitive

725
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,600
this rational analysis

726
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,100
then you can take a look

727
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,440
0 to 100

728
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,440
You can first think of

729
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,240
if it is random for everyone

730
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,240
its average is 33

731
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,240
So 2/3 is 22

732
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,280
right

733
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,080
this is an idea

734
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,640
That assumes everyone has learned

735
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,240
what is this random assignment

736
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,960
Then you figure it out to be 33

737
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,160
then you want

738
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,200
you know 33 you also assume each

739
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,240
Others are as rational as you

740
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,760
right

741
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,360
So what is the value it calculates

742
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,320
also 33

743
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,040
Well if everyone knows it's 33

744
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,200
you write 22

745
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,600
Your chance to get this prize

746
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,560
0

747
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,040
because everyone writes the same

748
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
so you're pushing down

749
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,720
22

750
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,480
then you know what to say

751
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,400
I'm thinking down

752
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,680
Everyone is equally rational

753
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,560
just write 22

754
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,600
right

755
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,200
2/3 of 22

756
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,440
you've been taking it off

757
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,320
Finally it becomes 0

758
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,440
right

759
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,640
but some people are smart

760
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,480
need to know say

761
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,900
Everyone is willing to spend so much time thinking about this question

762
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,900
So why did Caltech's board become long?

763
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,400
He knows that some people don't think so much

764
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,900
So he guessed that we should adjust it up

765
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,900
The one at Yanlu University is 13

766
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:23,100
Our Taiwan University students are more modest

767
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Yes 39 20

768
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
So his average is 26

769
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
in this game

770
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,200
If you fill in more than 67, it is completely irrational

771
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,200
right?

772
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,700
Because two-thirds of the average

773
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,700
Suppose everyone writes 100

774
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,700
That average is at least 67

775
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,200
Then you see if our classmates have written more than 67

776
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Yes, there are still many

777
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
still twenty

778
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,300
so you can understand

779
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,560
That is to say, you have to conduct a rational analysis

780
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,800
The first one is your ability

781
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,440
second you have enough time

782
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,400
The third one you may have some knowledge

783
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,360
Fourth, you may have to listen to the speech

784
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,680
The fourth is my own

785
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,000
So this is the rational choice

786
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,120
Are we capable enough

787
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,800
This issue is not very new

788
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,800
not a new problem either

789
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,120
Actually around the 1960s

790
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,640
another nobel

791
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,120
Economics or Psychology

792
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,640
economics without psychology

793
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,800
A professor of beauty in Karaji

794
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,160
Called Herbert Simon mentioned that

795
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,600
our bounded rationality

796
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,240
we are not so perfectly rational

797
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,920
This is what we can see

798
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,560
From this example it can be seen that

799
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,600
Human rationality is not as we imagined

800
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,440
so perfect

801
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,760
Then we just mentioned

802
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,880
short term benefit

803
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,600
with long-term benefits

804
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,600
What is the relationship between

805
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,000
is whether we will

806
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,800
for the long-term benefit

807
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,400
at the expense of this short-term benefit

808
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,400
Then when Arie is what I just said

809
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,400
write predictable this irrational this academic

810
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,000
He said most of us

811
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,400
see short-term benefits

812
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,800
we usually enjoy it right away

813
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,400
long time we will wait

814
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,800
This can't wait that long anyway

815
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,800
then he made a

816
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,600
did a this this this research

817
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,400
This research seems to be very simple

818
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,700
very simple

819
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,400
Well, this is actually in the school

820
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,300
We often encounter

821
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,700
Then he will be divided into three groups

822
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,500
ABC three groups

823
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,800
The first group is to submit three reports together at the end of the term

824
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,400
That's only twelve weeks

825
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,500
This is the word of the Quote

826
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,400
The second group is the teacher's rule

827
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
fourth week second week

828
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
In the eighth week and the twelfth week, you must teach the report you want to teach

829
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:11,600
The third group is set by the students themselves to teach the time of three feet

830
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,900
But as long as you teach, you will deduct 1% of the points for every day you teach

831
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,760
So we now have three groups

832
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:28,100
This is the third group, and the students set the time for teaching three feet

833
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,360
Commitment to teach the first point and report the second point when

834
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,600
It can be from the first week to the tenth week

835
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,200
You have complete freedom to set the time you want to teach the presentation

836
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:47,400
Then he took three classes, and the places where he did his research were all in these prestigious schools in the Ivy League

837
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,260
Harvard Yale places

838
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,660
The performance of the whole school, V is the best

839
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,660
What is V?

840
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,760
prescribed by the teacher

841
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,280
When was it handed in?

842
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,820
And then? What comes next?

843
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,360
followed by C

844
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,200
It is when the students themselves promise to hand in

845
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,240
What about the worst?

846
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,780
The worst is A

847
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,080
Submit a three-point report at the end of the term

848
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,880
Submit a three-point report at the end of the term

849
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,460
So why is it such a bad idea to hand in three-point reports together at the end of the term?

850
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,280
because of the report

851
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,080
Anyway, twelve weeks later.

852
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,400
So there is a community in the middle

853
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,920
what are you going to do

854
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,460
I want to help people run for election.

855
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,020
Or go to work, wait

856
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,060
Anyway, let's play first.

857
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,600
he is dying

858
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,900
Let's hold Buddha's feet together, this us

859
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,940
very simple

860
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,460
all know

861
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,240
That

862
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,520
it's interesting

863
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,040
looks like

864
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,360
It seems that even in the US

865
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,880
even in the US

866
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,440
Even though there may be teacher rules in the U.S.

867
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,240
The situation he behaved

868
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,520
will be the best

869
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,320
But you have to pay attention to one thing

870
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,100
he carefully analyzed

871
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,840
to analyze carefully

872
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,160
That is to say, there are students who promise to hand in

873
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,920
Although his achievement is in the middle

874
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,360
but a very interesting thing

875
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,240
If the promise he wrote himself is delivered to someone who can do it

876
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,040
Actually he's doing very well

877
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,640
Why does C get worse?

878
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,120
It's because these braggarts said when they would hand in

879
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,520
but not on time

880
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:29,800
As a result, the results of the C group are pulled down

881
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,200
Otherwise he wouldn't have performed no worse than an A

882
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,160
No less than B No less than B No less than the teacher stipulated

883
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,600
I don't want to give you a false impression about this research.

884
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,920
Because the teacher may represent the country or the government

885
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,400
We just want an authoritarian dictatorship to set what time

886
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,440
It tells you that you must complete the efficiency and the result will be the best.

887
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,000
Academic performance will be the best

888
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,560
So one cylinder is the best

889
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,160
right

890
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,000
that or

891
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
stop here

892
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,400
So this self-sufficiency

893
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,360
if autonomy is possible

894
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,200
In fact, his results are not too bad.

895
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,440
The point is that there will always be a minority

896
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,720
There are a few people he can't help

897
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,840
For what's going to happen twelve weeks from now

898
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,440
His blood score is actually very important to him.

899
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
But at the moment his interests

900
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,080
What are you doing playing?

901
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,520
or just go and listen to a professor speak

902
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,240
If I tell you to go back and prepare for the midterm exam, you don't want it.

903
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,600
like help

904
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,400
Then this will affect your preparation for this class

905
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,000
But once you are autonomous

906
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,440
Although this C is between B and C

907
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,200
In fact, his effect is also good.

908
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,080
So if we want to be able to overcome this short-term benefit

909
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,280
Then do some regulation on your own initiative

910
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,560
So if you release it, in fact it can still be solved

911
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,620
can still solve the problem of delay

912
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,540
for the long-term benefit

913
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,780
It's this effect to complete

914
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,260
So this is the second experiment

915
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,220
The third experiment was

916
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,340
Let's go back to the fundamental question

917
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,660
Are people so rational?

918
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,100
This is the third experiment is will you cheat

919
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Anyway, he thinks about these things every day

920
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,660
these studies

921
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,000
I just told you where he did the research

922
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,920
At Harvard, MIT, Yale, Britston, UZL

923
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,260
these schools

924
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,900
he has 50 questions

925
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,700
10 cents for each correct answer

926
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,300
10 cents per catty

927
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,140
he has four groups

928
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,580
He is the first to issue an answer ticket

929
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,400
Send out the topic, the booklet first, and send out a copy of this booklet first

930
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,440
You write the answer on the question book

931
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,280
About 40 minutes after writing the answer

932
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,560
40 minutes until you finish writing

933
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:25,280
He is sending you an answer card to fill in with 2B pliers

934
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,520
I want you to lift it up

935
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,560
This control group is after you fill out the answer card

936
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,080
by the teacher

937
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,200
in this case

938
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,080
52 questions total average

939
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,960
Average 32.6 correct answers

940
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,200
32.6

941
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,480
So it means that he can get more than 3 dollars

942
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,160
There are not many reporters

943
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,680
not many

944
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,320
What about the second group?

945
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,120
What about the second group and the first group?

946
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,720
After he handed out the answer card himself

947
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,360
After sending out the answer card for you to fill out

948
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,560
give you the correct answer

949
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,960
you go right

950
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,520
you go right

951
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,720
How many questions did you get right?

952
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,000
36.2

953
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,200
Of course he's sure

954
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,520
Group 1234 basically has the same knowledge and abilities

955
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,480
And he did look at this answer card of his

956
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,120
Does his answer card have the trace of the picture modification?

957
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,240
He can know with certainty that

958
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,480
This 4.2 is cheating

959
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,040
The result after changing the graph

960
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,640
the third one

961
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,560
The third one is also the answer

962
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,840
And what makes it even harder for you to track is

963
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,200
He took the topic paper

964
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,360
you can put it in a sleeping paper machine

965
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,680
you destroy it

966
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,680
But your answer card is still reserved for this host of that study.

967
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,000
The fourth group is

968
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
How much does it cost? Anyway, you take it yourself, it doesn't matter

969
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,200
This is completely unrestricted, then you have to find out

970
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,160
From the second group, the third group, and the fourth group, in fact, it correctly answers the difference in this question

971
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,880
There is not much difference in this

972
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,500
So this is very surprising, why?

973
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,000
Very surprised, that is to say, when we are speculating, when we are cheating

974
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,800
We're not going to calculate the cost of getting caught

975
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,800
Why do you say that about the relationship with the benefits you get?

976
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,600
Like this you answer the answer yourself, but the one written above your title

977
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,400
The answers written on the question paper are the same as those on the answer coupon.

978
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,800
Our researchers are right about this, then this

979
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,000
By the time of the fourth group, there is almost no evidence

980
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,200
No one knows you, it's not that no one knows

981
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Can't find it out, there's nothing in the whole

982
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,600
How is the whole class?

983
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,760
But there is no way to identify individuals

984
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,340
Logically speaking, it's impossible to get caught like this.

985
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,800
you can brag

986
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,000
You just straight out of this jar

987
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,280
take four or five bucks

988
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,880
means you got it right

989
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,600
This kind of reward to you later

990
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,600
we will not calculate

991
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,120
look

992
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,760
This one has the highest risk of getting caught

993
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,560
this minimum

994
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,480
But the way we behave

995
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,560
one time

996
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,840
have you been caught

997
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,680
when you want to cheat

998
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,920
when there is an opportunity to cheat

999
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,360
risk of getting caught

1000
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,520
you're not thinking

1001
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,960
not

1002
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,080
than the cost-benefit relationship between the

1003
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,520
you don't think so much

1004
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,000
you don't think so much

1005
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,040
in this experiment

1006
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,000
We can see that

1007
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,080
That is to say, if ethics and norms

1008
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,760
when not so mandatory

1009
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,000
That man has this head muscle

1010
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,840
There is a tendency to speculate

1011
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,640
so we say dishonest

1012
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,240
Of course he destroys

1013
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,200
This transaction in the entire market

1014
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,280
Same time as Osha

1015
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,440
williamson won the nobel prize in economics

1016
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,840
He mentioned that this opportunism

1017
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,680
is to invalidate the market

1018
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,800
quite an important factor

1019
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,880
market failure

1020
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,480
At the level of the human actor there are two

1021
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,200
bounded rationality

1022
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,800
one is opportunism

1023
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,520
will make this market impossible to operate

1024
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,480
that's dishonest

1025
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,040
he can also destroy

1026
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,840
The sense of trust in the entire community members

1027
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,400
No one wants to follow this norm

1028
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,440
what i mean is

1029
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,520
actually dishonest

1030
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,800
lack of trust

1031
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,080
Not only the operation of the market is no way

1032
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,720
what i mentioned

1033
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,960
That is to say, it is developed spontaneously by actors

1034
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,800
the system that governs that public good

1035
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,320
he can't help

1036
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,920
also does not work

1037
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,400
also does not work

1038
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,280
In this example inside

1039
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,880
all i want to say is to say

1040
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,000
In fact, people are not so

1041
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
as rational as we imagined

1042
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,880
So if we're not that rational

1043
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,880
In this uncertain environment

1044
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,120
We just saw that we have no way to calculate

1045
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,200
when

1046
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,480
how to when

1047
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,640
can maximize their own interests

1048
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,920
The second experiment is to say

1049
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,000
We'll see short-term benefits of this

1050
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,440
we are priority

1051
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,440
but we often forget

1052
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,160
There are long-term benefits of this

1053
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,000
The third is this rational ability

1054
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,680
if not so full

1055
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,880
then he might be involved in this

1056
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,600
this stage of this development of morality

1057
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,400
no way to go any further

1058
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,000
that is

1059
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,840
your code of ethics

1060
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,840
the ability to abide by the code of ethics

1061
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,400
not so solid

1062
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,920
not so stable

1063
00:46:59,520 --> 00:46:59,960
That

1064
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,760
he has the potential to cause opportunism

1065
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,120
So what I'm actually trying to say here is to say

1066
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,280
Reason of course it is for intelligence

1067
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,160
is a very important element

1068
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,720
but I think it's necessary

1069
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,960
it is not a sufficient condition

1070
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,080
That reason it is for this morality this development

1071
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,320
In fact it is very important

1072
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,800
And this psychologist in Switzerland

1073
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,320
Peter J.

1074
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,520
And then this one from Harvard University

1075
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,120
The professor of psychology

1076
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,680
Kopach he referred to this moral development

1077
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,680
different stage

1078
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,960
In fact, based on the development of morality

1079
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,400
must also be built on

1080
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,120
this rational faculty

1081
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,480
Then this ability is insufficient

1082
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,520
How to do it

1083
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,080
What to do if the ability is insufficient

1084
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,520
What about lack of rational ability?

1085
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,200
Then we can only see if there is a more rational

1086
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,280
this way

1087
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,200
then we just mentioned

1088
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,760
That is to say, a public discussion in a community

1089
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,000
things i know

1090
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,280
i may have some limitations

1091
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,040
Then I can discuss with other people

1092
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,040
It might be possible to develop a more rational

1093
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,160
This mechanism of supervision and punishment

1094
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,240
like this fishing village in this alenya in Türkiye

1095
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,920
Or that we develop a more pronounced morality

1096
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,040
Or this kind of constraint of the specification

1097
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,440
that would make our kind of bounded rationality

1098
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
The problem with opportunism

1099
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,440
can get some restrictions

1100
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,940
As for this change in behavioral theory

1101
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,700
I will not talk for now

1102
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,700
skip it first

1103
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,040
This is because there is not enough time

1104
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
I just mentioned that

1105
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,760
This study from Ostron

1106
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,260
Whether people are so rational is a question

1107
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,860
The second question is

1108
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,860
Is that man like we said

1109
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,360
so selfish

1110
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,600
So I'm giving two different messages here

1111
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:53,560
One is an anthropologist and this economist

1112
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,560
This study in the Garden Out Society

1113
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,420
The other one is social members of different age groups

1114
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,980
Comparison among different indigenous societies

1115
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,980
I mostly based it on the book

1116
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,980
It was published by Oxford University in 2003

1117
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,980
It is the study of the social basis of human beings

1118
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,980
What about his research?

1119
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,980
you can see this cover

1120
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,980
He is in 15 indigenous communities

1121
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:21,980
probably in the past ten years

1122
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,980
where are they

1123
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,980
they are at this age

1124
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,980
they are at this age

1125
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:28,980
over the past ten years they

1126
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,980
where are they

1127
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,980
economist psychologist

1128
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,980
combined with anthropologists

1129
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,980
to do this research

1130
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,980
The location of this study

1131
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,980
What about the research site?

1132
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,980
from africa

1133
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,980
Then to this Indonesia

1134
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,980
Then

1135
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,980
New Guinea

1136
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,980
then to this

1137
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,980
latin america

1138
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,980
latin america is in bolivia

1139
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,980
then bolivia

1140
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,980
Peru and Ecuador

1141
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,980
these places

1142
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,860
I think this book is quite interesting

1143
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,520
because we can see the differences between different societies

1144
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,140
In fact, they want to do this kind of research in this kind of primitive tribe

1145
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,460
It will probably take two or three years

1146
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:25,100
But they are taking the same data collection method

1147
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,660
Why do they cooperate with economists in the collection of data

1148
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,340
Because they mainly use this game

1149
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:37,940
game of economic resource allocation

1150
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,980
This is of course more difficult

1151
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:46,300
They mainly have three different ways of playing

1152
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,020
This relates to what I'm going to talk about later.

1153
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,540
The first game called Dictator

1154
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,380
The dictator's game is me as the allocator of resources

1155
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,380
If I have a hundred dollars in my hand

1156
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I can assign to this gentleman

1157
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,640
I can totally decide how much money I want to allocate to him

1158
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,200
i am a dictator

1159
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,760
I have a hundred yuan, and I can allocate as much as you want

1160
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,760
if i was completely self-reliant

1161
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,260
i'm a dictator now i have a hundred dollars

1162
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,260
how much do you think i will give him

1163
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,760
How much? Not even a dime

1164
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,760
so i can stand on my own

1165
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,760
Otherwise, it would be wrong for me to give him a dollar.

1166
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,260
I'm a dictator, he can't do anything to me

1167
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,260
Right? What missiles do I have? What planes do I have?

1168
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,260
that can't do anything to me ? he has nothing

1169
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,260
This is the first dictator of this game

1170
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:39,260
What about the second one?

1171
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,260
The second game of his is the game of ultimatum

1172
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,260
the game is the same

1173
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,260
i have a hundred dollars

1174
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,260
Then I decide how much to allocate to him

1175
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,260
but he has a

1176
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,260
Unlike the dictator just now

1177
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,620
So decide to accept or not

1178
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,860
Suppose I have one hundred yuan, I give him twenty, and I keep eighty for myself

1179
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,500
if he decides not to accept

1180
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,100
Please be aware of this

1181
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,900
if he decides not to accept

1182
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,780
we two have nothing

1183
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:17,500
Do you understand?

1184
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,540
That is, I have a hundred dollars and give him twenty dollars

1185
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,620
The ultimatum is here

1186
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,140
That's how I divide resources now

1187
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,220
Then you have to decide whether you accept it or not

1188
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,580
The condition I put forward

1189
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,100
I keep eighty, you take twenty

1190
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,900
if you don't agree

1191
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,300
you won't get a dime

1192
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,700
I can't get a dime

1193
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,180
So this is the game of ultimatum

1194
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,860
let's see

1195
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,900
They are in these fifteen different circles out of society

1196
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:50,740
They all used something like this

1197
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,820
This is the game of ultimatum

1198
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,820
The game of ultimatum

1199
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,500
Then you can see in these sixteen

1200
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,820
fifteen different places

1201
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,560
There is a P word treasure interspersed in the middle

1202
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,600
This is America's P

1203
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,800
0.5 means you spend the money you have

1204
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,000
researchers give you money

1205
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,800
You give half to each other

1206
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,600
divide the circle

1207
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,920
The size of the circle in the middle represents

1208
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,760
The members of the study who participated in the test

1209
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,600
He gives half to the other party

1210
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:32,520
The size of the ratio that allocates half to the other party

1211
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,320
So guys in this chart you can see

1212
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,120
you can see

1213
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,480
This P word treasure in the United States

1214
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:49,680
About half of the study participants

1215
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,360
if he gets 100

1216
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,760
in the ultimatum game

1217
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,320
he will assign to each other

1218
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,880
about 50 yuan

1219
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,220
Usually the chances of being rejected in this case are not high

1220
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:07,160
look at the bottom

1221
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,200
These two places are in Miru

1222
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,720
This one is in Milu, and this one is in Erhuadu

1223
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,120
You can take a look at this in Miru

1224
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,440
What is the most people give it?

1225
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,320
15%

1226
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,440
That is 100 yuan, it gives 15 yuan to the other party

1227
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,400
And surprisingly, 85 yuan

1228
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,560
That is 100 yuan, you give the other party 15 yuan and you keep 85 yuan

1229
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,400
Here its rejection is very very low

1230
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,360
very very low

1231
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,600
Then this is somewhat different from our general understanding.

1232
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,240
Basically speaking, the original society

1233
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,800
They can be said to be a cooperative economy

1234
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,000
Like P word treasure, of course it is a kind of capitalism

1235
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,460
the shape of the economy

1236
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,460
a lot of competition

1237
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,900
then emphasize personal interests

1238
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:06,900
right

1239
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,460
then in this case

1240
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,760
why would he

1241
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,800
Everyone give 50

1242
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,620
Give the other party 50 out of 100 yuan

1243
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,180
Instead, what we see

1244
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,200
the following

1245
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,000
The entire 15 tribes

1246
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,800
Distinguished in various parts of the world

1247
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,620
he is a food

1248
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:29,700
hit this hand cracked thing

1249
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,980
must be shared

1250
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,760
This original society

1251
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,300
Relatively speaking

1252
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:35,840
them

1253
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,380
provide to

1254
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,160
Others

1255
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,220
or this member of his tribe

1256
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,520
What about the resources given to him?

1257
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,280
Relatively speaking

1258
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,340
not what we imagined

1259
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,120
not what we imagined

1260
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,140
so many

1261
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,940
not as much as we thought

1262
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,240
then we are here

1263
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,020
I'm here

1264
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,040
he

1265
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,120
don't explain too much about this

1266
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,400
because this

1267
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
is quite complicated

1268
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
quite complicated

1269
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I just talk

1270
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,000
50% on this P-SYB

1271
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
This involves the receiver

1272
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
one of his thoughts on fairness

1273
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That is to say

1274
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
In a society like America

1275
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
most people would think

1276
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
what is a fair

1277
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
This way of resource allocation

1278
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
It's everyone's half and half

1279
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
that in this ultimatum game

1280
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
who you want to allocate resources to

1281
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
you must think of one thing

1282
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
If I allocate this resource

1283
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't take into account the other person's feelings and thoughts

1284
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
we may not get both

1285
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
so what

1286
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Your best bet is you don't get rejected

1287
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
if you understand each other

1288
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
acceptable

1289
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
think this is a fair distribution

1290
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
If this ratio is 50%

1291
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
your best way

1292
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
You are 50%

1293
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
to each other

1294
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,780
Only in this way can you get this resource

1295
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,600
in other societies

1296
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,560
like this one in indonesia

1297
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,040
Then this is more than what Pizibao offers

1298
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,960
that's it you can see

1299
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,440
It's up to 50%

1300
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,400
But most of them are more than 50%

1301
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,480
most are over 50%

1302
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,000
What kind of society is this?

1303
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,720
It is the first goldfish specifically listed in the Indonesian sea

1304
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,880
Dedicated to the first goldfish

1305
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,680
Then you know how to shoot a big goldfish

1306
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,640
It may have to be forty or fifty people together

1307
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:42,760
Together

1308
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,240
Very detailed and precise division of labor

1309
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,640
so in this place

1310
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,520
What kind of communication among group members do they

1311
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,760
this social bond

1312
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,320
and the one who shared

1313
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,920
specification can say

1314
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,240
is the ultimate state

1315
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,580
So he would rather give the other party a little more

1316
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:06,880
I would rather give each other more

1317
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,840
so this is very special

1318
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,040
the other i'm here

1319
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,480
I won't explain too much

1320
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,480
But the point here is to say

1321
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,440
inside a community

1322
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,840
within a community

1323
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,440
He developed it because of his lifestyle

1324
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,040
that norm and value

1325
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,880
in fact affects

1326
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,640
He is in this game of economic resource allocation

1327
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,160
how does he do the distribution

1328
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,880
You can see this chart more clearly

1329
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,560
It can be seen more clearly that

1330
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,320
We just talked about this in Indonesia

1331
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,280
He's in this game of ultimatum

1332
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,320
he gave the most

1333
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,080
he gave the most

1334
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,840
What about this one?

1335
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,680
this one

1336
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,720
This one is the game of the dictator

1337
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,720
That is to say

1338
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,880
i have a hundred dollars

1339
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,040
how much for you

1340
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,560
There is no way for the other party to refuse

1341
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,440
So in this dictator's game

1342
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,880
He will clearly show up saying

1343
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,480
Are we so Chilean

1344
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,280
You can take a look

1345
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,400
This is an American worker

1346
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,720
Then this black one is

1347
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,720
Is the Iraqi immigrants to the United States

1348
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,720
And then they have a small community of this

1349
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,320
that in this gray

1350
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,880
The gray one is a college student

1351
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,280
this is a college student

1352
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,440
Then you can see that

1353
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,160
in the middle

1354
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,880
this is you have 100

1355
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,640
You give the other party 50 yuan

1356
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,560
You give the other party 50 yuan

1357
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,600
That's what we just talked about in the Dictator game

1358
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,960
you have 100 yuan

1359
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,160
You shouldn't give each other a dime

1360
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,440
you are chile

1361
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,520
right

1362
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,280
So you see this worker in America

1363
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,080
This worker in the United States does not have nearly a million

1364
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,560
70% when he has 100

1365
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,520
He will give the other party 50 yuan

1366
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,080
His percentage is higher in minority communities

1367
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,780
Nearly 80

1368
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,820
Transnational Studies in Dictator's Game

1369
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,200
usually no one

1370
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,240
Few studies were seen across different countries

1371
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,360
I didn't see that someone said that they didn't share with each other at all.

1372
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,480
At least 20% more to 40%

1373
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:35,440
20% to 40% in the middle

1374
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:41,360
So we can compare from different groups

1375
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,700
We can see that

1376
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:47,280
In fact, people are not as selfish as we think

1377
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,760
But of course some people are very selfish

1378
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,880
not a dime

1379
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,160
wait a minute we'll talk about a question

1380
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,320
Of course some people are altruistic if they are not selfish

1381
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,560
some people are selfish

1382
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,160
what happens when they are together

1383
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
we'll see later

1384
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Let's look at the different age groups

1385
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I just talked about different societies

1386
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
This comparison of members of different age groups

1387
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
This is 7 years old and 10 years old

1388
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
11 years old 13 years old 17 years old

1389
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
This one is female

1390
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
this is male

1391
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
you can see

1392
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
This is from 20 coins you have

1393
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
this is hero

1394
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
that's 20 coins

1395
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
How much do you give each other

1396
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
that's a dictator

1397
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
You can see this 7-year-old kid

1398
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
he has 20 coins

1399
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
He will probably give the opponent an average

1400
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
then the trend

1401
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
this girl

1402
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,000
to 17 years old

1403
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Nothing much has changed with this

1404
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Nothing much has changed with this

1405
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
good

1406
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
if you look at boys

1407
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Compare

1408
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Probably in all studies probably have this

1409
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
relatively consistent conclusion

1410
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Boys usually give less to each other

1411
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
will be less

1412
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
This is on research

1413
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
probably very clear

1414
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
a phenomenon

1415
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
so you can watch

1416
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Our little friend who was about seven years old

1417
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
He won't be what we imagined

1418
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
then this intelligence

1419
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
not so intelligent

1420
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Okay, let's see this in Taiwan

1421
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
This is our latest

1422
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
In Penghu and in New Taipei City

1423
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
the research done

1424
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,000
i should be faster

1425
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
so what

1426
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I give everyone

1427
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I'll just talk about this

1428
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I'll just talk about this

1429
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
This is fifth grade

1430
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
this is seventh grade

1431
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
This is the eleventh grade

1432
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Then let me tell you, please pay attention

1433
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I'll talk about this row first

1434
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
it's a dictator's game

1435
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
That is to say, this kid has 30 yuan in his hand

1436
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
This is five years old, seven years old, eleven years old

1437
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
No, fifth grade, seventh grade, eleventh grade

1438
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It distributes the 30 yuan to the other party

1439
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Our sample adds up to

1440
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
There are about 400 students

1441
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Each grade has about 100

1442
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
More than 100 or so

1443
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
You can take a look

1444
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Our kid in fifth grade

1445
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It is assigned to each other with an average of 18.6

1446
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
That is to say it will be nearly more than half

1447
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Then the seventh grade is about 17.0

1448
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Then the eleventh grade

1449
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
The student in the second year of high school is about 16.3

1450
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
So that compared to

1451
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
This student of ours is assigning this resource

1452
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
when giving to each other

1453
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
this time for the other party

1454
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,680
He is quite generous

1455
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,920
Not as Chilean as we thought

1456
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,320
Not as Chilean as we thought

1457
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,720
Then we just mentioned that

1458
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,200
from different tribes

1459
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,960
A Comparison of Different Original Owner Societies

1460
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:22,640
Then to this kid of different ages

1461
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,720
We can see that any one

1462
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,280
we will see something like

1463
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,320
Even with this college student in the United States

1464
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,720
Some people are more Chilean

1465
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,800
what about some people

1466
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,920
he is generous or fair

1467
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,280
treat others

1468
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,600
So we are in a society

1469
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,280
we are in a society

1470
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,320
We are actually Chilean individuals

1471
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,480
the altruistic other

1472
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,160
he is in a community

1473
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,320
he will have some interaction

1474
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,320
have some contacts

1475
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,320
that was in 2003

1476
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,960
Some scholars in this Switzerland

1477
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,320
the research they did

1478
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,160
What is their research doing

1479
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:12,000
What you do is to say that in a game of public wealth

1480
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,600
Let's see how everyone paid at the beginning

1481
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,600
Then let this game of public wealth

1482
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,040
Continue to operate ten times, twenty times

1483
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,560
The game of public goods is

1484
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,880
Each of us has hands on hands Let's say we now have five people

1485
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,560
Each of us has 100 yuan

1486
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,480
Then our 100 yuan

1487
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,760
If I take out this 100 yuan

1488
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,640
It's up to you to decide how much you want to spend out of 100 yuan

1489
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,640
5 or 10

1490
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,320
after taking it out

1491
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,480
It becomes this resource in a public

1492
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,000
Then this researcher will multiply by three times

1493
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,880
if i take 5 dollars out

1494
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,160
triple

1495
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The three lists are 15

1496
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Multiplied by 15 and then scored for the five people participating in the public money game

1497
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
So a person can get three dollars

1498
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Fully self-reliant people in this public money game

1499
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
He doesn't have to take out a dime

1500
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
but he just has to wait

1501
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
After someone else took out the money and tripled it

1502
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Naturally he can distribute the benefits

1503
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Get benefits

1504
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
In this public money game

1505
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
You can see that at the beginning

1506
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
what everyone is willing to pay

1507
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
there are many people willing to give

1508
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
But in this person who is willing to give

1509
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
as he plays more public money games

1510
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Because everyone knows I don't have to pay

1511
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I can also benefit

1512
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
So fewer and fewer people are willing to give

1513
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
As a result those who think altruistically

1514
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
He also refused to take out the money

1515
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
what did it become in the end

1516
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,960
In the end it becomes in this game of public wealth

1517
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,160
After he ran 10 times 24

1518
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,920
no one wants to pay more

1519
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:16,880
take a look at this chart

1520
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,000
This chart is actually very close to the one just now.

1521
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,800
is if we don't have participants

1522
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,920
This possibility without any penalty

1523
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,520
this game of public wealth

1524
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,800
when he got to the 10th time

1525
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,560
willing to give

1526
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,200
This ratio has been decreasing

1527
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,720
keeps falling

1528
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,960
If you keep making him play 20 times

1529
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,160
Hardly anyone wants to throw money away anymore

1530
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,320
Then if you have this mechanism of punishment

1531
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,080
That means we are now for the first time

1532
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,560
first game

1533
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,280
Then I lose 3 yuan

1534
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,280
No one lost a dime

1535
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:55,960
what about me

1536
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:57,720
i can punish him

1537
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,800
i can deduct his money

1538
01:07:59,240 --> 01:07:59,960
what about this time

1539
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,800
this time you can watch

1540
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,800
at the eleventh time

1541
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,200
When you add this penalty mechanism into

1542
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:13,100
The resources that everyone invests in this public good

1543
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,600
In the game of public goods

1544
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,600
The possibility that you are willing to take your money out

1545
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,800
The probability is significantly increased by this ratio

1546
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,000
Then let me talk about the first

1547
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,600
when chileans hang out with altruistic people

1548
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,200
Altruistic people are willing to give

1549
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,200
But altruistic people may be 30% 40%

1550
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,700
But 60% of them are from Chile

1551
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,400
totally unwilling to give

1552
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,900
Altruistic people at this time

1553
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,400
he doesn't want to be a fool

1554
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,900
don't want to be a fool

1555
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,900
So he won't pay anymore

1556
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,600
so you see here

1557
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,400
Some people are willing to invest a lot of money

1558
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,500
This proportion of increasing investment

1559
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,800
The proportion is getting lower and lower

1560
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,900
It would have been nearly 45%

1561
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,100
tenth time here

1562
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,760
about twenty left

1563
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:05,840
It turns out that those who are willing to give selflessly

1564
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,080
altruistic person

1565
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,840
He doesn't want to pay anymore

1566
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,920
Then this research has a very important significance

1567
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,280
what does this mean

1568
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,400
When we see this tragedy of so-called public goods

1569
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:21,000
When we see that people are very indifferent to public affairs

1570
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:26,560
Our first assumption shouldn't be that everyone is selfish

1571
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,000
our first

1572
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,680
we might think about it

1573
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:33,760
At the last moment, everyone is unwilling to pay

1574
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,200
some may be those who are highly altruistic

1575
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,240
He's been a fool for too long

1576
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,440
been taken advantage of

1577
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,080
So he was unwilling to continue to do such a thing in the end.

1578
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:56,440
Then this is the research team in Switzerland

1579
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,200
His analysis is very important

1580
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,600
This is an important conclusion

1581
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,760
is when there is no one to give

1582
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,580
Doesn't mean everyone is Chilean

1583
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,020
There may be two kinds of people

1584
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,280
Simply put, there are two kinds of people

1585
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,760
an altruist

1586
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,600
one is chilean

1587
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,240
These two types of behavior may be manifested in the final

1588
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,360
he's all the same

1589
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,320
he is indifferent

1590
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,680
He is not willing to pay

1591
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,760
But if you watch his process

1592
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,640
if time moves forward

1593
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,920
at the beginning

1594
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,320
these altruists

1595
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,360
probably very very enthusiastic

1596
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,600
so what's the point

1597
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,480
The importance of this is to say

1598
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,760
If you look at the results of the behavior

1599
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,480
no one cares about these things

1600
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,720
Doesn't mean everyone is Chilean

1601
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,040
but when needed

1602
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,400
when there is some crisis

1603
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:51,760
these altruists

1604
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,760
he may come out again

1605
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,440
in this public affairs

1606
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,480
When public goods are created

1607
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,000
play the leader
