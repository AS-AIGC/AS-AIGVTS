13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today I am honored to introduce today's speaker, Professor Xie Shiliang

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Professor Xie is an artist-scientist

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He graduated from the Faculty of Medicine, National Yang Ming University

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Afterwards, he went to Oxfern University of Liukin University in the UK to obtain a Ph.D.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
in immunology

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Then I went to Stanford University in the United States to talk to a master of immunization there.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
do PhD and research

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
After returning to China, I went to Yangming University to talk to the Agricultural Federation

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
i am a professor there

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have been making professors since I was a teaching assistant

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He also served as the director of the immunization center there

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And the director of Linchuan Medical Research Institute

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In 2013, he was the former dean of the hospital

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Dean of Weng Jihui

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,740
Recruited to Genome Research Center

28
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,240
Course Specific Fellows

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,840
Professor Xie has a wide range of interests

30
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,800
It is important that your focus is still on the immune and inflammatory response

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,940
in the early days

32
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,660
He's working on a molecule called DCR3

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,100
I think he just mentioned

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
interested in

35
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,260
did a lot of fun there

36
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,840
and some important discoveries

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,300
He just shared with me

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,700
Some recent results

39
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,260
he's very exciting

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,460
maybe he'll say something

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,160
In addition, after arriving at the Chinese Medicine Hospital about a few years ago,

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,960
He became interested in Tang Science

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,960
So he went into a

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,960
Research on a condensin we call C-Type

45
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,360
One of the lectins is C-Lac5

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,500
It's also his topic today

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,200
From there he found that this was

48
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,700
Dengue virus receptor

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,160
Then he goes through this receptor

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,220
dengue virus

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This nucleic acid virus can cause some very serious reactions in our body

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So he also found out that he did

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If the virus can be combined with the receptor and can be inhibited

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
to suppress these reactions

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This article was published in the magazine "Domination"

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
received international attention

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
also got some patents

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
this is indeed

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It can be said that it has received a famous work

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But this was already

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In this area has already received great attention

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He has received numerous awards for his words in Taiwan

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
including the Ministry of Science and Technology

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Should be a research award for contact research

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then Ministry of Education Academic Award

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ministry of Education's National Award

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Every year, one or two can get

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Contributions in Taiwan in addition to his own research

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He also has the talent of this leadership

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Then he was also responsible for Taiwan's immunology exchanges with the United States

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Head of the American Society for Immunology

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
so i think today we are very happy

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He was able to share with us some of his recent

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Academic research and achievements

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So let's welcome Professor Xie Xuechang

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
First of all, I would like to thank Vice President Liu Bodong for his introduction

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then I would also like to thank the Solemn Academy for inviting me here

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Share the results of our research with you

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thanks

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,900
I would like to thank all ladies and gentlemen and the students who came to perform

81
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,240
Come to Academia Sinica at such a late hour

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
We were very moved after listening to the speech

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,100
I want to introduce this topic to you today

84
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
cytokine storm

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,740
It's actually quite a coincidence

86
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,900
Because before everyone assumes you remember

87
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,640
In 2003, Taiwan had this Sauce

88
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,100
when Sauce comes

89
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,300
Everyone should be impressed

90
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,500
At that time, the hundred-page depression could not go out

91
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,240
I still remember one time I drove to the 101 hair line

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,940
empty with no one

93
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,140
so you know that flush is very big

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,700
Then our AA chief at the time

95
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,400
Also one of our anti-kill Kazuo

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
Chief Arborist

97
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,700
I don't know if you have no impression

98
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,700
At that time, the chief arborist called me

99
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,460
he just said

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,100
Professor Xie, you are a person doing immunology research in Taiwan

101
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Then you come and give us a speech saying

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,040
How Cytoheptin Storm Produces

103
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,200
i was young

104
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,900
I just want to say that there is a network

105
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,440
Although I don't do cytoheptin storm

106
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm going to look up books

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,700
It's okay to study and give a speech, right?

108
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,480
I'll say without hesitation

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,140
no problem

110
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,240
After I finish speaking, I will

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,740
I regret it

112
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
because i go back at night

113
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,200
When I started to search the book, I found that

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,340
This message is really lacking

115
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,040
Where did this Cytoheptin come from?

116
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,340
Although we all know the virus

117
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,480
how to produce heparin

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,640
eliciting this immune response is clearly

119
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,580
But Cytoheptin is still not clear

120
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,440
So a crisis is an opportunity

121
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,840
So from now on I want to say

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,080
then i should explore

123
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,580
Why do viruses cause cytoheptin storms

124
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,980
Why does it cause panic among humans

125
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,980
or cause death

126
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,680
the most important thing is to say

127
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,340
do we have a way

128
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,080
to overcome this virus

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
cytogenetic storm

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So all this research because it's a chance call

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
then a bad decision

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
led to the research I did today

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
before the disease

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
let's talk about

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
our body

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How to maintain a steady state

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And what is our relationship to the inflammatory response?

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A person in a so-called healthy state of our body

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's call it a school of literature

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Those who study biology probably know

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In biology we call it home-news-stasis

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What about when stimulated by various reasons?

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Our bodies are dissatisfied with all kinds of receptors

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can call it a receptor

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It can also be called receptor in English

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Or sensee is fine

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Basically it feels the presence of these stimuli

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,300
when stimulated

149
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,860
you get an inflammatory reaction

150
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,540
In the end, tissue repair will be fine.

151
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,600
I think this is anytime

152
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,240
happens all the time

153
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,540
Just like we now our environment is full of

154
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,940
various bacterial viruses

155
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,740
Especially now that many influenza viruses

156
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,780
in contagion

157
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,080
Many people have no symptoms

158
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,840
because when your body feels its presence

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,740
you have a little inflammation

160
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,740
What about after inflammation?

161
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,280
The final purpose is to return to a constant state

162
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,320
So in a controllable

163
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,620
under inflammatory reaction

164
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,980
we call the so-called

165
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,920
Physiological inflammatory response

166
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,120
What is the purpose of the physiological inflammatory response?

167
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,020
it's trying to go back to what's called a constant state

168
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,920
So in this state

169
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,720
You don't have to go to the hospital to see a doctor

170
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,220
you just hurt

171
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,020
just drink some hot water and take a rest

172
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,320
we're back to what's called a constant state

173
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,360
But what if our body

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,880
If this inflammatory response is so perfect

175
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
Then we don't need a hospital

176
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
You don't need to go to the doctor

177
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,160
The doctor is out of work again

178
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,240
so we need to know

179
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Why Inflammation Can Sometimes Cause Problems

180
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,000
So from doing this tell you guys

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,960
The inflammatory reaction is actually a

182
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,000
complex a vascular an inflammatory response

183
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,120
Because we are in Zhouzhiao

184
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
A characteristic of an inflammatory response is redness, swelling, heat, and pain

185
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,880
why is it red

186
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,760
It is the increase of blood flow in our blood vessels

187
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,480
it will be swollen

188
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,520
It is the increase in the permeability of our blood vessel currency

189
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,600
This is very important

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,480
That is to say, we usually have a lot of

191
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,280
fluid in blood vessels

192
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,760
But when you have a lot of inflammation

193
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
The permeability of your blood vessel coins will increase

194
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
So some liquid will come out

195
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,400
if you run outside

196
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,320
This tissue will swell

197
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,320
Inflammation that is in the area

198
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,200
its swelling is fine

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's just that the mouth may be swollen.

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,160
Then fatter people like me

201
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,600
It may be a little swollen and you can't see it.

202
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,300
but

203
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,800
Huayin reaction blessing is the whole body

204
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
that's serious

205
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,660
Because it means that you have a lot of fluid all over your body

206
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,860
Will flow from the blood vessel into the adjacent soft tissue

207
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,260
what will happen at this time

208
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,160
lower blood pressure

209
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,400
Will go into shock and die

210
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,460
So powerful flower shade reaction

211
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,600
it causes death from shock

212
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,300
The main reason is that the single use of blood vessel currency has increased

213
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,840
Inflammation has two other characteristics:

214
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,200
This is basically the separation from the cells

215
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,100
a prostaglandin

216
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,600
Called Posagranding is related

217
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,500
what are the common factors

218
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,000
Will they have a negative reaction together?

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,300
we generally know to say

220
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,300
exotic organisms

221
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,500
But it's easiest to have a negative reaction together

222
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,000
So viruses, bacteria,

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,500
All kinds of vitamins will

224
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,800
But the yin reaction is not

225
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,900
Only foreign bacteria will react negatively together

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,620
Substances in the body can also cause inflammation

227
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,100
For example, if your body is subjected to physical or

228
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,660
or mechanical impact

229
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,600
tissue is injured

230
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,500
after the injury

231
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,980
Our injured tissues and cells will

232
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,580
generate some danger signals

233
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,320
also stimulates an inflammatory response

234
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,140
what about the other one

235
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,580
your physical stuff

236
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,020
such as uric acid

237
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,220
We all have uric acid in our blood

238
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,780
it is part of our body

239
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,700
In theory, it should not produce an inflammatory reaction.

240
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,080
but

241
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,860
When our uric acid concentration is high to

242
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,580
after a degree

243
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,520
it crystallizes

244
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,760
Crystallization for our body

245
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,000
it violates the original

246
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,260
steady state

247
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,660
because it exceeds the standard it should have

248
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,400
so it starts from a

249
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,740
After turning into a crystal?

250
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,860
our body knows

251
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,980
The body is not normal

252
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,580
so our bodily receptors recognize it

253
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,740
Then there is also an inflammatory reaction

254
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,440
So this is called

255
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,060
sterile inflammatory response

256
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,080
So after the inflammatory reaction?

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,400
if it disappears soon

258
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
then we won't have symptoms

259
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,700
But if it continues to inflame

260
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,100
That of course can cause serious symptoms

261
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
that can cause more serious symptoms

262
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,700
Generally everyone is familiar with

263
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,400
It's all kinds of viruses

264
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,900
Or this East

265
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,200
or say some plum fungus

266
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,900
their various bacteria

267
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,700
When infected, it causes an inflammatory reaction

268
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,900
So in this case

269
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,300
Assuming that the amount of bacteria is small

270
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,500
or when the amount of virus is low

271
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,900
or our body has antibodies

272
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
when able to control it

273
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,500
we'll still go to the left

274
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Response to business

275
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,000
fever headache

276
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,800
we pressed it down later

277
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,300
Just organize the humiliation and you'll be fine.

278
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,200
But the bigger challenge we feel is

279
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,100
so-called pathological inflammatory response

280
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,000
It's when the inflammatory response doesn't stop

281
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,600
In the end the tissue will be injured

282
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,100
tissue injury

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
after the injury

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
it's not going to tinker

285
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's called repairing.

286
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If my liver cells are damaged

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I use liver cells to supplement

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
then no problem

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
my skin cells

290
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
When I get hurt, I replace it with skin cells

291
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
pen cells to mend

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What we least like to see is

293
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
fibrosis

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
fibrosis means

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
when we hurt

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Our body has a cell

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
fibroblast

298
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
called fibroblast

299
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What about when you use it for repairs?

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
it

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
will cause many problems

302
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
First

303
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
from the most superficial

304
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You accidentally got scratched here with a knife

305
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Break down

306
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
why break down

307
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
because you patched it with

308
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Fibroblast

309
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So a bar will be generated

310
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
it's on the skin

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
there is a bar

312
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Never mind

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
girls may hate

314
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
but boys can be sexy

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
a lot of bar

316
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
but this thing

317
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If it happens to your liver

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
that's not sexy at all

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
it's serious

320
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
what is it called

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
it's called cirrhosis

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If the lungs are inflamed

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What about after pneumonia?

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Fibrosis of the lungs

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
then pulmonary fibrosis

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What are the consequences of fibrosis?

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
is the function is gone

328
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
so there is nothing you can do in your liver

329
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
carry out this metabolism

330
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
even as it gets hard

331
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Then the blood doesn't pass easily

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Then the pressure in the hepatic portal vein increases

333
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
easy to bleed

334
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
then in the lungs

335
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
when you have fibrosis

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then the lungs can't breathe

337
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
that's like a lot of vacuuming

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The family likes to go there

339
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like Jiufen

340
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Jiufen used to use that old miner

341
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Did you see them playing chess?

342
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Bring oxygen because he plays chess

343
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
by some wet lika in this ore

344
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
it causes an inflammatory response

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
fibrosis

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So this is the most serious problem

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So I use this example

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
you can tell

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
this inflammatory reaction

350
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
our worst concern is to say

351
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
he can't stop

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Then besides saying

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
In addition to causing immediate shock

354
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
even if you survive

355
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You still have this fibrosis

356
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So in the past SARS infected patients

357
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
even after some of it survives

358
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
it will have side effects

359
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That is, its respiratory function will be reduced

360
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Mostly caused by fibrosis

361
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
in causing all fibrosis

362
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
or be able to transpose the reaction inside

363
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
the main one

364
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The most important factor is

365
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There is a class of protein

366
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
we call cytokines

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Cytokines are

368
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
when the cells of our body

369
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
especially our

370
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
water polo cell

371
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Especially the protagonist we are going to talk about today

372
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
giant cells

373
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
giant cells

374
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
being received

375
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
after infection

376
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
it gets a virus

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
direct stimulus

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
cell it will

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
produce a variety of cytokines

380
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Physiological functions of chemokines are basically good

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,500
The first one, for example, this one is called exorcising prostitutes

382
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Wait a minute, I will zoom in and see if there is Chinese written

383
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,700
It will attract a lot of cotton-padded cells

384
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,100
carry out an inflammatory response

385
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,500
But it also contributes to the so-called self-inflicted

386
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,900
The one that more strongly contributes to the increase of repairing diseases is called

387
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Inflammatory prostaglandin This is called Proinfotour Satellite

388
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Of course it also produces interferon

389
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
That interferon is basically good

390
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Because we all know that after interferon is produced

391
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,900
It inhibits the occurrence of viruses

392
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,900
So this inflammatory reaction we both hate and love

393
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
because you don't have an inflammatory response

394
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
you don't produce an interferon

395
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
But what about when you have inflammation

396
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,900
You will also have these bad for your health

397
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,900
Some cellular techniques that increase vascular permeability

398
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,900
If a cell has a large amount of technology

399
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
It will cause a G

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
cause damage to the organization

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
cause excessive inflammation

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
In addition, I said that the swelling of the blood vessels

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
inflationary increase

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Then I will use an example below

405
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
you can tell

406
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You don't know if this is changed to a film

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
When we usually have an inflammatory response

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
all go for a while

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The patient is most afraid of seeing swelling

410
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
so you see swelling

411
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
so you see swelling

412
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
so you see swelling

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
so you see swelling

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
so you see swelling

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and then reflect for a while

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Patients are most afraid of seeing this

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
a piece of white

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Said there was water in it

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You probably know there's a lot of water in here

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Why

421
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Because when it's time to shine

422
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
high water density

423
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
he can't penetrate

424
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
so if you see

425
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There are many white things in it

426
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We knew there was a lot of liquid in here

427
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
How did that liquid come here?

428
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
now you understand

429
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
is an inflammatory reaction

430
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is typical in a SARS patient

431
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
what happened

432
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
after being infected

433
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Inflammation of the entire lung

434
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
so when his whole lung

435
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
when full of liquid

436
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Of course the patient

437
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
he can't breathe

438
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
we are going to put him

439
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
sent to the interactive ward

440
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
when it was listed

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
After the patient was sent to the interactive ward

442
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
everyone thinks

443
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
interactive ward can

444
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
keep him alive

445
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Then the patient recovered

446
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
then please

447
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
how is the patient

448
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
do our doctors have medicine

449
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
symptomatic treatment

450
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
is also a treatment

451
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But there is no cure

452
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So the patient later

453
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
how good is he

454
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
or you should try to say

455
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So how do we treat this patient?

456
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Basically we have no cure

457
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but what can a doctor do

458
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
we give him a way

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
supportive care

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That is to say

461
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
He couldn't breathe

462
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So after we get to the interactive ward

463
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
we give him a high pressure

464
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
hyperbaric therapy

465
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,640
High ammonia oxygen because he is also under a lot of pressure

466
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,480
He's high on oxygen and forced to pour it in.

467
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,280
Although there is water

468
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,080
I still put oxygen in

469
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,280
Let his lungs still be able to give up

470
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,840
So basically send it to the hospital

471
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,480
Our most important thing is the sustainer of the phenomenon of life.

472
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,880
supportive care

473
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,280
Just let him go through this dangerous period

474
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,920
So a lot of time to the hospital

475
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,960
They say it's dangerous

476
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
to go to the education ward

477
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,560
To bless him through the dangerous period

478
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,320
that's all

479
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,360
well the problem is

480
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,200
After that dangerous period

481
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,400
he's fine, right?

482
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,520
the question is how good

483
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,240
We still have no medicine

484
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,920
just what

485
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,360
is our immune system

486
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,920
Let him heal slowly

487
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,800
i just said

488
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,200
I said it in the first film

489
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,920
The purpose of our entire inflammatory response

490
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,000
not to kill the patient

491
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,240
The purpose of the immune response is to return to a steady state

492
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,680
Just saying that sometimes the virus is too strong

493
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,600
Or our body immunity is too weak

494
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,000
When the inflammatory response cannot be stopped

495
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
He's going to cause a lot of inflammation

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
then cause death

497
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
but once you get over that

498
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,900
when each system slowly

499
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
because we are infected

500
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,600
we develop antibodies

501
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,500
Our T cells activate

502
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,400
So wait until our body

503
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,800
after this difficult time

504
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,700
We have time to let our body's T cells

505
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,000
After slowly activating that antibody

506
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
We can slowly suppress the virus

507
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,600
avoid or die

508
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,200
So a treatment like this

509
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,100
Let's think of a way

510
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,500
If there is an acute infection

511
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,000
Then there are 10,000 people in Taiwan

512
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,100
or 100,000 people infected

513
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,000
when respirators are needed

514
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,900
what to do

515
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,700
We're melting away so big

516
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,400
The melt away is sensitive to the virus

517
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,000
Inside the bed of the interactive virus

518
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,600
no more than 200 beds

519
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,900
The whole of Taiwan adds up to about

520
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,900
I think there are probably thousands of beds at most

521
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,600
One or two thousand beds would be great

522
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,700
then we have so many people

523
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,100
How to deal with infection

524
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,700
So this gave me an idea at the time

525
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,400
That is, do we have a way?

526
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
to be aware of this

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
pronunciation response

528
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,380
then let it tide over

529
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,500
What about after the hard times?

530
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
it doesn't have to be in the aftercare ward

531
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,000
As long as we have a miracle drug

532
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
type in

533
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,000
Then its pronunciation response is

534
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,000
suppressed to the point where we can accept

535
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
won't make our range

536
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Then gradually the patient will

537
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,200
recover that's fine

538
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,200
it was a dream

539
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,800
Okay, so what about the cytokine storm?

540
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,000
basically

541
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,700
it is the cause of death

542
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,000
then we today

543
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,500
Although SARS passed

544
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000
we are still very heavy on it

545
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,500
Because of

546
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,000
There are many new viruses

547
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,500
For example, after the end of SARS

548
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,700
It can still be called MERS now

549
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,200
the other one is me

550
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,000
As you all know, there was a virus called H5N1 in Hong Kong a few years ago

551
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,200
this is the flu

552
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,800
Or last year there was a Taiwanese H7N9

553
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
when they get this infection

554
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,600
same as lungs

555
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,400
symptoms like this

556
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
what about other than that

557
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,500
There is a class of viruses called that cause this

558
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,400
So-called

559
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Virus of conjunctivitis

560
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
we probably don't know

561
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
In Africa there is a man called Ebola

562
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
after he got infected

563
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
will be a great one

564
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
first blood course

565
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The other one is in Taiwan

566
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We will have a slightly degraded virus

567
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Our name is Denge virus

568
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Denge virus?

569
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
in general patients

570
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He developed a fever with some symptoms

571
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
He doesn't necessarily cause serious symptoms.

572
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
but in some people

573
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
or in the elderly

574
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
after he was infected

575
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
he will cause class syndrome

576
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
basically like

577
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's all because he has too much cytokines

578
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Bacteria will

579
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So we're thinking

580
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
In the end cytokine storm

581
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
what is his molecular basis

582
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
How on earth did he overcome this problem

583
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So I take this picture again

584
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
take it out again

585
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
just found out

586
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
why in the past

587
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Many immunosuppressive drugs have

588
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Then why can't this disease be cured?

589
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,920
Okay, so what's the basic reason?

590
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,440
Let me emphasize it again

591
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,840
The cytokines we produce can be divided into three categories

592
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
The first one is called heparin

593
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
What about heparin, it inhibits virus replication

594
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,080
that is good

595
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,320
But we pronounce the reaction

596
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,480
At the same time, the so-called trigger inflammatory hormone is produced

597
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
It will increase the permeability of the vascular bottle

598
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,800
it produces kimo liver

599
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,080
Slightly degassing hormones so that the pronunciation is more responsive

600
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,160
so our problem

601
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,120
When we were in SARS

602
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,240
I have thought of many ways

603
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,520
For example, someone said

604
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,000
Let's get on steroids

605
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,560
Steroids down to suppress its immune system

606
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,280
hyperphonic response

607
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,960
is this good

608
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,360
not good what is the reason

609
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,680
that's because

610
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
When the steroids go down

611
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,760
all suppressed

612
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,800
You suppress the good and the bad, all of it

613
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,520
then we all know

614
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,800
Moderate articulation response is required

615
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,440
So using steroids is different

616
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,560
that some people say

617
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,400
Now there is a class of

618
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,760
There is a very powerful

619
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
The head of the game is called TNF

620
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,760
can we suppress it

621
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,920
Basically it doesn't work too well because the

622
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,720
When the cell gas storm is generated

623
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,320
There are probably dozens of cytokines

624
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,160
You can't just suppress one

625
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,640
So what is the best way

626
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,440
the best way is

627
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,240
you have a way

628
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,880
You only selectively suppress

629
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
You keep this interferon going

630
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,920
But you only put these trigger meta bases

631
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,000
hold it back

632
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,800
then you separate the two

633
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,040
Then it may be possible to achieve

634
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,840
The effect of our treatment

635
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,840
So the biggest challenge is

636
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,560
How to suppress only the trigger metafactor

637
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,480
and compartmentalization factor

638
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,680
then avoid inhibiting interferon

639
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,880
So when the idea came up

640
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,840
people say

641
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,160
you want to dream, right?

642
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,560
The problem is this

643
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,840
We are the most beautiful dreams

644
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,280
Only with dreams can you have some imagination

645
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,560
See if you can help me solve this problem

646
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,840
the problem with this

647
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
question when i put it

648
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
many people are interested

649
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,840
because now the whole world has

650
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,320
There are a lot of new infectious diseases

651
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,440
almost all diseases

652
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,920
It's all related to Cell Storm

653
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,400
SARS, MERS, H5N1, common virus

654
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
I just talked about EBOLA

655
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,720
it's all a problem

656
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,040
So as long as it can solve this problem

657
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,600
It's not just about treating a virus

658
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,320
It can treat many viruses

659
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
resulting disease

660
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,960
good

661
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,280
So when I think about it next time

662
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,960
start experimenting

663
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,120
Just say that SARS is so serious

664
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,760
So we applied for the National Science Program

665
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,720
Then what

666
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,520
finally

667
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,760
The previous opportunity has come

668
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,560
SARS is gone

669
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
So when doing this research

670
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,360
a little frustrated

671
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,000
don't want to be depressed

672
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,080
I'm glad to say that SARS will be brought under control soon

673
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,800
But the people who do the research are

674
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,360
When you think you haven't even started

675
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,440
he is too late

676
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,960
So then we thought

677
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,800
Let's find a comparison

678
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,400
Another virus for research

679
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,880
yellow virus

680
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,000
so prevent virus

681
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,500
There are English called Pravy Viruses

682
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
that it contains a lot of viruses

683
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Including dengue virus is water to prevent viruses

684
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,200
Japanese old source virus is also to prevent virus

685
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,500
And more common in the West

686
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,000
A Cinnirohe virus called Wesnile

687
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,800
There is also a recent very popular

688
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,500
The virus that was very popular last year was called the Zika virus

689
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,500
It's all Pravy Viruses

690
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,600
That's inside the dengue virus inside

691
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,800
There are probably all over the world

692
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
390 charming

693
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,600
That's 390 million people

694
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,100
are threatened by dengue fever approximately every year

695
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,600
Then 96 charming

696
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,800
a more serious symptom

697
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,100
country where it happens

698
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,800
in warmer countries

699
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,300
For example in this

700
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,300
throughout the

701
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Very serious in India

702
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,600
And Southeast Asia

703
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,000
And Central and South America are very serious

704
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
then it is

705
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
it again causes a lot of real

706
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,080
some cause encephalitis

707
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,200
Everyone knows it's Japanese encephalitis.

708
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,480
Z card causes microcephaly encephalitis

709
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,080
But what we are more afraid of is the dengue graduates

710
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,960
Those who graduated from dengue

711
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
Because dengue virus has four types

712
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,800
So now there is no good vaccine

713
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,880
The vaccine made in the Philippines a few days ago

714
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
not very successful

715
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,000
And it makes the patient worse

716
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,960
so we're trying to say yes

717
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,960
then we use dengue virus

718
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,760
study as an example

719
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,720
How does dengue virus cause cellular agent transfer

720
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,840
After dengue virus infection

721
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,000
It's basically inspired by Egyptian brindle

722
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,840
this infected

723
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,000
then it compares

724
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,640
Its special symptom is

725
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,440
when it is infected

726
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,720
it all flares up and breaks out

727
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,120
platelets then drop

728
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,000
The other body will be very painful

729
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,560
That's when it's more powerful when you go out of school

730
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,400
This is the tendency to go out of school

731
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,640
It was found that the platelets decreased

732
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,400
then this place

733
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,080
if you have some injuries

734
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
the whole of this

735
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Running away after studying medicine is very scary

736
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
What's more powerful are those children

737
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,300
Now when he has this inflammatory reaction all over his body

738
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,900
wow he knew very humiliating reaction

739
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,200
The whole body is very red

740
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,300
it's very scary

741
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,800
Then there is no special medicine to treat it.

742
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,000
So when we do this experiment

743
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,800
how to think

744
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,400
how do we go about solving this problem

745
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,800
that's like my first

746
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,200
The introduction to you is

747
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,800
Our body wants to feel the inflammatory response

748
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,600
It must be because he has a lot of this receptor on his back

749
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,700
detected

750
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,800
Then I drew these various shapes

751
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,900
these English names

752
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,300
It means that our organelles

753
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,800
There are various receptors

754
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
on our blood oil

755
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,200
So I had an idea at the time and said

756
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,900
This virus will be very harmful

757
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
cause an inflammatory response

758
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,000
will it be

759
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
It stimulates these receptors on the cells

760
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,300
After stimulating these receptors

761
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,200
almost an inflammatory reaction

762
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
To be able to tell who, say, dengue virus or Ebola virus combined with

763
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Then I have a way to use a method to antibody or something

764
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
suppress their irritation

765
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Then the whole pronunciation response can be reduced

766
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
it's a very simple idea

767
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
The idea is simple but it is difficult to implement

768
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
What are we going to do in order to do this experiment?

769
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
We're going to get it from the blood bank. I was at Yang Ming University at the time.

770
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
That's the blood bank in Tamsui

771
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So my students often have to run into fresh water

772
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
to get a patient's blood

773
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
We just had some educational cooperation

774
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
If you say you want to camp, use it

775
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So with the patient's consent, we took some blood

776
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Blood cells are separated from the blood through a series of complex processes

777
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
After the blood cell, we will store it

778
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
We only need to deposit a specific labeled C14 POS cell

779
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's MarcoForge for giant cells

780
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Then we let it add cell technology

781
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
let it dedifferentiate

782
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What do you do after splitting up?

783
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
we start from

784
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We know that the cell

785
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
There must be many of these receptors

786
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So we use the techniques of molecular medicine

787
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
we'll go get the inside

788
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
RNA message

789
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
just translate it into cDNA

790
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
then one by one

791
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Using a technique called PCR

792
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
to amplify these genes

793
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
same as aquamarine

794
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
get it out one by one

795
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
One is not enough after getting it out

796
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Because of this G you have to turn it into a protein

797
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So we're using the offensive

798
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
let's take it as an example

799
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
this is a sensor

800
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
expressed in this cell

801
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
expressed in this cell

802
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We need to know it is to extract its RNA first

803
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
because we all know

804
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Protein is converted from DNA to RNA

805
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Change PoTin

806
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
so we pump it for RNA

807
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
after flipping it out

808
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
and then make it a cDNA

809
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,740
Then bind to this part of the antibody

810
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,440
make it a fusion protein

811
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,240
it will be easy

812
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,540
This is just to prepare these things yourself

813
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,840
It took almost two years

814
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,340
Then the experiment is easy to do

815
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,340
But it costs a lot of money to do it.

816
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,340
When doing this experiment

817
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,240
i'm lucky

818
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,980
At that time, it was sprayed on this Dean Weng Qihui

819
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,240
Dean Weng said it was a good idea

820
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,580
worthy of encouragement

821
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,240
So you have to have this bullet in war

822
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,580
So he offered me some bullets

823
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,940
we spent two years

824
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,980
Just do this thing and do nothing

825
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,080
finally these weapons

826
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,040
Take these thirty or so proteins

827
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,240
make it one by one

828
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,740
took a very long time

829
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,440
when it's done

830
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,740
This is the most tense moment

831
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,600
Is that idea right or wrong?

832
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I can't make it right, I'm thinking wrong, what should I do?

833
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,300
so it's tense

834
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,100
Of course we took two years to do it

835
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,400
It took a lot of time to support

836
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,500
After we made those Porting

837
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,400
Let's do a very intense experiment

838
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,800
So we just put this

839
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,700
Each black represents a different protein

840
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,800
Of course not only that much

841
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
it's a simple statement

842
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
Just put dozens of proteins

843
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,400
put it all on a plate

844
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,900
Then put the virus on

845
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,400
Then use antibodies to detect

846
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,500
is there any one

847
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,500
made receptors

848
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,900
will combine with it

849
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,200
So this experiment is actually pretty bad.

850
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,500
Then one day when doing this kind of experiment

851
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,700
Bosses are just as nervous as students

852
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,200
So we're in the lab

853
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,500
Then finally after several failures

854
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,200
One day my student came knocking on my door

855
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,800
This Mr. Long is amazing after a long time

856
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,300
Is the student doing well?

857
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,100
don't ask

858
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,000
just look at him

859
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,560
Know the sound and frequency of knocking on the door

860
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,440
The one that knocks very slowly

861
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,160
very listless

862
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,680
Don't ask, it must be bad

863
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,320
knocking fast

864
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,080
must be a good result

865
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,040
found it strange

866
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,480
This student knocked on the door before

867
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,040
that's not the sound knock

868
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,680
Knocking very briskly today

869
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,520
probably good news

870
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,160
I just invite him in

871
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,520
Then he showed me this picture

872
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,040
He said he saw

873
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,520
There are three receptors that bind to him

874
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,720
I am very happy to see this picture

875
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,120
because the left-hand side of it is in two receptors

876
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,720
strong combination

877
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
this has been known in the past

878
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,520
He will combine with dengue virus

879
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,880
But he will only bond with him

880
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,840
He's just responsible for his run into the cell

881
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,680
But he doesn't elicit the cell's response technology

882
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,240
what i see is this

883
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,040
It always looks different from the students

884
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
Students feel bad when they see this

885
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,120
this combination is so low

886
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,880
But after I saw this spirit

887
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,120
I'll look it up when I find it

888
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,200
what on earth do

889
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,000
I just found this spirit very interesting

890
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,280
because of this spirit

891
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,080
that's what i saw

892
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
In the past biochemical experiments have been known to say

893
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
it sends a signal

894
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Cell-Based

895
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Didn't know so much at the time

896
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
but i know there's a good chance this one

897
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So let's go ahead and study and say

898
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Is this receptor the same as we imagined

899
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The virus stimulates receptors in its cell base

900
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I was very nervous and started to do this experiment.

901
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Our experimental results are basically

902
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
this is what we want

903
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
in a nutshell

904
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
what we see here

905
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
These English numbers TNF, RLA

906
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
That's the name of the different cellular bases

907
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We found that once the virus is infected,

908
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
you find the black

909
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
After an infection

910
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Although at different times

911
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
this is the hour

912
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You will find that this kind of odd number keeps going up.

913
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
All kinds of odd numbers go up

914
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That was before we had antibodies

915
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,300
We use a method called SRNA

916
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,100
It is to suppress the performance of this G

917
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,200
You just put this 5A and this TC3

918
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,500
hold it back

919
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,300
i just said

920
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,500
One of these three acceptances will catch the virus

921
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,700
This is the TC3

922
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,300
but it doesn't send a signal

923
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,900
the other one

924
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,300
This is what we want to study the experimental group

925
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,000
you found out

926
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,500
When we take this 5A performance

927
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,600
when suppressed like this

928
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
It would have produced this CyroCAN

929
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
just found it all down

930
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,500
decline

931
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,400
wow very happy

932
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,800
it all falls

933
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
But this is not the point

934
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
if it all falls

935
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,400
no discount again

936
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,000
how is it different from before

937
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,800
We're most excited to see this

938
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,400
the one on the right

939
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,800
This is Inferon

940
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,400
interferon

941
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,100
you found out

942
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,400
after you drop it

943
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Well, interferon does not affect

944
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,000
wow that day i probably

945
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
After spending so much money on this

946
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,700
the happiest day

947
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,600
just do this experiment

948
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,800
Probably just to show

949
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,200
what we did

950
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,100
find this receptor

951
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,000
It only controls its inflammatory response

952
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,160
production of sex hormones

953
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,960
But this receptor it doesn't control interferon

954
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,700
So this is a receptor for the meditative

955
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,040
finally come true

956
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,840
then we were thinking

957
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,000
So is there any way to find this?

958
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,840
to prove that it really matters in the body

959
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,000
Then we need to prove the effect in the body

960
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Of course basically we need an antibody

961
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,080
Because of the antibody everyone knows

962
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,760
Antibodies can be used to treat many diseases

963
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,360
treatment-resistant cancer

964
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,160
There are also many people who are suitable for every subject

965
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,840
They are using Amber

966
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,440
It's because you used to have a lot of pain from the sealed wet joints.

967
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,760
I used to be too pure

968
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,080
Now take an antibody and it will be cured

969
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,400
So antibodies are a very important

970
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,440
That antibody is basically in the body

971
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,600
We all know that there are many antibodies

972
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,400
Our body has many cells

973
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,040
have a lot of antibodies

974
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
so science in the past

975
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,400
they just know

976
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,440
Suppose I produce an antibody today

977
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,640
After the antibody hits the body

978
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,960
I follow my standard U

979
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,640
Like here it is marked with TNF

980
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,080
or cell wipe

981
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,500
When a target antibody is knocked down

982
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,800
it can cure it

983
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
But antibodies, although they are so useful

984
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,900
But it's hard to make

985
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,400
because our internal

986
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
PC packs so much

987
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,900
Each PC bag produces different antibodies

988
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,000
then you have a challenge

989
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,500
If you take this particular PC bag out of your body

990
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,300
and find out that the antibody it made is exactly what we want

991
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,600
and then be able to generate

992
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,000
This is a difficult

993
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,200
so we would like to thank you very much

994
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,300
an important technology

995
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,900
This is called fusion flow cell fusion flow

996
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,900
That was discovered by three scientists

997
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,900
This is Drin

998
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,900
This Color and Mustain

999
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,100
They all got Norbert to talk

1000
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,600
Norbert speaking in 1980

1001
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,500
that they figured out a way

1002
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,600
Because our PC bag

1003
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,300
Basically though it will do antibodies

1004
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,800
but the cells die

1005
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,500
What's the only way to keep it from dying?

1006
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,500
turn it into a cancer cell

1007
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,000
cancer cells won't die

1008
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,700
So inventing a fusion flow technology

1009
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,000
It combines this PC bag with cancer cells

1010
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That's a really interesting idea

1011
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
the cell will not die

1012
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
won't die

1013
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
it's going into some complicated way to pick it out

1014
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Pick out a B cell that has been making antibodies

1015
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
but won't die

1016
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So we can disassemble and select from this different neutralization flow

1017
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
we want antibodies

1018
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
We will use this technology to start making antibodies

1019
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So when my students hear the teacher say

1020
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
When he is asked to go for antibody therapy again

1021
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I use students to color

1022
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Instantly went from happy to depressed

1023
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's been so long

1024
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
more than two years

1025
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
two or three years

1026
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and now make antibodies

1027
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Teacher, tell me how long I will do it

1028
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So the student immediately the excitement

1029
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
gone soon

1030
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Just go back and start working hard to make antibodies

1031
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Then we disassemble and select the antibody we want

1032
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Three years after the antibody came, it was another big day

1033
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
is it useful

1034
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So our student is basically

1035
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
He took the five-digit antibody we wanted

1036
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Hit the rat alive and immunize him

1037
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,600
After immunization, he developed antibodies

1038
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,400
After producing antibodies, he produced a lot of B cells

1039
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,200
After the B cell, he fuses it with the swollen cell

1040
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,800
Then use a drug screen to screen

1041
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
It's easy to say anyway

1042
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,800
It takes about a year to talk in one minute, and that's it.

1043
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,400
So we worked for a long time and finally got several antibodies

1044
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,200
What about when the antibody comes?

1045
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,200
We hit the rats

1046
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Then we use a mouse model

1047
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,600
When the mouse basically hits in, you will find

1048
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,800
he will bleed

1049
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,000
so put the mouse behind you see

1050
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
That's a lot of bleeding

1051
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,800
The intestines are also bleeding

1052
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Then we put our production of this antibody

1053
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,000
This is the control antibody

1054
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,600
Because doing time requires a control group

1055
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
This is an antibody with no specificity

1056
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,100
it is not protective

1057
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,600
This is one of our antibodies

1058
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
You'll find typing this

1059
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,800
His subcutaneous bleeding has been suppressed.

1060
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,900
Intestinal bleeding was also suppressed

1061
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,300
What about re-entry proof?

1062
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,100
we'll just do a dye

1063
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,800
That's called Even Blue

1064
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Because of this blue dye

1065
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Because of this blue dye

1066
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It usually does not increase in vascular access

1067
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
it's inside a blood vessel

1068
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
But once the pronunciation reacts

1069
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Its vascular access is increased

1070
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
After the increase, it will run outside and go out

1071
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So you start from the shade of its color

1072
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
you can tell

1073
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
changes in its vascular access

1074
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Is it suppressed

1075
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
This is an easy experiment to do

1076
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
recently discovered

1077
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
This is the antibody of the control group

1078
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
or do not fight are blue blue

1079
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
After the antibody, you will find that it is not blue anymore

1080
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Then in this liver

1081
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Basically processing is inhibited in the gastrointestinal tract

1082
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
OK, what about after the fight?

1083
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Review was not satisfied when this submission was made

1084
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
He said, are your antibodies so good?

1085
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Just like the Amber we just talked about

1086
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
bad food diet

1087
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
that drug to compare

1088
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
This antibody sells about 10 B chains a year

1089
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
There are 10 B chains in the world

1090
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
U.S. dollars are 10 billion U.S. dollars

1091
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
This is a very big medicine

1092
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,640
Let's compare and see if its blue rendering is suppressed

1093
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,960
Then you are on the right hand side with this green is under control

1094
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,760
You just find out and say wow it's infected and it's very blue

1095
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,760
Then we hit the antibody, the ambo, the ambo

1096
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,840
There is some effect, but it is not very obvious, just purple

1097
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
But after taking our antibody, you will find

1098
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,440
It's red to see it's all suppressed

1099
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,000
So from this quantitative experiment you can clearly

1100
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,080
It can be known that if the antibody is knocked down, it can indeed kill it.

1101
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Vascular permeability Inhibited

1102
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Then let's look at its survival rate

1103
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,080
This is an early experiment, after doing this experiment

1104
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,080
You find that no treatment or control treatment

1105
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,080
The rats all died within two weeks

1106
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
But we hit one of the antibodies

1107
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,080
Works well, about 50% of the mice don't die.

1108
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,080
So doing this experiment is finally a success

1109
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
My student finally said, teacher, are you satisfied now?

1110
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
I can graduate, okay?

1111
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Not yet, why, because I haven't cheated yet

1112
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So we later wanted to say that this study was good.

1113
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Let's go and submit to a journal called Nature

1114
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
This nature journal is considered to be currently in the Holy Literature

1115
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It's a top-notch magazine, so let's try it out.

1116
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
After they voted in, they thought our stuff was very interesting.

1117
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
so quickly accepted

1118
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
after accepting

1119
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Let's make a picture like this

1120
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Let's summarise what we found

1121
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
That was basically in 2008

1122
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
We will submit to this research journal

1123
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You just draw a picture to explain the concept

1124
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Which means we found something in mice

1125
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
normal infection time

1126
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
you will generate a lot of this

1127
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
The so-called Trigger Addiction Base is on the left hand side.

1128
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Then you increase the permeability of Chen Qiu’s tube

1129
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
After the permeability is increased, the mice will eventually die.

1130
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
After we fight this resistance, it basically suppresses the virus

1131
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
it stimulates this receptor

1132
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So it's still a bit of a fix it's already reacting

1133
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But this amount is not high

1134
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But the hepatic derivative is not affected

1135
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
so it's blood vessel angiovirus

1136
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
So in this way, we proved that the last immunity of this mouse

1137
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Although this mouse received treatment

1138
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
He will eventually develop antibodies

1139
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
His Tc activation does not affect the subsequent immune response at all

1140
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So the mouse will survive

1141
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
so this is our job

1142
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Then another interesting thing happened when this was submitted

1143
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
when we were submitting

1144
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Basically, this magazine has a bit of news

1145
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So he always said that it is not allowed to publish without our permission

1146
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Because you retracted your paper after you published it

1147
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Wow everyone is serious

1148
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
After working for so long, the manuscript was withdrawn next to each other

1149
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
the result is very tense

1150
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
But one day I got a call

1151
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
just say i'm a so and so newspaper

1152
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The British newspaper said that I want to interview you

1153
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I was shocked when I heard that, and I said how do you know

1154
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I said I can't tell you

1155
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
What should I do if my manuscript is withdrawn after I told you?

1156
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
He said it doesn't matter, we are going to advertise for you

1157
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
so i just

1158
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'll tell him a little later

1159
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I didn't expect that he really advertised for me.

1160
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
he advertises

1161
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
this ad

1162
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,600
not too small

1163
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
call me that

1164
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
it's a british newspaper

1165
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
called Telegram

1166
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,000
He helped us board a

1167
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,800
a discovery

1168
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,600
say this

1169
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,000
A Breakthrough

1170
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,600
doing dengue treatment

1171
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Is Breakthrough

1172
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,200
so here's his report

1173
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Ah, is this English?

1174
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,800
of course i understand

1175
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
Can you understand this?

1176
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
this he can see berlin

1177
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,600
take a look here

1178
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,200
more like german newspapers

1179
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,800
Then how do I know he reported me?

1180
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,400
Because only dengue

1181
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,000
He sees series 5A

1182
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,400
i was thinking

1183
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,600
This should be reporting something to me

1184
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,800
So which of my classmates see

1185
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:40,400
he said nothing wrong

1186
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,600
this is reporting your news

1187
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,200
this is a german newspaper

1188
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,800
this is AFP

1189
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,600
of course

1190
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,800
we understand

1191
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,600
Do you guys understand?

1192
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,200
what text is this

1193
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,000
It is said that this is a bilingual

1194
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:58,800
I also can not understand

1195
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
But all I see is this

1196
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,560
I'll come back to know that I'm reporting our news

1197
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,960
probably not wrong

1198
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
So Russian newspapers report

1199
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,720
People's Daily

1200
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,400
Eating our tofu is said to be a Taiwanese scientist

1201
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,720
OK People's Daily also reported

1202
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,320
Then what is this text

1203
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,520
This seems to be from Central and South America

1204
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,600
basically like spanish

1205
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,920
basically the same report

1206
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,400
and this

1207
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,200
This doesn't seem to be the case

1208
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
It is said that it seems to be Thai

1209
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,600
I don't understand the same

1210
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,480
But I just look at the keywords

1211
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,720
this dengue fever

1212
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,680
Sidereal look

1213
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,040
Nature No A

1214
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
I'm probably saying I'm probably not wrong

1215
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,840
Finally, it seems to be in Vietnamese

1216
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,240
also do the same thing

1217
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,200
so what

1218
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,120
basically this is a story

1219
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,400
that is one of us

1220
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,240
from a very simple idea

1221
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,080
just one stimulated by reflection

1222
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,120
then we start

1223
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Let's think about it, after thinking about it

1224
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Let's think about someone from the past

1225
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
a question never thought of

1226
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
then we get rid of it

1227
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
later

1228
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So this is one that makes us feel

1229
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Doing scientific research this is probably

1230
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
feel most encouraged

1231
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It means you have an idea in Chinese

1232
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
You are not bored come true you bored wish come true

1233
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
prove what you think

1234
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Well, after we have that experiment

1235
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Next I'm going to add a little more

1236
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
People will say you're just treating dengue fever

1237
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
there are so many viruses

1238
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
what's the use

1239
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Are you real?

1240
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
So then we're at Yellow Paper Virus

1241
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
We also made two viruses

1242
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
A virus that makes Japanese old people

1243
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Basically also get similar results

1244
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Then we also make a New Nile virus

1245
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
did a basically similar result

1246
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
after that

1247
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Another problem is

1248
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
need some imagination

1249
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Is it really only effective against dengue virus

1250
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Does it have a similar effect on other viruses?

1251
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
then i have a good partner

1252
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It's Dr. Yan Huilin at the University of Hong Kong

1253
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Because of Hong Kong's love flu, they are doing this special movie Fu En Za

1254
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yingfu Enza This influenza virus is harmful to humans

1255
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Indecent to dengue virus

1256
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You see he is very complex, he has many types

1257
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
He has H and N H has type 18 N has type 11

1258
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
He is also a virus and then mutation

1259
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
After his mutation changes, many of his drugs are of course ineffective

1260
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So we were thinking

1261
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
We can use a similar concept for such virus blessing

1262
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Wouldn't it work for us to suppress his vocal response?

1263
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,000
So we picked that H5N1 to do

1264
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
His danger to humans you can see from this table

1265
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
During the two years from 1989 to 1990

1266
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
When H2N2 infected this Russian food

1267
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
1 million deaths

1268
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
The most famous one from 1988 to 1999 is the H1N1

1269
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,400
The most serious death in history is about 50 to 100 million

1270
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,000
this is a very scary number

1271
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,700
Also in the early 20th century

1272
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,700
about 100 years ago

1273
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,900
Are we 2018 this year

1274
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:10,900
that 100 years ago

1275
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,900
it's scary

1276
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,700
This million seven trillion yeah

1277
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,100
50 to 100 million deaths

1278
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,900
that's an incredible number

1279
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,900
In another H1 virus

1280
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,400
There are also about two million in H2N2

1281
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,400
Then Hong Kong is about a million

1282
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,800
So now I'm probably scared

1283
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:26,700
in case there is one

1284
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,300
What should I do if another very powerful virus comes out suddenly?

1285
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,700
That's why we did this experiment

1286
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,100
We'll get a genetically engineered virus

1287
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,100
This is from the University of Hong Kong

1288
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,800
It can be operated in P2S1 time

1289
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,300
This is called H5N1

1290
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,500
That's the first thing we say

1291
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,900
Will it follow a lot

1292
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,100
This Lectin combines

1293
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,800
Then we found out that it really

1294
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
Can be combined with many Lectins

1295
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
one of them

1296
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,700
Obviously it is this C-Lectin that sends A

1297
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
it will unite with it

1298
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,400
So we'll use this grid

1299
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,000
Use this H5N1 to see

1300
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,700
Does blocking it work?

1301
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,440
So basically why do this thing is the same

1302
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,440
Because although bird flu

1303
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
Its infection is higher on this cell than

1304
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,940
But its main bad flu

1305
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,940
It still comes from this MACOVAGE

1306
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,440
So the same thing we think is to say

1307
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,440
Although it cannot inhibit the infection of the virus

1308
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,940
i was just about to say

1309
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,940
When I was doing dengue virus treatment in front of me

1310
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,940
It has a characteristic that I forgot to mention specifically, that is

1311
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,440
when we fight

1312
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,940
In fact, the virus has not decreased

1313
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,940
the virus is still inside

1314
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,940
But the virus is inside

1315
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,940
But it won't eat our RECEPT

1316
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,940
So it was cleared in the end

1317
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,940
So we want to say yes

1318
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,940
Although this is not the same as dengue virus

1319
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,940
Dengue virus can be found in

1320
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,940
Dead cells grow a lot inside each other

1321
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,940
But H1Y is mainly in this aspect compared with cell

1322
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,940
But it's going to make a bad flu or here

1323
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,940
Then let's take a look at our test class

1324
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,940
Is it still valid

1325
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,940
The results proved to be effective

1326
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,940
So that is to say

1327
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,940
in all the past worlds

1328
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
in the experiment

1329
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,700
Whether in dengue virus or

1330
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,800
Or it's the same if you're emotionally ill

1331
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,800
we are without treatment

1332
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,500
Our cells are hyperactive

1333
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,000
It generates a lot of this trigger source technology

1334
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,800
Then it will die is what I just said at the beginning

1335
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,000
It will increase the pain of this blood vessel

1336
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,500
will focus on shock

1337
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,500
Will be quadriplegic

1338
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,000
then die

1339
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,500
So if we have a good antibody

1340
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,900
What about after this antibody blocks it?

1341
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,900
Basically it is possible to make it this amount

1342
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,100
After this antibody is knocked down

1343
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,700
Antibody against five

1344
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,500
It makes this inflammatory technique so less

1345
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,700
But its infectious agent still exists

1346
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,900
what is the benefit

1347
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,100
We are all

1348
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,600
What about viral replication?

1349
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,300
Many of our drugs are under control

1350
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:48,300
replication of the virus

1351
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
But sometimes when it develops resistance

1352
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,400
you can't heal it copy

1353
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,000
Our treatment is

1354
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,600
Whether the management virus has mutated

1355
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,100
as long as you virus last

1356
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,100
It has to have limbs this

1357
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,760
If 5A is used to produce inflammatory hormones

1358
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,760
I just block this part

1359
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,800
no matter what virus you are

1360
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,200
Assuming your virus doesn't stimulate 5A

1361
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,060
It certainly doesn't cause an inflammatory reaction

1362
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,560
But the virus assumes it still wants

1363
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,800
If an inflammatory response occurs through this 5A

1364
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,760
I just need to block him

1365
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,320
I can bring the inflammation down

1366
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,200
Finally let the body

1367
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,600
his symptoms relieved

1368
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,820
and then allow the patient to tide over

1369
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,760
so this is our whole

1370
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,080
A treatment for cytokine storm

1371
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,480
a new concept

1372
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,280
ok so in the end

1373
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,020
that is to say it is

1374
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,320
Most of this work is done at Yangming

1375
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,280
My favorite mountain climbing in Yangming

1376
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,280
The Guanyin Mountain I see every day

1377
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,680
so this

1378
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,980
I watch this every day

1379
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,820
when doing experiments

1380
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,580
when can't do it

1381
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,580
I like to climb mountains to see the scenery

1382
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,660
calm yourself down

1383
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,980
Especially when the experiment doesn't go well

1384
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,700
Look at the mountain climbing is pretty good

1385
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,100
So I suggest you come and go

1386
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
go to church runner

1387
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Finally, I would like to thank many people

1388
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Including my student Xu Cuiling in the center

1389
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
And this teacher Lin Yiling who looks like a lot

1390
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Especially Teacher Lin Yiling

1391
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
He's the one who first called me dengue virus

1392
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
He is the first humble person in Taiwan to do dengue virus

1393
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
He taught a lot about dengue virus

1394
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So this is a very good cooperation between our two sides

1395
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Then also thank our vice president, Vice President Lu, Vice President

1396
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And this Dean Wang at the beginning

1397
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
This Baihui superstar gave us a support

1398
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Then my many experiments basically

1399
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It was also completed in Yangming and various

1400
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
that last love flu virus

1401
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
This was given by Dr. Yan Huining, University of Hong Kong

1402
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And his boss is Paris

1403
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Paris is a very famous professor

1404
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
He just came to Taiwan

1405
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
He is the first to identify

1406
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The scientist who monitored the SARS virus

1407
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So we now have a

1408
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,400
good cooperation

1409
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,020
Then use this to represent

1410
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:05,900
In fact, doing a research requires countless

1411
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,020
In addition to countless financial and material support

1412
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,420
We still need a lot of scientists

1413
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,060
students work together

1414
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,100
Then there are actually a lot of discussions in the middle

1415
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,020
because of the experiment

1416
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,220
Let's talk about it now

1417
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,500
It's easy for us to look back now

1418
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,220
Just do 1 2 3 4

1419
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:22,620
In fact, when you look forward

1420
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,700
is a lot of friction

1421
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,500
Then spray a lot of measures

1422
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,220
So this needs a lot of good friends

1423
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,100
good partner

1424
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,500
Only by working hard can one overcome

1425
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,500
To achieve what we are today

1426
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,700
then i think it's this

1427
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,500
It is our best video

1428
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,700
thank you

1429
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,500
Li Ming

1430
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,100
Well, we thank Professor Xie Shiliang

1431
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,300
very good speech

1432
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,900
And share him with us

1433
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:46,900
this

1434
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
this success story

1435
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,900
Then we do know that in our

1436
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,400
we have this

1437
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,100
Those who do scientific research are

1438
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,700
we have a very

1439
00:53:58,700 --> 00:53:59,700
is Passion

1440
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But it is often a difficult process

1441
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Then there will be some results

1442
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
These results, especially in the case of Professor Xie

1443
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
In fact, the impact on society is huge

1444
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
This is the way to treat some diseases in the future

1445
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
For example, Denge is hot, other emotions are like this

1446
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
We just have time now for people to ask questions

1447
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
To encourage everyone, so we have the magazine Scienceman

1448
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
If you have any questions, we will

1449
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Think of this magazine as

1450
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
as the nature of this encouragement

1451
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Now here's one who starts

1452
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's it

1453
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Hello teacher, this is the second time I listen to the teacher's speech

1454
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I am the dermatologist at Chang Gung Hospital

1455
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
The topic of the teacher's speech last time was EBV

1456
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Then this time the words are

1457
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,760
I am also still very interested in viral infection

1458
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,640
Then I have a few questions to ask the teacher

1459
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,040
is the first to say

1460
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,040
Because the Passo group is in

1461
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,600
That is to say, on our ice bed

1462
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,920
That is, many Passo groups will cause

1463
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,640
Satocon stone looks like this

1464
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,360
That's actually being a patient

1465
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,600
When a Satocon stone occurs

1466
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,240
He's actually pretty consistent

1467
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,320
that's hard to find that says

1468
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,120
Accurate Passo group to treat

1469
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,040
Just come is the Antifiral group

1470
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:24,920
That is to say, the patient

1471
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,480
Usually this happens

1472
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,720
It's just that we are just shooting birds

1473
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,000
all antibiotics

1474
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,840
All antiviral drugs are like this

1475
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,280
The first question I want to ask the teacher is

1476
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,400
Do we currently have some cruell

1477
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,560
It is the Satocon stone that can be used

1478
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,000
The type of his Satocon

1479
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,960
or his proportions and performance

1480
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,760
pushing his Passo group back and forth

1481
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,200
what kind of infection

1482
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,200
This is the first one

1483
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,440
The second is that I want to ask the teacher to say

1484
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,080
Hit CLEC5A Antibody

1485
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,320
Come to suppress the function of Information

1486
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,200
when is better

1487
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,160
is post infection

1488
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,460
Then it is also effective to fight before infection

1489
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,000
It's been a long time

1490
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,660
Like because honestly there are a lot of viral infections

1491
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,920
Then we can't have only one infection in our lifetime

1492
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,920
So if we later treated it as a preventative medicine

1493
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,880
like the gram flu

1494
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,840
Will you call more times

1495
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,360
Then it didn't work like this

1496
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,200
The third question I want to know says

1497
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,440
Because I'm doing enterovirus now

1498
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,760
Then I want to know that it is the part of the enterovirus

1499
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,800
It is enterovirus, which is actually a part of TLR

1500
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,320
later a reaction

1501
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,960
But the weird thing is that it happens in some places

1502
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,320
It's the throat, the palms, the soles of the feet.

1503
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,600
Can the teacher give me some advice?

1504
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,400
That is why it only looks like this in these places

1505
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,200
Is there any marker

1506
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,320
I can look for this

1507
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,200
Thanks

1508
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,880
The first question is to say

1509
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,840
Is there any way we can contract these symptoms from it

1510
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,240
Made back to what kind of virus it is

1511
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,560
In fact, this problem is a bit difficult

1512
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,040
because

1513
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
you know our body

1514
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
suppose today

1515
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We have today that sequencing technology called automatic

1516
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Next Generation Sequencing Technology

1517
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
You know suppose to put a person

1518
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
After all the DNA is extracted from the whole body

1519
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Ask your body's DNA

1520
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's the DNA in your 23-pair display body

1521
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Approximately how much DNA is in your body

1522
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Does this student have any idea

1523
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Weird question, isn't it?

1524
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Shouldn't knowledge be protected? Baidu is my DNA.

1525
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
You first look at how much of your own DNA is in your house

1526
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
According to scientists' estimates, only about 20%

1527
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
what does that mean

1528
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
80% of your body

1529
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
There are many microorganic

1530
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
exists in your body

1531
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
you have no idea who he is

1532
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
He was with you all his life

1533
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
This is what we now use to sequence

1534
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
So the answer to the question is to say

1535
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
when we have one

1536
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You come to pronounce the reaction especially in the hospital

1537
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I often spray that called

1538
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
ass earrings

1539
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
then have a fever

1540
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
don't know anything

1541
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
now of course

1542
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Of course we have some sequencing technology to know who

1543
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
but even if you want to know who he is

1544
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It's a long way to do treatment with you

1545
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
That's why we do research

1546
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That is to say, what I just said

1547
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Viruses that can cause severe cell-based viruses actually have a characteristic

1548
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
That is to say, he will stimulate MACOFIG

1549
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
He will stimulate MACOFIG

1550
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
For example, let's talk about some slower viruses

1551
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
For example, your Baxinian virus

1552
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Some lots of virus or hepatitis B virus

1553
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Will he cause a cytomegalo storm?

1554
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
he won't do so much

1555
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
So it will cause a cytogenetic storm

1556
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Almost all will stimulate MACOFIG

1557
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
despinocytes

1558
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So you said how to treat

1559
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
This is also the purpose of our research

1560
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
We treat these 5A

1561
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
This is the first time to prove our concept that

1562
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Our MACOFIG is

1563
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
There is a receptor on it

1564
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
will detect the virus and cause an inflammatory response

1565
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
The problem is that playing 5A doesn't work either.

1566
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Of course you can think about our receptors

1567
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
so many

1568
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,900
It is unnecessary to know all viruses

1569
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,720
you rely on this

1570
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,560
Our general Kang Ben trial to participate in feel

1571
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,220
Why do I have so many receptors to bless him so powerfully?

1572
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,060
So it must not be all

1573
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,420
So in fact, what we are studying now has been

1574
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:17,320
Not just researching upstream anymore

1575
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,360
We're now looking at the downstream messaging that says he

1576
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,800
His message is that he is going down

1577
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,020
how is this passed down

1578
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,920
Then we can find a common ground to do

1579
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,260
a comment target

1580
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,540
Basically, there are many of us now

1581
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,320
The pronunciation response is basically cox 2

1582
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,720
we all heard one

1583
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,440
Conscious pronunciation response is the cox 2 inhibitor is basically like this

1584
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,960
Because he often passes through this cox 2 when he pronounces

1585
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,260
So this finds the target

1586
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,380
So we're going to cure the cell tech storm now

1587
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:50,260
We've gone from the earliest days of this

1588
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,760
Upstream, let's find out slowly

1589
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,360
he may have many receptors

1590
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,220
But he's going to have a vocal response at the end

1591
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:57,620
he will be one downstream

1592
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,060
consistent delivery of a message

1593
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So we're trying to find the signal for that message right now

1594
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
then go terminate it

1595
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
In this way we can use a medicine

1596
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
like cox2

1597
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
we do cox2 you will compare almost any reaction

1598
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It won't hurt after you get it down

1599
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Basically the principle is like this

1600
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
We also hope that we can find such a target

1601
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
After that, no matter what kind of virus

1602
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
The cytokine storm everyone created

1603
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
We can all use this in therapy

1604
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Then your third question is to grow virus 71

1605
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
I have done this too

1606
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
long virus 71 it actually

1607
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It does not affect the severe cytokine storm

1608
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So basically this we also experimented with

1609
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
it doesn't stimulate

1610
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
subcell

1611
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It also does not create a cytokine storm

1612
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So the specific symptoms it produces are due to

1613
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
What kind of cell does the virus want to enter?

1614
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
It depends on whether there are receptors on the cell

1615
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
its receptor is

1616
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
receptors that help it get into the cell

1617
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It is different from the receptors of gill translucency syndrome we talked about today

1618
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
So because your body has a specific receptor

1619
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So the virus will go to specific cells

1620
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
like hepatitis virus

1621
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
he actually goes to the liver

1622
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
he won't go anywhere else

1623
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So this type of treatment basically

1624
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It will be different from the strategy we talked about today.

1625
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
So this scientific question is actually

1626
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
There is no way to solve it with just one ability

1627
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
so doing cell trends is my specialty

1628
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
But you just mentioned longevity poison 71

1629
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
presumably have a different strategy

1630
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
For example, the most common thing is that everyone is developing vaccines.

1631
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
For longevity poison, it is said that this clinical trial

1632
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
seems to be ok

1633
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Report on road seems to be all right

1634
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
So this requires a different strategy to treat

1635
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
But the example I am talking about today is the most important

1636
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
All are based on cell trend storm

1637
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
thank you teacher

1638
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I want to ask

1639
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Recently, it is often heard that pharmaceutical companies are developing

1640
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Lantern fever vaccine

1641
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,840
It is because he has many similar blood types due to the dengue virus

1642
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,840
But so it often happens that there is no way

1643
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,340
All types can be protected

1644
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,540
So the development is not so smooth

1645
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,040
Then I just want to listen to Mr. Xie's speech

1646
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,080
This 5A

1647
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,460
The will seems to be quite effective and quite tangible.

1648
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,260
That

1649
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,720
And there are antibodies

1650
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,640
Is there any pharmaceutical company willing to go?

1651
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:22,920
to this direction

1652
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:23,920
5A go

1653
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,000
Are you developing this drug?

1654
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,580
Thanks

1655
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,580
dengue virus

1656
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,580
just two questions

1657
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,580
one is the vaccine

1658
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,580
because vaccines do

1659
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:34,580
inside all vaccines

1660
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,580
And every time I see manufacturers of dengue vaccines, I say you are very brave.

1661
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,580
Just pick the hardest one in the world to do

1662
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,580
because he has a different

1663
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:43,580
four blood types

1664
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:48,580
Then we all know that dengue virus infection has a special phenomenon called

1665
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:49,580
is the antibody

1666
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,580
It is a phenomenon called AD

1667
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,580
It's your antibody

1668
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,580
As long as you can only synthesize one type

1669
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,580
But if it cannot be combined with other types

1670
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,580
that sometimes he is a disaster

1671
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,720
when it cannot neutralize other types

1672
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,240
The presence of this antibody prevents the disease from becoming more serious

1673
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,640
So doing vaccines

1674
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,200
it's a big challenge

1675
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,440
how do you promise to say

1676
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,480
Get vaccinated after entering alone

1677
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,560
He can produce antibodies

1678
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:13,600
protect everything

1679
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,200
this is a big challenge

1680
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,400
So of course it shouldn't be difficult

1681
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,880
so as to say

1682
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,760
Can it be used to treat diseases

1683
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,480
i just said

1684
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,960
when we published earlier

1685
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,000
In fact, we have authorized a manufacturer in Chinese

1686
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,240
let's give us some more money

1687
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,200
Then do this experiment

1688
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,840
but i just said

1689
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,080
when you go to therapy

1690
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,360
Antibodies are basically more expensive

1691
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,520
The other is the time you talked about

1692
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,160
Someone just asked me

1693
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,120
when is it effective

1694
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,160
all infectious diseases

1695
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,560
like you eat the gram flu

1696
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,840
The sooner you eat, the more effective

1697
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,520
Does that have a preventive effect?

1698
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,280
With your blessing

1699
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:50,760
i never did

1700
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,360
Bless you before you get infected

1701
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,840
After you get the antibody first

1702
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,880
it fights again

1703
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,280
basically it will help

1704
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,360
So who is going to buy this antibody

1705
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,120
I often say should

1706
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,720
should be sold to the U.S. Department of Defense

1707
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,000
The United States likes to send giants to fight all over the world

1708
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,320
So it's better to get up first and then go to war

1709
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,600
he may be asymptomatic

1710
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,320
But after all, it is more impractical

1711
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,120
Most of the sick spots are because he's already infected

1712
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,560
he has symptoms

1713
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,800
Then he started to take medicine

1714
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,560
So in practice

1715
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,560
Although using antibodies to prove that we are infected

1716
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,440
but you have to make a drug

1717
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,720
Antibodies are not optimal

1718
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,760
Because your house is not playing very early

1719
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,160
Because after many viruses are infected

1720
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:32,800
We know that when a virus enters the body it produces a disease called

1721
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:33,800
called Biremia

1722
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,360
There is a virus all over the world

1723
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,800
But his experiment won't be very long

1724
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,880
he'll be gone in a few days

1725
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,960
so at this time

1726
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,720
He welcomes the reaction while it's in progress

1727
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,440
we did experiments

1728
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,160
Suppose we play very late

1729
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,240
The later you beat him, the worse the effect will be.

1730
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,760
So now our new treatment target

1731
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,200
It's that we're studying his messaging.

1732
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,360
It just depends on which virus he drives.

1733
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,000
Which % tax is the messaging

1734
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,160
We hope to use small molecule drugs

1735
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,040
Able to be like Costool

1736
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Go to Tarkey those specific molecules

1737
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
then come for treatment

1738
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
This is probably more realistic

1739
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
This is what we are working on now

1740
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
JV

1741
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
X

1742
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
hello chase

1743
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
i want to ask two questions

1744
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
the first one is you

1745
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
The lectures on knowledge and karma are mentioned above.

1746
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
In the future, this receptor may be a

1747
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
One of the treatments for the red wolf

1748
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
A New Direction for Calibration

1749
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
can you explain it to us

1750
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
The second is to say that in fact, in your recent

1751
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It is on the Nature Combination

1752
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It is mentioned that

1753
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
This receptor-deficient keratin in the liver

1754
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
lead to more severe inflammation

1755
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
can you explain it to us

1756
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
The two questions you just asked are

1757
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
In our recent post that

1758
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
In the Nature Communications article

1759
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
What kind of function does this receptor have?

1760
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
We found that this receptor basically

1761
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
He not only knows about viruses

1762
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
He will also know Seohyun

1763
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Why do this research?

1764
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,520
Because if you think about it, how can our body have a society to make it?

1765
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,520
Made you sick

1766
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,520
isn't that reasonable

1767
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,520
So it must have some other function

1768
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,120
then we're in a place where we have a chance to find out that it's actually

1769
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Another cell in the body is called

1770
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,320
Granules are tetraneutrophils

1771
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:22,820
English called New Show Pair

1772
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,320
It also performs very well

1773
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,320
What about this cell?

1774
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,320
when it is activated

1775
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,320
it produces a special phenomenon

1776
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
will generate a structure called Nate

1777
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,320
is that it spits out the DNA

1778
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,320
That is, after the cell expands, it will spit out the DNA

1779
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,320
After spitting it out, its DNA will be sticky

1780
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,320
Then stick the bacteria

1781
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,320
After sticking bacteria

1782
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,320
it will keep the bacteria expanding

1783
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,320
So the DNA issue you just mentioned is to say

1784
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,320
it gets very inflamed in the liver

1785
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,320
but just say

1786
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,320
Suppose you get a bacterial infection

1787
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,320
Then when this infection

1788
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,320
If there are five of them

1789
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
In fact, your anti-bacterial effect will be greatly reduced

1790
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
This is to talk about the importance of public opinion treatment

1791
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
that is, you have to use the right

1792
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Just like we are using this NTI-TNF to treat

1793
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
This cracking wind is the same as the joint point, what is the consequence?

1794
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Its price is that it causes tuberculosis

1795
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
so get tuberculosis

1796
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So the same, suppose in the future you want the Receptor Tarkey to do this Parsway

1797
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
You may be at risk

1798
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Do you supercharge certain susceptibility to bacterial infections

1799
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
This is to answer your second question

1800
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Then why do you say it has something to do with the red savage wolf cabin?

1801
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
you this is what we are doing

1802
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Because the red savage wolf cabin is basically considered to say

1803
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
It is because NUCHOFILIER that net generates too much

1804
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So we actually did some experiments

1805
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
is when it has too much net

1806
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It is true that these five bits are a very important factor to control the net structure generated by NUCHOFILIER

1807
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So ours is a discussion

1808
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,020
If the overproduction of this net is related to 5A

1809
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:06,900
In the future, it is possible for us to use the 5A of consciousness

1810
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:08,600
To be aware that this net produces

1811
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,100
Then go to realize the sex sac growth of red ants

1812
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,760
This is of course a long-term inference.

1813
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:14,760
basically like this

1814
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
thank you thank you for your question

1815
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
The first question is also closed on the pre-influenza

1816
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
This is indeed what we have considered

1817
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Its importance in the future of influenza viruses

1818
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Because of dengue virus it can't have

1819
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
The Importance of the Influenza Virus

1820
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
So we in this question

1821
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
we are in this problem

1822
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
we are in this problem

1823
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
we are in this problem

1824
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
we are in this problem

1825
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
we are in this problem

1826
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
we are in this problem

1827
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Because dengue virus it after all the vast majority of people

1828
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
In fact, dengue virus is actually the vast majority of people

1829
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Its symptoms are not obvious

1830
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
it really gets serious

1831
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
only about 10%

1832
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
There will be more serious symptoms

1833
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And most of them are in Taiwan

1834
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Older, less resistant

1835
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
But the flu virus is different

1836
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
flu virus your symptoms

1837
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
when you are infected

1838
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Especially the one that reacts very strongly sometimes

1839
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
so this is really serious

1840
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So we use the flu virus

1841
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Basically the idea is

1842
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
You just said you didn't do it

1843
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,400
Because dengue virus has only four lines

1844
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,200
That flu virus has so many lines

1845
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,400
So let's say we have a flu virus

1846
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,000
You can also find a common pathway

1847
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,300
Is it possible to realize the western foundation caused by influenza virus

1848
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,800
it's really what we think

1849
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,300
so we have been doing

1850
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,600
So our treatment method is basically

1851
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,200
When I came up with this idea

1852
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,200
In fact, it subverts the general idea

1853
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,000
Because normally we treat viral infections

1854
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,500
The first thought is whether there is a drug

1855
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,000
able to realize it replicates

1856
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,500
it won't copy

1857
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,500
it won't have disease

1858
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,200
But why something like this

1859
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,200
challenged for some reason

1860
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,500
It's because the virus mutates sometimes

1861
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:38,100
it will not be healed

1862
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,900
Another reason is that

1863
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:41,700
that virus hypothetical

1864
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,100
when it has entered the body

1865
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,000
elicit a vocal response

1866
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,400
You are healing the replication and it is too late

1867
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,800
it's been a lot

1868
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,700
so you just said you didn't say

1869
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,800
we make this drug

1870
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,200
Another purpose of doing this research

1871
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,800
really hope to find a virus after infection

1872
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,600
inside the macroscopic cells

1873
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,700
A common path that elicits an articulatory response

1874
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,000
Find a cure from hope

1875
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
is so

1876
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,240
Then you obviously know my details.

1877
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,000
you also know i do this

1878
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,500
There is nothing wrong with K-Z's treatment

1879
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:09,740
I actually did this first

1880
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:12,840
Doing the radiation tumor treatment in various ways

1881
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,440
For cancer, you use a lot

1882
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,340
Institute of Cancer Drugs

1883
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:20,440
After treatment, there will indeed be more immune responses

1884
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:24,240
including some that can cause allergic reactions

1885
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,840
some just cause that skin

1886
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,580
It will itch and hurt

1887
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:33,840
This base rotation is actually quite interesting

1888
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,280
But I haven't researched this field yet

1889
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,280
but i believe

1890
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,440
All of these things are what I'm talking about today

1891
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,680
The circle in the first picture is related

1892
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,280
Because no matter what kind of disease

1893
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,440
almost always

1894
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,480
it elicits a vocal response

1895
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,080
It must be stimulating our body

1896
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,640
a certain partsway

1897
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,740
caused by a receptor

1898
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,680
so bless says

1899
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:57,120
Someone is particularly interested in this

1900
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,220
He might be able to use something like

1901
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,020
go find out

1902
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,700
After chemotherapy or various medications that we do

1903
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,900
what element does it produce

1904
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,600
what kind of receptors to stimulate

1905
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,800
Then I believe there is still a lot to be done.

1906
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,100
is possible to find a way to suppress its inflammatory response

1907
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,300
Hello

1908
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,600
I want to ask about this 5A receptor

1909
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,300
It is mainly through which transfer molecule

1910
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,400
to open the downstream bacteria

1911
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,200
And I saw a slide

1912
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:39,000
It's written that it activates this NLRP3, the inflammatory payload

1913
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,300
Then it is through increasing the protein of this load body

1914
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:46,500
or increase its aggregation

1915
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,200
Then there is another

1916
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,200
For this feeling you have about this and that Cyrolyte Dome

1917
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,000
That is to say, it actually said at the beginning

1918
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,400
It will first initiate some of the more important Cyrokyne

1919
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,000
and then cause the entire

1920
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,840
Or is it that he turned on the entire Path bit from the beginning?

1921
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,840
Then all the track cards come out

1922
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:10,540
that's a very good question

1923
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:12,300
That's what we've been doing lately

1924
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:17,500
That is, since we discovered that many viruses can stimulate 5A

1925
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,540
We are very interested in his next entry

1926
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,540
How is the entry of interest passed on?

1927
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:25,940
So the first research we did was to do this inflamed body

1928
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:29,540
Because inflammation is now a very important Path bit

1929
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:30,940
they have a fever together

1930
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,540
Denge Fever is actually called Denge Fever

1931
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,840
It is because when this patient is infected

1932
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,040
He develops a very bad temperature and a high fever

1933
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,740
So we were wondering

1934
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:42,940
Then why does it cause this fever

1935
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,240
It proves that this path is also taken

1936
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,240
Because he has the ability to activate the inflammatory body

1937
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,740
Then will he have any other paths?

1938
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,540
this is what we are doing now

1939
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:58,340
Because few people did 5A research in the past

1940
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,940
Because I don't know who is on him

1941
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Then do this kind of pronunciation response. Many people have studied this message transmission in the past.

1942
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
They are all lions, this lion is provocative and eats you know

1943
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Because they don't like to be a giant cell

1944
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
What I want to say is that it is very hard for us to do this kind of research

1945
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
We're all going to use mouse cells or human blood cells

1946
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
The reason is because many people are researchers and I also want to use cell pigs

1947
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Doing Cell Pigs vs. People Doing Research

1948
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
good people who do cancer research

1949
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Because cancer is cells that are absent

1950
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
So a lot of the results with Cellpigs are pretty good

1951
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
we have to react

1952
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
We bless with a cell pig

1953
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
when infected with a virus

1954
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It will react like our mouse

1955
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Cellular reaction with human blood

1956
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
totally different

1957
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So it's really hard for us to do this experiment.

1958
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
So the questions you just mentioned

1959
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
What is its downstream

1960
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
We now probably know that it is downstream through SYK

1961
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Then after passing through the downstream, you will eat a Buddha chair

1962
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
buddhist tree

1963
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,600
But there is a big gap in the middle

1964
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,900
we don't know

1965
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:05,700
This is the direction of our current research

1966
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,100
This is back to what I just said

1967
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:09,500
the path of this study

1968
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,400
This study is actually a continuation of the work

1969
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,000
is endless

1970
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,300
We are now hoping that before I retire

1971
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,900
To be able to figure out the dirty path

1972
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,800
Then come again maybe I'll have a chance to be here next time

1973
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,600
share my work with you

1974
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,700
and then be able to give you more clarity

1975
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,300
A more satisfactory answer would be this

1976
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Thanks

1977
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Any question

1978
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
ok, may I ask the lady

1979
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
thank you

1980
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Because I was late just now and there was a miss in front of me

1981
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
so you might mention

1982
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
maybe i didn't hear you clearly

1983
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
As for the cause of the inflammation you just mentioned

1984
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
some of them are viruses

1985
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
One of them mentioned is that

1986
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
What about urea crystallization?

1987
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
i want to understand

1988
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Normally, our urea will crystallize, that's right.

1989
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
But what is causing it to over crystallize?

1990
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
can understand

1991
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Thanks

1992
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Thanks

1993
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,500
Thanks

1994
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:05,380
Crystallization is of course the first

1995
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:06,780
The basic reason is because it

1996
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:07,580
it's high

1997
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:08,620
because it's as high as a

1998
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,480
Worse than that spiritual point

1999
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,820
you call it crystallization

2000
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:12,180
But crystallization occurs in the body

2001
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,180
there are many factors

2002
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,220
such as blood circulation

2003
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:16,260
Because you see where most of Pain likes to be

2004
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,420
like in this

2005
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,020
thumbs up

2006
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,520
That's because the temperature of the feet is relatively low

2007
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,860
So it is easier to crystallize

2008
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,560
but there are other factors

2009
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,460
also cause crystallization

2010
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:25,860
so

2011
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:29,860
The factors that cause crystallization are actually

2012
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,860
some people

2013
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,660
still working on

2014
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:32,460
because

2015
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,960
Many people have high uric acid

2016
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,160
but it won't gout

2017
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,260
There are also such patients

2018
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:36,900
it has high uric acid

2019
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:37,700
but it won't explain

2020
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:38,740
it won't hurt

2021
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,760
so

2022
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,240
What other factors determine

2023
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:42,140
will it be sexual

2024
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,640
it crystallizes

2025
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,600
In addition to the physical factors we know

2026
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,200
Temperature definitely affects beyond its melting point

2027
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,840
there are other things we don't know very well

2028
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,680
I don't know, let me exchange opinions

2029
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,120
that's because

2030
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,580
i do sports nutrition

2031
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:57,720
that athlete

2032
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,120
because he's doing this

2033
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,800
this explosive movement

2034
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,400
it produces a lot of halo acids

2035
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,200
When the haloic acid rises

2036
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,600
will decrease

2037
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,400
excretion of uric acid

2038
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,400
Normal uric acid will partly come out of our urine

2039
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,600
normal situation

2040
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,400
But it also reduces its excretion

2041
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,400
so it builds up in the blood

2042
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,400
Therefore, it is more likely for this kind of person to experience pain and collapse.

2043
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,200
We say explosive movement

2044
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:24,200
What if in this way of speaking

2045
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,400
Then if we exercise too much

2046
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,600
Is it also because some cause some athletes

2047
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,400
more prone to infection

2048
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,800
This injury results in permanent sports damage

2049
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,800
Thanks

2050
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,600
Although I'm not very...

2051
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,000
i don't exercise

2052
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,400
My guide is regular exercise

2053
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,600
Actually it is

2054
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,200
In fact, after exercising

2055
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,200
body tissue will be injured

2056
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,400
so many athletes

2057
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,800
he is actually now

2058
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,800
just after exercising

2059
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,600
He likes to eat that high protein

2060
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,000
because when you are exercising a lot

2061
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
including your muscles

2062
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,200
Muscles do...

2063
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,600
He... our muscles are sore after exercising

2064
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,600
In fact, it's a bit...wrong. You just mentioned that the host finished eating.

2065
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,840
This is where many of our normal machine packs die

2066
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,160
So you have to eat a lot of albumin and then supplement it

2067
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,160
so you just said nothing wrong

2068
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,400
In fact, that is an over-exercise person.

2069
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,680
Because he is the same inside

2070
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,920
movement from a certain point of view

2071
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,880
Back to the round one I started with

2072
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,600
is the constant state

2073
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,760
your extreme exercise

2074
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,080
In fact, it is also a pressure on the body

2075
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,080
Stress also produces a so-called steady state

2076
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,760
So intense exercise can actually produce an inflammatory response

2077
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,560
there's nothing wrong with that

2078
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,760
so many athletes

2079
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,440
Many people say athletes are healthy

2080
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,360
Actually, go and see that

2081
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:38,000
Explain that athletes do not live longer than average

2082
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,240
They sometimes say that sports cause different injuries

2083
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,240
In fact, it will cause all kinds of occupational injuries

2084
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,880
So there is no saying that the movement itself is also

2085
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,560
A very important factor that promotes the inflammatory response

2086
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,200
It will accelerate the progress of many diseases

2087
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,200
there is another one, right?

2088
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,040
there are two more

2089
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,040
another one

2090
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,040
another one

2091
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
has a problem

2092
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You seem to be ready to give me an answer.

2093
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
In my other research, Dean Liu just said that I am also working on a molecule.

2094
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
How he put this giant cell it has two types

2095
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It is M1, which is the inflammation of the blood-spraying multi-cell technology that I just mentioned

2096
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
But another one called M2 basically it's anti-inflammatory

2097
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
we did

2098
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,400
We have done a study

2099
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:07,000
We have done research and used this flu virus to trigger Diuchen's severe inflammation.

2100
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And then we'll just beat that protein in

2101
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,400
Just like you say it makes M1 become M2

2102
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,600
It is true that its entire inflammatory response is reduced.

2103
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,600
Then its death rate also decreased

2104
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,000
So if your family is interested

2105
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,800
Give me the memory film, I can show you the Payback meter

2106
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,800
really works

2107
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,800
are we the last question

2108
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,800
department

2109
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,800
and a copy of that scientific magazine

2110
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,800
still me

2111
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:50,800
Oh, good

2112
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,800
I just talked a lot about the loss of immunity

2113
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,800
The sky cannon window and the sky cannon window

2114
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:10,800
Is there any new progress in these two current materials or research?

2115
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,300
i didn't do my homework sorry

2116
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:20,800
Sky gun window in English is Penfix

2117
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,000
You are asking a good question. Wenyong’s here belongs to the P department.

2118
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,300
Ji Biwen has an expert in the P department here, that is our Liu Wuyan miscellaneous

2119
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,300
right

2120
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,300
Liu Wuyan can study Penfix's current Treatment

2121
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:39,300
no fact

2122
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:47,300
I mean, it's an autoimmune disease.

2123
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:54,300
So it has nothing to do with the cell base storm

2124
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,300
But it's also about immunity

2125
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,300
so far

2126
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,800
There really aren't that many good self-disciplines

2127
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,120
That is to rely on the inner stock market

2128
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,680
Inner stock market or this method of suppressing the immune response

2129
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,120
over there

2130
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,560
how to use this

2131
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,600
How does this immune system cause autoimmunity

2132
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,560
Then treat according to that mechanism

2133
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,760
In fact there is still a lot of room

2134
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,280
So there's a lot more in immunology

2135
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,880
can be discussed

2136
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,560
and find some way

2137
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,240
Because these students and teachers just said in the past

2138
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,640
It is said that it is done by the inner stock city

2139
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,040
He takes the good and the bad

2140
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,640
that's not the best way

2141
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,440
But the method so far is to use

2142
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,560
A high amount of domestic stock market will do it

2143
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,160
right

2144
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,960
In fact, the disease can be suppressed

2145
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,320
right

2146
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,880
But let me analyze

2147
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,960
very interesting

2148
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,160
like i talk a little too much

2149
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,280
Today the protagonist is

2150
01:22:59,280 --> 01:22:59,920
now to say

2151
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
It's just that we have a treatment that's not the best

2152
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
it's not enough by itself

2153
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
But it can reduce the amount of internal memory used

2154
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
is called IVIG

2155
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Just take that person's immigrant globulin

2156
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Just look at it's in the blood

2157
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
it is going to

2158
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
In the case of a company, 100, 300, or thousands of people will be

2159
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
The immigrant globulin is separated from Dong Nei's blood

2160
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
is imcanti

2161
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
No, it's IGG

2162
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
then hit the patient

2163
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
I don't know why

2164
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
It's going to stop this autoimmune reaction

2165
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
it can be done over there

2166
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
current thinking says

2167
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:53,000
It has something to do with the biological blood of that sugar

2168
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
it can will

2169
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
That is the autoimmunity

2170
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
right

2171
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
good

2172
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Yes or no

2173
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,600
to the scientific man magazine

2174
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,600
can share with him

2175
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,600
another one

2176
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
there is none left

2177
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:09,800
OK

2178
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:10,800
It does not matter

2179
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,800
we are

2180
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,200
come again or continue

2181
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:13,800
keep talking

2182
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,000
let me ask

2183
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,600
that cell storm theory

2184
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,200
Is there any correlation for an antioxidant

2185
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,600
especially this one

2186
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,200
chicken flower

2187
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,200
please advise on this

2188
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,200
Actually in the pronunciation response

2189
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,400
one of the features

2190
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,200
I just said that inside Cytogenetic Storm

2191
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:34,800
One of them includes free muscle

2192
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,200
free muscle

2193
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,200
so free muscle

2194
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,200
In fact, it also caused many

2195
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,000
a cause of cell damage

2196
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,200
because it's a lot

2197
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,200
After becoming a free muscle

2198
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,800
it will spray water

2199
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,000
it becomes a whole desoiled

2200
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,800
it oxidizes many things

2201
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,400
So it also causes

2202
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,600
cause of injury

2203
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:52,400
So in the past it was said

2204
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,200
Anti-free muscle drugs

2205
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,800
in anti-inflammatory

2206
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:56,600
it works

2207
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,800
But it only works for that

2208
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,200
mild inflammation

2209
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,200
it will work

2210
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
But for cell-based storms so severe

2211
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
That is, its strength compared to the cell base

2212
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
it's much weaker

2213
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
So just relying on free machines

2214
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
To treat such a powerful technological storm

2215
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
